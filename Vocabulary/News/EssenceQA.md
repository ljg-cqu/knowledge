### Q1: Essence of a daily news habit vs endless scrolling

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: Everyday reader designing a news habit  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Reader, Citizen] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You follow news through several apps, social feeds, newsletters, and TV snippets. You often scroll late at night, jumping between shocking headlines, arguments in the comments, and short videos. You feel overloaded, anxious, and still unsure what actually matters for your life, work, or local community. You only have about 20–30 minutes per day that you can realistically devote to staying informed. You want a simple, repeatable way to keep up with important news without doomscrolling or missing key developments.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your daily news habit.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **why each cluster matters** and **what kinds of content or behaviour you would consciously de-prioritize or drop**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - A fixed daily time budget and clear viewing window.  
  - A short list of primary, trusted sources.  
  - A small set of priority topics (e.g., local, national, a few global themes).  
  - Rules for notifications and social feeds (when and how to open them).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *What to Follow (Sources & Topics)*: Choose 1–2 main outlets or newsletters plus a few priority beats; ignore random trending stories that don’t touch your life, work, or values.  
  - *How to Follow (Routine & Format)*: Use one scheduled 20–30 minute block, preferably earlier in the day, focusing on summaries and a few deep reads instead of constant micro-checks.  
  - *What to Avoid (Triggers & Distractions)*: Turn off most breaking alerts and late-night checks; avoid comment sections and outrage threads that add emotion but not understanding.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive practical choices about apps, alerts, and reading time so that “keeping up with the news” becomes a bounded habit instead of endless scrolling.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track “minutes of intentional news time per day” and “number of summary pieces vs random clicks.” First stabilise the time window, then improve source quality.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Adding more apps instead of pruning; letting rare emergencies justify constant checking.

### Q2: Essence of prioritising newsroom coverage under time pressure

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: News editor at a digital outlet  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Editor, Reporter, Audience, Publisher] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are a news editor for a mid-sized digital outlet. On a busy weekday morning, you have more potential stories than reporters: a local chemical spill, a national election debate, a tech company’s layoffs, a celebrity scandal, and a follow-up on a long-running housing investigation. Your homepage can feature only 3–4 top stories, and social media slots are limited. Leadership wants you to "prioritise what really matters" while still keeping traffic and subscriptions healthy. You must decide what to assign, what to lead with, and what to delay or skip.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should drive which stories you prioritise.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** (e.g., Impact / Operations / Audience) and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster changes concrete assignment and placement decisions**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Public impact and urgency (safety, rights, money, democratic process).  
  - Availability of strong, verifiable reporting (sources, visuals, context).  
  - Fit with your outlet’s mission and audience expectations.  
  - Diversity of coverage (not all politics, not all crime, etc.).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Impact & Duty to Inform*: Lead with stories that affect health, safety, and core civic decisions (e.g., chemical spill, election debate) even if they are less clickable than celebrity gossip.  
  - *Feasibility & Risk*: Prioritise stories where you have reporters, sources, and data to publish responsibly; delay or downplay those that are under-reported or likely to require major corrections.  
  - *Audience & Brand Fit*: Ensure at least one high-interest piece that reflects your outlet’s strengths (e.g., housing investigation follow-up), reinforcing why loyal readers return.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide who gets assigned where, which stories go to the homepage hero slot, and which ones become short briefs or are skipped.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Watch “share of homepage space on high-impact public-interest stories” and “correction rate on rushed pieces.” Prioritise impact and accuracy, then fine-tune traffic.

### Q3: Essence of handling a viral but unverified story

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Social media editor / fact-checker in a newsroom  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Fact-checker, Editor, Platform Team, Audience] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
A shocking video claiming to show misconduct by a public official is going viral on social media. Competing outlets are already sharing it with strong language. Your newsroom has only limited information: an unverified uploader account, no confirmed location, and a few conflicting eyewitness comments. Management asks you to "move fast but not be wrong." You must recommend whether to share, cautiously frame, label, or hold the story while fact-checking, knowing that delay may cost clicks but a mistake could damage trust.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape your decision about amplifying the story.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to guide similar decisions in the future.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Strength and traceability of the original source (account history, metadata, corroboration).  
  - Availability of independent confirmation (other outlets, officials, documents).  
  - Potential harm if the claim is wrong (reputation, safety, legal risk).  
  - Reversibility and visibility of any amplification you do.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Evidence & Verification*: Require at least one strong independent confirmation or clear contextual information before framing the claim as fact; until then, treat it explicitly as unverified.  
  - *Risk & Exposure*: Weigh the possible public benefit of fast reporting against reputational and legal damage from spreading a false accusation; adjust reach (headline tone, placement, paid promotion) accordingly.  
  - *Timing & Communication*: If you mention the story, label it clearly as unverified, explain what you know and do not know, and commit to visible updates as facts emerge.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine whether you share, how prominently, and with what disclaimers, shaping trust more than raw speed.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track “ratio of corrections / takedowns on viral stories,” “time-to-verification,” and “share of viral items clearly labelled as unverified.” First minimise harmful errors, then refine speed.

### Q4: Essence of designing a trustworthy local morning briefing

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a local news app  
**Criticality**: [Stakeholders, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Product Manager, Editor-in-chief, Engineer, Reader] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are designing a new local morning briefing for a news app. Users say they want to "be informed" but not spend more than 5–10 minutes each morning. The newsroom wants to highlight in-depth investigations, while business teams care about engagement and subscriptions. You cannot include everything: crime, politics, weather, schools, transport, national and global headlines, plus opinion pieces. You must define what the briefing is *for*, what it always includes, and what it will intentionally leave out or only link to.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that define what a "trustworthy local briefing" should emphasise.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Clarify **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** so the product stays focused and understandable.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - A clear promise about what users will reliably get each morning (e.g., key local civic, safety, and practical updates).  
  - Transparent sourcing and links to deeper coverage.  
  - A strict time/length budget that shapes story selection and format.  
  - Limited, carefully chosen opinion or analysis pieces.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Core Content Scope*: Always include a small set of must-know items (local government decisions, major incidents, transport/school disruptions, one national/global headline) and short bullets linking to full articles.  
  - *Trust & Transparency*: Show source, time of last update, and why each item was chosen; avoid clickbait framing and clearly separate news from opinion.  
  - *Delivery & Boundaries*: Cap reading time and number of items; opinion, lifestyle, and lighter stories live in separate sections, not the core briefing.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: concise, high-impact local updates plus essential context. Out-of-scope: full article text, long features, and reactive social chatter.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters guide product design, editorial rules, and success metrics so the briefing becomes a dependable daily ritual, not another noisy feed.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track “completion rate,” “average time spent,” and “trust / usefulness scores” from surveys. First make the briefing finishable, then deepen value.

### Q5: Essence of teaching students to read news critically

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Teacher designing a media literacy module  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Teacher, Student, Parent, School Leader] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are planning a short media literacy unit for secondary-school students. You have four 45-minute lessons to help them read news more critically. There are many possible topics: how newsrooms work, social media algorithms, misinformation, bias, source checking, opinion vs fact, and more. You cannot cover everything in depth. You want students to leave with a few simple tools they can actually use when they see news on their phones.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that matter most for improving how students read news.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** for a realistic 4-lesson plan.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Distinguishing fact reporting from opinion and advertising.  
  - Checking who the source is and how the story is supported.  
  - Spotting common signs of bias and misleading headlines.  
  - Practising a short checklist on real articles they already see.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Core Concepts & Language*: Teach a small shared vocabulary (news vs opinion, source, quote, bias, headline vs body) with simple examples so students can talk about what they see.  
  - *Practice & Feedback*: Spend most classroom time on students applying a 4–5 question checklist to real or recent articles, then discussing in pairs or groups.  
  - *Transfer to Daily Life*: End the unit with a small commitment (e.g., screenshot one news item next week and annotate it using the checklist) to connect lessons to their feeds.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape which content you cut (deep industry detail) and which you emphasise (few concepts + lots of practice), so students actually change how they read news.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track “percentage of students who can correctly label fact vs opinion in short items” and “number of articles analysed with the checklist.” First ensure understanding of core terms, then increase independent use.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Spending too long lecturing about media history; using examples disconnected from students’ real information sources.
