1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of News vocabulary?
   A:

   - **Scope**: Focus on high-leverage vocabulary for talking about news stories, journalism, and media coverage (articles, broadcasts, online posts, and alerts). Excludes deep technical jargon from law or finance, entertainment gossip slang, and full academic media-studies theory.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When people talk about "the news," what basic pieces of information and story structure do they need to express first?
     - How can you describe where news comes from, how well it is verified, and how fairly it represents different sides?
     - How do you talk about different kinds of news content (hard news, analysis, opinion) across print, broadcast, and online channels?

1. Q: Essence card – News as timely, factual information
   A:
   - **Label**: News as timely, factual information
   - **Core Idea**: At its core, news is recent, factual information about events of public interest, gathered from sources and packaged so audiences can understand what happened and why it matters now.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without this basic idea, it is hard to separate real news from rumours, advertising, or opinion, which makes it difficult to judge what information deserves attention or trust.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Content Role = factual report; Time Sensitivity = current / short-term.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - news
     - event
     - public interest
     - factual
     - verified

1. Q: Essence card – Five Ws and article structure
   A:
   - **Label**: Five Ws and article structure
   - **Core Idea**: Effective news language rests on the "Five Ws and H" (who, what, when, where, why, how) plus a simple structure of headline, lead, body, and background that delivers key facts first and detail later.
   - **Why It Matters**: These words and structural terms let you summarise, question, and compare stories; without them, you struggle to explain what a piece of news really says or to notice when crucial information is missing.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Content Role = factual report & background; Time Sensitivity = breaking / developing story.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - headline
     - lead
     - body
     - background
     - who / what / when / where / why / how

1. Q: Essence card – Sources, quotes, and attribution
   A:
   - **Label**: Sources, quotes, and attribution
   - **Core Idea**: Terms like source, eyewitness, spokesperson, quote, "on the record," and "off the record" describe where information comes from and how clearly it is linked to a person or organisation.
   - **Why It Matters**: Understanding and using these words lets you talk about how strong or weak the evidence behind a story is; confusing them blurs the line between confirmed facts, opinions, and unverified claims.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Source & Reliability = direct vs indirect; Channel & Format = interviews, press conferences, documents.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - source
     - eyewitness
     - spokesperson
     - quote
     - on the record / off the record

1. Q: Essence card – Bias, framing, and balance
   A:
   - **Label**: Bias, framing, and balance
   - **Core Idea**: Words such as bias, angle, balanced coverage, editorial, and opinion piece give you language for how a story is framed and whether it aims to inform neutrally or persuade the reader.
   - **Why It Matters**: Media literacy depends on being able to name when coverage is trying to be neutral news versus argument; these terms help you discuss fairness, missing voices, and one-sided reporting.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Content Role = news vs opinion; Source & Reliability = neutral vs advocacy.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - bias
     - angle
     - balanced coverage

     - opinion piece

   - **Core Idea**: Modern news travels through many formats and channels—print articles, TV segments, radio bulletins, websites, apps, newsletters, and social feeds, including short breaking alerts and longer packages.
   - **Why It Matters**: These terms let you describe how people actually receive news and how format affects depth, speed, and attention; without them, different delivery styles all blur into "the news," hiding important differences.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Channel & Format = print / broadcast / online / social; Time Sensitivity = instant alerts vs in-depth coverage.
