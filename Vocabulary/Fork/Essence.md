1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Fork vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Fork*, capture the small set of meanings and collocations that let you talk clearly about forks as physical tools, branching points in space, decision moments, and software/code divergence, plus a few high-impact idioms around money and honesty.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on high-leverage senses of *fork*: the eating utensil and pronged tools; road/river and other physical branching points; metaphorical "fork in the road" for choices; software repository forks; and common idioms (fork over/out, forked tongue, multi-pronged approach). Excludes deep operating-system details of `fork()` calls, specialist mathematics of bifurcation theory, and rare or archaic uses.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When English speakers say *fork*, which few core senses (tool, path, decision, code, idiom) are they usually pointing to?
     - How do you describe things that split into two or more paths in space, time, or logic using *fork* and its near-synonyms?
     - How do you talk about critical choices as a "fork in the road" in life, business, and technology writing?
     - How do you choose between *fork*, *branch*, *split*, and related words in technical and everyday communication so readers are not confused?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Sense Family**: Utensil/tool / Path & flow / Decision metaphor / Software & code / Money & speech idioms.
     - **Literal vs Metaphorical**: Physical objects and shapes vs abstract uses built on the same branching image.
     - **Register**: Neutral everyday vocabulary vs informal idioms vs technical jargon.
     - **Change Direction**: Splitting/branching vs merging/joining (what happens before and after a fork).
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *fork (noun)*: A pronged tool (for eating or lifting) or a point where something like a road, river, or process divides into two parts.
     - *fork (verb)*: To divide into two or more branches, or to create an independent copy of a codebase.
     - *branch*: A part that grows or develops from a main line (tree, organization, code) and continues separately.
     - *split*: A division into parts, often with a sense of separation, disagreement, or rupture.
     - *fork in the road*: A point where a path divides and you must choose which way to go; often used for life or business decisions.
     - *fork a repository*: To create your own copy of someone else's codebase so you can develop it independently.
     - *prong / tine*: Each pointed part of a fork or fork-shaped object.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Shape & space vocabulary; Movement and path vocabulary; Software development basics; Money & payment verbs; Communication about honesty and trust.
     - **Siblings**: Branch, split, junction, divergence; Utensils & tableware; Decision & choice vocabulary; Version-control vocabulary; Idioms about money and deception.
     - **Downstream**: Git workflows and open-source governance; Explaining branching architectures; Designing multi-pronged strategies; Teaching idioms in business and political communication.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: [Blocks, Roles, Action].
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: English learners, language teachers, technical writers, software developers, product managers, business communicators.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.

1. Q: Essence card – Fork as pronged tool and shape
   A:
   - **Label**: Fork as pronged tool and shape
   - **Core Idea**: The most basic sense of *fork* is a pronged tool (eating utensil, pitchfork, tuning fork), whose pointed parts (tines/prongs) define the visual shape that all other meanings build on.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without this literal core, idioms and technical uses lose their anchor; learners cannot understand phrases like *multi-pronged strategy* or *tuning fork* if they do not first picture the physical tool.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Sense Family = Utensil/tool; Literal vs Metaphorical = literal; Register = everyday to semi-technical.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - fork (noun)
     - prong / tine
     - pitchfork, tuning fork

1. Q: Essence card – Fork as branching point in space
   A:
   - **Label**: Fork as branching point in space
   - **Core Idea**: A *fork* is also the place where a road, river, path, or process divides into two or more directions, creating distinct branches from a single origin.
   - **Why It Matters**: This spatial sense underlies directions ("take the left fork"), map reading, and technical descriptions of flows; it also feeds directly into abstract ideas of choices and divergent outcomes.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Sense Family = Path & flow; Change Direction = splitting into branches vs merging again later; Register = neutral descriptive.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - fork (noun, place where things divide)
     - junction, branch
     - divergence

1. Q: Essence card – Fork as decision point and life metaphor
   A:
   - **Label**: Fork as decision point and life metaphor
   - **Core Idea**: The idiom *fork in the road* turns a physical split in a path into a mental picture of a choice, where you must select one route and accept that others will be left behind.
   - **Why It Matters**: This metaphor is common in speeches, essays, and business writing; using it well helps you frame key moments as clear alternatives instead of vagueness, while overusing or mixing metaphors creates noise and confusion.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Sense Family = Decision metaphor; Literal vs Metaphorical = strongly metaphorical; Register = neutral to literary.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - fork in the road
     - crossroads, turning point

1. Q: Essence card – Fork in software and version control
   A:
   - **Label**: Fork in software and version control
   - **Core Idea**: In software, to *fork* a repository is to create your own independent copy of a codebase, so development can continue separately from the "upstream" project, even if changes are never merged back.
   - **Why It Matters**: This meaning is central in open-source and product communication: confusing *fork* with *branch* or *clone* hides who owns what, which work is temporary vs permanent, and how collaboration is expected to work.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Sense Family = Software & code; Register = technical; Change Direction = long-term divergence vs short-lived branches.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - fork (verb), fork a repository
     - branch, clone
     - upstream, downstream

1. Q: Essence card – Fork-related idioms for money and honesty
   A:
   - **Label**: Fork-related idioms for money and honesty
   - **Core Idea**: Expressions like *fork over/out* and *speak with a forked tongue* reuse the fork image to talk about reluctant payment and deceptive speech, while *multi-pronged approach* uses prongs to describe strategies with several coordinated parts.
   - **Why It Matters**: These idioms carry strong tone and register; choosing them wisely lets you sound vivid and natural in speech, but using them in the wrong context (formal writing, sensitive topics) can feel rude, unprofessional, or confusing.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Sense Family = Money & speech idioms; Register = informal (fork over/out, forked tongue) vs semi-formal (multi-pronged approach).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - fork over, fork out
     - speak with a forked tongue
     - multi-pronged approach
