1. **Linking Word**: because (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a clause giving the reason or cause for the main clause
   - *Function*: Shows cause-effect relationship; explains reason
   
   **Synonyms**: since, as, due to the fact that, for the reason that
   
   **Antonyms**: although, despite, even though (showing contrast despite reason)
   
   **When to Use**: Explaining why a nap is needed; giving reasons for tiredness; connecting cause to effect; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overuse in formal writing (use varied connectors); don't begin sentences with "because" in formal writing (use "Since" or "As" instead)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Main clause] + because + [reason clause]: I need a nap because I'm exhausted.
   - Because + [reason], [main clause]: Because I didn't sleep well, I need a nap. (less formal)
   - Position: Introduces dependent clause; can be mid-sentence or sentence-initial
   - Punctuation: No comma when because-clause follows main clause; comma when because-clause is fronted
   - Common errors: Starting with "because" in fragments; overuse in academic writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by) + cause (reason)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "bi cause" (by reason of) → "because" (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm taking a nap because I stayed up too late last night.
   - She's sleeping because the baby kept her awake all night.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Rest periods are essential because cognitive performance declines with sustained attention.
   - Participants experienced drowsiness because sleep deprivation affects alertness significantly.

1. **Linking Word**: although / though (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a contrast or unexpected situation despite something being true
   - *Function*: Shows concession; introduces contrasting idea while acknowledging truth of another
   
   **Synonyms**: even though, despite the fact that, while, whereas
   
   **Antonyms**: because, since, therefore (showing agreement/consequence not contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Acknowledging tiredness but stating other priorities; showing conflict between need for rest and other factors
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When there's no contrast (use "and" or other additive); "though" more casual than "although"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - Although + [concession], [main clause]: Although I'm tired, I can't nap now.
   - [Main clause], although + [concession]: I can't nap now, although I'm tired.
   - Position: Can begin sentence or follow main clause
   - Punctuation: Comma separates clauses; comma before "though" at end
   - Common errors: Confusing with "but" (although already shows contrast, adding "but" is redundant)
   
   **Root Analysis**: all (completely) + though (despite)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "althagh" → "although" (even if, despite that)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Although I'm exhausted, I have to finish this before I can nap.
   - I took a nap, though it didn't help much.

   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, preceding
   
   **When to Use**: Describing activities following a nap; explaining what triggered the need for rest; showing sequence

   - [Main clause] + after + [prior event]: I take a nap after lunch.
   - Position: Can introduce sentence or follow main clause
   - Punctuation: Comma when after-clause is fronted; usually no comma when following main clause
   - Common errors: Confusing with "afterwards" (adverb) vs "after" (conjunction/preposition)
   
   **Root Analysis**: after (Old English "æfter" = behind, later)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "æfter" (behind in place or time) → Modern "after"

   **Antonyms**: after, before (sequential not simultaneous)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing what happens during a nap; showing simultaneous actions; contrasting situations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For sequential actions (use "after/before"); when "during" is clearer for time periods
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - While + [ongoing action], [simultaneous action]: While I nap, please keep the noise down.
   - [Main clause] + while + [simultaneous action]: Don't disturb me while I'm sleeping.
   - Position: Can begin sentence or follow main clause
   - Punctuation: Comma when while-clause is fronted; usually no comma when following
   - Common errors: Overusing in formal writing; confusing temporal and contrastive meanings
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (Old English "hwīl" = period of time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwīl" (time, space of time) → "while" (during)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - While I was napping, someone kept calling my phone.
   - Don't make noise while the baby's sleeping.

   - Position: Connects two independent clauses; mid-sentence after comma
   - Punctuation: Comma before "so" when connecting independent clauses
   - Common errors: Comma splice without "so"; overuse in academic writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: so (Old English "swā" = in this way, therefore)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "swā" (thus, in this way) → "so" (therefore)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I stayed up all night, so I really need a nap now.
   - The baby was fussy, so I rocked her until she fell asleep.

   **Etymology**: Old English "gif" (if, whether) → Middle English "if" → Modern "if"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you're tired, just take a nap—you'll feel way better.
   - I'll set an alarm if I decide to sleep.
