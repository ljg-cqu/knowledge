1. **Linking Word**: therefore (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For that reason; as a result or consequence of what has been stated
   - *Function*: Shows logical consequence or conclusion from previous statement
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, thus, hence, as a result, for this reason
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, despite this (showing contrast rather than consequence)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing, logical arguments, explaining cause-and-effect relationships in technical contexts, demonstrating conclusions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (where "so" is more natural), when the logical connection is already obvious, overuse weakens impact
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement of cause]; therefore, [consequence/conclusion]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (after semicolon or period), often followed by comma
   - [Punctuation]: Semicolon before, comma after OR period before, comma after
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Comma splice (using only comma before "therefore"), overuse in adjacent sentences
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (in that place/respect) + fore (before, in front)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English thær (there) + fore (before) → therefore (12th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - MD5 has known vulnerabilities; therefore, we're switching to SHA-256.
   - Hash collisions compromise security; therefore, collision resistance is essential.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Cryptographic hash functions are computationally irreversible; therefore, they provide suitable foundations for password storage mechanisms.
   - The output space is finite while the input space is infinite; therefore, collisions are mathematically inevitable by the pigeonhole principle.

1. **Linking Word**: however (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Nevertheless; in contrast to what has just been stated; despite that
   - *Function*: Shows contrast, qualification, or unexpected outcome relative to previous statement
   
   **Synonyms**: nevertheless, nonetheless, yet, still, but, on the other hand
   
   **Antonyms**: therefore, consequently, thus (showing consequence rather than contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Presenting contrasting information, qualifying previous statements, introducing exceptions or limitations, formal writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When contrast is already signaled, informal speech (where "but" is more natural), beginning of text (nothing to contrast with)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement]; however, [contrasting statement]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), mid-sentence (less formal), typically set off by commas
   - [Punctuation]: Period/semicolon before, comma after; or commas on both sides if mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Comma splice, omitting commas around "however"

   - Hash functions are deterministic; however, this predictability is actually a feature, not a bug.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Explaining reasons, establishing causality, answering "why" questions, both formal and informal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal academic writing (prefer "since," "as," or "due to"), beginning sentences in very formal contexts
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Main clause] because [subordinate clause] OR Because [subordinate clause], [main clause]
   - [Position]: Typically introduces dependent clause; less commonly sentence-initial
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "because" clause if it begins sentence; usually no comma if "because" is mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Sentence fragments ("Because it's secure."), overuse making text repetitive

   **When to Use**: Expressing simultaneity, presenting contrasts, showing temporal relationships, both formal and informal writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "although" or "whereas" would be clearer for contrast, when simple "but" suffices in casual speech
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Main clause] while [subordinate clause] OR While [subordinate clause], [main clause]
   - [Position]: Introduces dependent clause; either beginning or middle of sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "while" clause if sentence-initial; comma before "while" if mid-sentence (for contrast)
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Ambiguity between temporal and contrast meanings, comma errors
