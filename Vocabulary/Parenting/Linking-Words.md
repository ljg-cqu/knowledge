1. **Linking Word**: because (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For the reason that; explains why a rule, decision, or feeling exists.
   - *Function*: Introduces the cause or explanation, often when parents justify limits or routines to children.
   
   **Synonyms**: since, as, due to the fact that, for the reason that
   
   **Antonyms**: although, even though, despite (introduce contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Explaining house rules ("because it’s bedtime"), safety limits ("because the road is dangerous"), or parental decisions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: As the only answer to "why" questions ("because I said so"), which shuts down conversation and learning.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [rule/decision] because [reason] OR Because [reason], [rule/decision]
   - **Position**: mid-sentence or sentence-initial
   - **Punctuation**: comma after introductory "Because" clause at the start of a sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: sentence fragments ("Because you were late." ✗), vague reasons ("Because" alone)
   
   **Root Analysis**: by + cause → because
   
   **Etymology**: From Middle English phrase "by cause" meaning "for the reason that"; now the standard way to introduce explanations.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You can’t play outside alone because it’s already dark.
   - We have to leave now because school starts in ten minutes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Children cooperate more when caregivers explain rules because the reasons feel fair and understandable.
   - Bedtime routines are important because regular sleep supports healthy development.

1. **Linking Word**: so (type: coordinating connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Therefore; as a result; introduces a result or consequence.
   - *Function*: Connects a reason to a practical outcome, often when parents describe what will happen next.
   
   **Synonyms**: therefore, as a result, that’s why, consequently
   
   **Antonyms**: however, but, yet (contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Explaining natural or planned consequences of behavior ("You’re tired, so we’ll stay home.", "You threw the toy, so I put it away.").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal writing (prefer "therefore" or "as a result"), or when no real cause-effect relationship exists.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [reason], so [result] OR [situation]. So [result].
   - **Position**: mid-sentence or beginning of a new sentence
   - **Punctuation**: comma before "so" when linking two full clauses
   - **Common errors to avoid**: stringing too many clauses together; using "so" without clearly stated reason.
   
   **Root Analysis**: from Old English word meaning "in this way, therefore".
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *swa* → "so"; has long been used to show results and logical moves in speech.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You didn’t nap, so you’re extra grumpy tonight.
   - We’ve already watched two episodes, so the TV is going off now.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Parents often link behavior and outcomes verbally ("You did X, so Y happens") to make consequences clearer.
   - When explanations are consistent, children learn that actions lead to results, and so they can predict what will happen.

1. **Linking Word**: if (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - On the condition that; introduces a possible situation and its consequence.
   - *Function*: Creates rules, agreements, and conditional consequences in parenting.
   
   **Synonyms**: provided that, as long as, on condition that
   
   **Antonyms**: even if, whether or not (removing condition)
   
   **When to Use**: Setting clear conditions ("If you finish homework, you can play"), warning about consequences ("If you run, you might fall").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When something will happen regardless of conditions; avoid using unclear or unrealistic "if" conditions that confuse children.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: If [condition], [result] OR [result] if [condition]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Punctuation**: comma after the "if" clause when it comes first
   - **Common errors to avoid**: piling up too many conditions, using threats you cannot or will not follow through on.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple subordinating conjunction from early Germanic roots.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *gif* meaning "if, whether"; now central in expressing conditions in everyday parenting language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you clean up now, we’ll have time for a story.
   - You can go outside if you stay in the yard.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Conditional statements such as "If you do X, then Y" help children understand predictable consequences.
   - Parents are encouraged to use realistic "if" statements and follow through on them.

1. **Linking Word**: when (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At the time that; whenever; introduces a time-based condition or trigger.
   - *Function*: Links routines, triggers, and emotional reactions in parenting situations.
   
   **Synonyms**: whenever, once (for a point in time), as soon as (immediate timing)
   
   **Antonyms**: before, after (different temporal relations)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing routines ("When we get home, you wash your hands"), emotional patterns ("When you’re tired, you get cranky").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For strict conditions where timing is less important than the action itself (use "if"), or when you mean "although" or "whereas".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: When [time/trigger], [routine/result] OR [result] when [time/trigger]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Punctuation**: comma after initial "when" clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: confusing "when" (time) with "if" (condition) in rules.
   
   **Root Analysis**: from Old English interrogative/relative word for time.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *hwænne* → "when"; used both in questions ("When?") and time clauses.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - When you finish dinner, you can have dessert.
   - You always get silly when you’re overtired.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Clear "when"-based routines ("When we arrive home, you hang up your coat") help children know what is expected.
   - Children often show stronger emotional reactions when they lack predictable "when" cues in daily life.

1. **Linking Word**: otherwise (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - If not; in the opposite case; introduces a warning about what will happen if a rule or condition is not followed.
   - *Function*: Connects a condition or instruction to a negative consequence or problem.
   
   **Synonyms**: or else, if not, in other circumstances
   
   **Antonyms**: instead, on the other hand (different contrastive uses)
   
   **When to Use**: Warning children gently about consequences ("We need to leave now, otherwise we’ll be late"), explaining why rules matter.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: As a threat word combined with vague, scary outcomes ("Do it, otherwise..."); especially unhelpful if the consequence is never explained.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Instruction]. Otherwise, [negative consequence]. OR [Condition]; otherwise, [consequence].
   - **Position**: usually sentence-initial in the second sentence or after a semicolon
   - **Punctuation**: period or semicolon before; comma after "otherwise"
   - **Common errors to avoid**: using "otherwise" without stating the actual consequence; overusing as a threat.
   
   **Root Analysis**: other + wise (in that manner).
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English and Middle English forms meaning "in a different way"; now commonly used to signal alternative or negative outcomes.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Hurry up, otherwise we’ll miss the bus.
   - You need to brush your teeth, otherwise they’ll get cavities.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Stating clear, realistic consequences ("Do X; otherwise, Y will happen") helps children understand why rules exist.
   - "Otherwise" is useful in parenting explanations when paired with concrete, non-threatening outcomes.
