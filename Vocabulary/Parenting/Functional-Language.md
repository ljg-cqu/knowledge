1. **Functional Expression**: Can you please + VERB...? (function: requesting cooperation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite question pattern used by caregivers to ask children to do something (tidy up, get dressed, help, come here).

   **Synonyms**: Could you please...?, Would you mind...?, I’d like you to..., I need you to...
   
   **Antonyms**: Don’t do..., Stop..., You must not... (prohibitions)
   
   **When to Use**: Everyday parenting instructions where you want the child to cooperate willingly—chores, routines, small requests.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - Can you please tidy your toys?
   - Can you please put on your shoes?
   - Can you please use your quiet voice?
