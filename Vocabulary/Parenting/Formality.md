   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use more formal language with other adults or in written rules; casual/empathetic with your own children.
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers’ children or students often need semi-formal language; close family allows casual or humorous tone.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Genuine safety or bullying issues call for clear, firm language; minor loudness allows lighter, humorous reminders.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect very direct commands from parents; others prefer softer, respectful requests.
   - *Medium*: Spoken reminders can be casual or empathetic; written school policies should be semi-formal or formal.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Shouting "SHUT UP!" at a child—harmful and disrespectful, damages trust.
   - Using only vague hints ("It’s a bit noisy") when the child needs a clear, simple instruction.
   - Staying purely formal with very young children, making the message hard for them to understand emotionally.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, strong commands from parents ("Be quiet!") are normal and not seen as rude; in others, parents actively avoid harsh commands and prefer cooperative language.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Your child is shouting at a sibling → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic ("I can hear you’re angry, but shouting won’t fix it—tell me what happened.")
   - **Situation 2**: Children are too loud in a library play area → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("I need you to lower your voices now.")
   - **Situation 3**: School handbook rule → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("Students should refrain from raising their voices in shared spaces.")

   - *Social Distance*: Close family can lean on humorous or lively language; distant relatives or caregivers may stay semi-formal.

   - *Medium*: Chore charts or written agreements sound better in semi-formal or formal style.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Insulting the child ("You’re disgusting") instead of criticising the behavior; harms self-esteem.
   - Giving vague orders ("Do something about this") that a child doesn’t know how to follow.
   - Only using angry commands, which may create power struggles rather than long-term habits.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Expectations about children’s personal space vary widely; in some cultures, parents clean children’s rooms for a long time, while in others, independence is expected early.
   
   **Context Examples**:

   - *Social Distance*: Babysitters or teachers may choose semi-formal refusals; parents may mix casual, lively, or empathetic forms.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If overuse of screens is causing sleep or behavior problems, clearer, firmer versions are needed; occasional extra time may allow softer negotiation.
   - *Cultural Context*: Different families and cultures have very different screen norms; some expect strict rules, others emphasize flexibility.
   - *Medium*: Written screen-time agreements between parents and teenagers should use semi-formal or formal style.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "no" very harshly without explanation ("Because I said so!")—may increase resistance.
   - Giving in after repeated begging; teaches children that pushing the limit will eventually work.
   - Using sarcasm that the child cannot understand, which can feel hurtful.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Screen-time concerns are global but shaped by local schooling, housing, and family patterns; in some places, screens are central to social life, in others they are heavily restricted.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Everyday limit at home → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("No, we’re finished with screen time for now.")
   - **Situation 2**: Child is very upset → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic ("I know you really want more, but we agreed on this limit.")
