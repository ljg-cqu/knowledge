1. **Expression**: quality time (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Time spent with a child that is focused, attentive, and emotionally connected, rather than just being physically present.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common partnership in parenting and family contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: focused time together, one-on-one time, dedicated time, meaningful time
   
   **Antonyms**: distracted time, rushed time, background time, low-quality time
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about making space in a busy schedule to really connect with children (no phones, shared activities, active listening).

   **Common Variations**: 
   - spend quality time
   - quality time with the kids
   - carve out quality time
   - quality family time
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Quality" (degree of excellence) naturally pairs with "time" to highlight that not all time is equal—what matters is attention and emotional connection, which is central in parenting discussions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: quality (Latin *qualitas* = kind, nature) + time (Old English = period, duration)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I try to spend some quality time with each kid before bed.
   - Weekends are our chance for real quality time as a family.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: cooling-off period, short break, temporary separation, behavior break
   
   **Antonyms**: physical punishment, yelling match, endless lecture, ignoring behavior
   
   **When to Use**: Describing a structured, short break from activity after misbehavior, usually with clear rules and a calm explanation.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - give a time-out
   - put a child in time-out
   - time-out corner/chair
   - brief time-out
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Time" plus "out" expresses the idea of stepping out of normal activity for a short period, which matches the parenting technique of pausing interaction to reset behavior.
   
   **Root Analysis**: time (period, duration) + out (away from activity or play)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you keep hitting, you’ll need a time-out to calm down.
   - We use very short time-outs instead of yelling.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - practice attachment parenting
   - attachment parenting philosophy
   - attachment parenting methods
   - attachment parenting community
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Attachment" refers to emotional bonds in psychology, and "parenting" specifies the practices built around strengthening that bond.
   
   **Root Analysis**: attachment (emotional bond) + parenting (process of raising children)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We follow attachment parenting, so we try to respond quickly when the baby cries.
   - Attachment parenting works for us, but it’s not for everyone.

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Helicopter" evokes an image of something hovering overhead, constantly watching; when paired with "parent" it vividly captures overinvolvement.
   
   **Root Analysis**: helicopter (aircraft that hovers) + parent (caregiver)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’m trying not to be a helicopter parent, but it’s hard to let go.
   - Teachers sometimes complain about helicopter parents who email them every day.

   **Root Analysis**: positive (adding something) + reinforcement (strengthening, supporting)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We’re trying more positive reinforcement, like stickers when they get ready on time.
   - Instead of yelling, I use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior.

   **Root Analysis**: work (paid employment or effort) + life (personal time, relationships) + balance (even distribution)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
