   **Root Analysis**: re- (again, back) + ly (from Old French *lier*, to bind) + on (preposition marking the thing you lean on)
   
   **Etymology**: Old French/Latin → from Old French *relyer* "to bind fast," from Latin *religare* (re- "back" + *ligare* "to tie"). In English, the sense shifted to "trust" or "place confidence in," strongly linked to depending on something indispensable.

   **Etymology**: Latin → from *requirere* "to seek, need, demand," from *re-* (again) + *quaerere* (to seek). Through Old French *requerre* into Middle English, keeping the sense of treating something as necessary.
