1. **Preposition**: without (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Not having something present in a place or situation (rare in strict spatial sense).
   - *(Temporal)* During a period when something is absent ("years without rest").
   - *(Abstract)* In the absence of something that is needed or expected; not using or receiving something that may be indispensable ("without support," "without permission").
   
   **Synonyms**: lacking (in contexts like "lacking support"), in the absence of, minus (informal for quantities)
   
   **Antonyms**: with, accompanied by, supported by
   
   **When to Use**: To highlight what is missing and often indispensable ("without trust, the team falls apart","without power, the service shuts down"). Very common when stressing dependence or necessity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal mathematical or programming language where more precise terms like "excluding" or symbols (−) are expected; also avoid overusing it when a positive form with "with" or "using" is clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: without help, without warning, without fail, without question
   - **Verb + prep**: work without, survive without, manage without, continue without
   - **Adjective + prep**: indispensable without? (uncommon), impossible without
   - **Noun + prep**: life without, progress without, success without
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (together) + out (outside, beyond) → "on the outside of having something"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *wiþutan* "outside of," from *wiþ* (against, with) + *utan* (outside). The sense of lacking an indispensable thing is now central in everyday use.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I honestly can’t imagine working without this tool now.
   - Without coffee, my mornings move in slow motion.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Without clear priorities, even highly capable teams struggle to deliver consistently.
   - Many critical services cannot operate safely without multiple layers of redundancy.

1. **Preposition**: for (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Rarely, in front of something (archaic/poetic).
   - *(Temporal)* For a period of time ("for years").
   - *(Abstract)* Used to show purpose, benefit, or required condition ("for the system to work," "for safety reasons"), often pointing to what is indispensable for a desired result.
   
   **Synonyms**: in order to (for purpose), in the interest of, on behalf of (different nuance)
   
   **Antonyms**: against (opposition), despite (contrast), without (absence)
   
   **When to Use**: To link what is necessary with its goal or beneficiary ("for reliability, backups are indispensable","for this plan to succeed, we need your support").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In clauses where a bare infinitive or "to"-infinitive is required instead of "for" (e.g., "it is necessary to do this," not "necessary for do this").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: for safety, for success, for stability, for survival
   - **Verb + prep**: plan for, prepare for, provide for, care for
   - **Adjective + prep**: essential for, vital for, necessary for, responsible for
   - **Noun + prep**: requirement for, condition for, foundation for
   
   **Root Analysis**: Proto-Germanic *fur* (before, in front of) with meanings extending to benefit and purpose
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *for* meaning "in front of, on account of, because of." Over time, the purpose/benefit sense became central, especially in expressions of what is needed for something.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Good Wi‑Fi is a must for working from home.
   - For this recipe to work, patience is just as important as the ingredients.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Preposition**: on (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Touching and supported by a surface ("on the table").
   - *(Temporal)* On a particular day or date ("on Monday").
   - *(Abstract)* Used in patterns like "depend on," "rely on," "build on," showing that something rests on or is supported by an indispensable base.
   
   **Synonyms**: based on (in abstract support), resting on, built on
   
   **Antonyms**: independent of, separate from, off (spatially)
   
   **When to Use**: To highlight what something "sits on" conceptually—its necessary foundation ("the plan hinges on one assumption","we rely on accurate data").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In more literal contexts where another preposition is required (e.g., "in" a team, "at" a company). Also avoid repeating "on" awkwardly in long chains.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: on top of, on the basis of, on condition of
   - **Verb + prep**: depend on, rely on, build on, base on, count on
   - **Adjective + prep**: dependent on, reliant on, contingent on
   - **Noun + prep**: reliance on, dependence on, emphasis on
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old Germanic root indicating contact and support; closely linked with the idea of resting or being supported by something.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *on* meaning "on, in, into," related to other Germanic prepositions. Its abstract use in patterns like "depend on" turned physical support into a metaphor for indispensability.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - These days I lean heavily on my calendar to stay organized.
   - The whole plan is riding on one key decision.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The system is heavily dependent on a small set of indispensable services.
   - Our conclusions rest on assumptions that must be examined carefully.
