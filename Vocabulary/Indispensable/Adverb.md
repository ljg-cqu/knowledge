1. **Adverb**: absolutely (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to emphasize that something is completely or totally the case, often strengthening adjectives like "essential," "indispensable," or "vital."

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - absolutely essential
   - absolutely indispensable
   - absolutely necessary
   - absolutely cannot
   - absolutely right
   
   **Root Analysis**: ab- (away, from) + solut- (loosened, set free) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from *absolutus* "complete, unrestricted," via Old French into English. The meaning shifted to expressing completeness or totality, making it a natural intensifier for indispensable things.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: fundamentally, basically, at heart, in essence, in substance
   
   **Antonyms**: superficially, apparently, loosely, roughly (when stressing non-essential view)
   
   **When to Use**: When summarizing the key, indispensable point of something while acknowledging that reality may be more detailed ("essentially, we depend on one key system"). Common in explanations and summaries.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Where precision is more important than simplification (technical proofs, detailed legal wording), or when the simplification might hide critical risks.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - essentially the same
   - essentially depends on
   - essentially about
   - essentially true
   - essentially, what this means is
   
   **Root Analysis**: essent- (being, essence) + -ial (relating to) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin/English → built on "essence" and "essential," referring to what belongs to the core nature of something. As an adverb, it signals focus on indispensable aspects.

   - critically important
   - critically dependent on
   - critically needed
   - critically short of
   - critically endangered (in extended use)
