1. **Linking Word**: unless (type: subordinating)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces an exception or negative condition, meaning "if not"; shows that something is indispensable for a result to happen.
   - *Function*: Marks a necessary condition by stating what will happen if that condition is not met.
   
   **Synonyms**: if not, except if, except in the case that
   
   **Antonyms**: provided that, as long as (positive condition), once (simple condition)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to stress that a requirement is non-negotiable ("We won’t ship unless the tests pass"). Useful for clear boundary-setting, rules, and risk statements.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal legal or technical language where "if and only if" or explicit logical forms are required; also avoid double negatives that make the condition hard to understand.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [main clause] + unless + [condition]
   - Position: typically mid-sentence, but can start a sentence ("Unless this is done, …").
   - Punctuation: comma after the clause if "unless" comes first; no comma if it comes in the middle in short sentences.
   - Common errors to avoid: using "unless" with a negative verb ("unless we don’t"), which creates confusion.
   
   **Root Analysis**: un- (not) + less (except) → "not except if"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from "on lesse" meaning "on a less condition," evolving into a single word. Now used widely to express indispensable conditions.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We’re not leaving unless everyone’s ready.
   - I can’t help you unless you tell me what you really need.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The release will not proceed unless all critical checks have passed.
   - Funding will not be approved unless the proposal clearly identifies the indispensable dependencies.

1. **Linking Word**: otherwise (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to talk about what will happen if the previous condition is not met; expresses a negative or undesirable alternative.
   - *Function*: Signals a consequence that makes the prior action or condition feel indispensable ("do X, otherwise Y will happen").
   
   **Synonyms**: or else, if not, failing that, in any other case
   
   **Antonyms**: therefore, as a result (positive consequence), instead (alternative without strong threat)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to warn about what happens if a necessary action is not taken ("We need backup copies; otherwise, we risk losing everything"). Strong in instructions and advice.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For neutral contrasts or alternatives where "instead" or "on the other hand" is more appropriate; also avoid using it too often in very formal text where explicit conditional clauses may be clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Do X]; otherwise, [negative consequence].
   - [Statement]. Otherwise, [different situation].
   - Position: usually sentence-initial in the second clause, often after a semicolon or full stop.
   - Punctuation: often preceded by a semicolon or period; followed by a comma in many styles.
   
   **Root Analysis**: other (different) + wise (manner, way) → "in a different way/condition"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *oþer* (other) + *wise* (manner), originally meaning "in another way." The idea of a worse alternative made it a natural marker of indispensable conditions.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Make sure you save your work; otherwise, you might lose everything.
   - Bring a jacket; otherwise you’ll freeze out there.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The system must validate input strictly; otherwise, critical security vulnerabilities may be introduced.
   - Clear ownership must be established; otherwise, indispensable tasks will fall through the cracks.

1. **Linking Word**: only if (type: subordinating)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a strict condition that must be fulfilled before something else can happen; stronger than simple "if."
   - *Function*: Emphasizes that the condition is indispensable and not optional.
   
   **Synonyms**: provided that (slightly softer), on condition that, and only in the case that
   
   **Antonyms**: even if (ignores condition), whether or not (independent of condition)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to draw a firm boundary around a non-negotiable requirement ("We deploy only if all tests pass"). Good for policies, agreements, and safety rules.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In everyday speech when a simple "if" is enough; overusing "only if" can sound rigid or complicated if the stakes are low.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [main clause] + only if + [condition]
   - only if + [condition], + [main clause] (less common, inversion possible: "Only if X will Y happen").
   - Punctuation: comma when the "only if" clause comes first; careful with word order in formal writing.
   - Common errors to avoid: confusing cause and condition ("only if" states a requirement, not the result).
   
   **Root Analysis**: only (no more than, and nothing else) + if (conditional marker)
   
   **Etymology**: English → built from everyday words "only" and "if." Its combined use arose naturally to underline indispensable conditions.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’ll join the trip only if I can get the time off work.
   - We’ll buy this gadget only if we really can’t do without it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Access is granted only if multi-factor authentication is successfully completed.
   - The project should proceed only if the indispensable risks have been clearly identified and mitigated.
