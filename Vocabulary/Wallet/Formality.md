# Extract Formality Variants for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract expressions (words, phrases, sentences) from the source text about **Wallet** and generate equivalent variants across formality registers to help learners understand appropriate language choices for different contexts.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one communicative intent or expression, providing multiple variants across formality levels (Casual, Semi-Formal, Formal) and stylistic registers (Humorous, Lively, Empathetic) with comprehensive context guidance.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify expressions where register choice significantly impacts appropriateness and effectiveness
- Prioritize: expressions with clear register sensitivity, professional/social interactions, opinions/requests/refusals, descriptive language
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact communicative intents)
- Do not skip sections; cover both explicit statements and implicit communicative functions

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all variants in realistic, natural language usage
- Never create artificial or unnatural expressions
- Ensure semantic equivalence across variants—same core meaning, different register
- Derive context sensitivity from actual usage patterns

**Focus:**
- Expressions with significant register variation (casual ↔ formal spectrum)
- Professional communication needs (emails, meetings, presentations, reports)
- Social interaction patterns (requests, refusals, agreements, disagreements, opinions)
- Tone modulation (neutral ↔ humorous ↔ lively ↔ empathetic)
- Cross-cultural formality expectations
- Common learner errors in register selection

**Format:**
- **Original Expression**: [expression from source] (context: [brief description])
- **Core Intent**: Simple statement of what the speaker wants to communicate
- **Casual**: Natural informal variant (friends, close colleagues, relaxed settings)
- **Semi-Formal**: Neutral professional variant (general workplace, polite strangers, standard business)
- **Formal**: Academic/official variant (authority figures, legal contexts, academic writing, ceremonies)
- **Humorous**: Engaging playful variant (appropriate humor, rapport-building)
- **Lively**: Energetic expressive variant (enthusiasm, engagement, storytelling)
- **Empathetic**: Emotionally attuned variant (support, understanding, emotional validation)
- **Register Selection Guide**: Decision criteria for choosing appropriate formality level
- **Common Mistakes**: Typical errors learners make with this expression type
- **Cultural Notes**: Cross-cultural formality expectations (if applicable)
- **Context Examples**: 3-4 specific situations showing appropriate variant selection
