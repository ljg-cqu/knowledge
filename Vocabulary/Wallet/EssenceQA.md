## Q1: Designing a basic “Wallet & Money” lesson

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher planning an A2-level Wallet & Money lesson  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Teacher, Students] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You teach an A2 adult ESL class. The draft “Wallet & Money” unit proposes over 40 new items: wallet, purse, cardholder, debit card, credit card, prepaid card, membership card, ID card, cash, banknote, coin, change, loyalty points, cashback, QR code, contactless, NFC, CVV, overdraft, credit limit, mobile wallet, crypto wallet, seed phrase, and more.  
You have only one 45-minute lesson before students do a short speaking task describing how they usually pay in shops and online. Previous classes complained that “there are too many words” and then used only money, card, phone in real tasks.  
Your coordinator asks you to keep just **10–12 truly essential concepts** for the core lesson and move the rest to optional extension.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your reduced word list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what you will consciously de-prioritize or ignore** in this lesson, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core objects and money forms (wallet, cash, coins, card).  
  - Everyday payment methods (pay in cash, pay by card, pay by phone / mobile wallet).  
  - Basic card and security words (debit card vs credit card, PIN, receipt).  
  - One or two “modern” concepts that show change (contactless, mobile wallet).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Things you carry*: wallet/purse, cash, coins, debit/credit card, ID card.  
  - *How you pay*: pay in cash, pay by card, pay by phone/contactless; simple patterns like “tap your card/phone”.  
  - *Safety & proof*: PIN, receipt, ID (light touch only).  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which 10–12 words enter the core: they support the speaking task “How do you usually pay?” and real life. Terms like NFC, CVV, credit limit, seed phrase, and crypto wallet move to later units because they are lower-frequency and harder to use in A2 conversations.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize “things you carry” then “how you pay”. Success metric: in a short role-play, ≥80% of learners correctly use at least three target items (wallet/card/cash + one payment verb).  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to cover all 40+ words; spending time on rare technical items instead of high-frequency basics.

## Q2: Clarifying onboarding language for a mobile wallet app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: UX writer for a mobile wallet onboarding flow  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [UX Writer, PM, Compliance, Support] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are rewriting the onboarding screens for a mobile wallet app. Current copy mixes user-friendly phrases (“add your card”, “pay with your phone”) with technical ones (“tokenize your PAN”, “provision your credential”, “funding instrument”, “settlement account”).  
Usability tests show that new users get stuck on steps labeled with heavy jargon, and support tickets complain “I don’t understand what this screen wants me to do.” Compliance, however, insists that some precise terms must appear at least once.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should structure the vocabulary of the onboarding flow.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain how each cluster **drives concrete wording decisions** in the UI.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday actions the user must take (add a card, top up, verify identity).  
  - Clear money movement terms (add money, move money, pay, get a refund).  
  - Simple safety vocabulary (PIN, code, security check) with minimal technical terms.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Core actions*: “Add your card”, “Add money to your wallet”, “Pay with your phone” (verbs first, no hidden jargon).  
  - *Safety & checks*: “Confirm with your PIN”, “We’ll send you a one-time code” instead of “2FA” and “provisioning credentials”.  
  - *Legal fine print*: a small area where required terms like “payment instrument” appear with a short plain-English gloss.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which words appear in big buttons and headings (plain verbs) vs in small print (technical labels). You deliberately remove or hide phrases like “tokenize your PAN” from main steps.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize *Core actions* then *Safety & checks*. Metrics: completion rate of onboarding, number of tickets tagged “don’t understand this step”.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting compliance language leak into main button text; using different verbs (“add”, “link”, “provision”) for the same action.

## Q3: Training support staff for lost wallet and card calls

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Customer support lead creating language guidelines  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Support Agent, Customer, Bank/Fintech] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You lead a small team that answers calls and chats about lost wallets, stolen cards, and suspicious payments. Internal documents list many technical terms: block card, freeze account, dispute transaction, chargeback, card reissue, KYC, suspicious activity report, fraud monitoring, 2FA reset, device binding.  
New agents feel overwhelmed by vocabulary and either oversimplify (“we will close everything”) or copy technical phrases that scare customers. Call duration is rising, and some customers leave the call unsure what will actually happen to their money and cards.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape the vocabulary agents use on the phone or in chat.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to improve clarity and risk handling.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clear verbs for protective actions (block the card, freeze the account, lock the app).  
  - Plain descriptions of money status (your current balance, pending payments, refunds).  
  - Next-step language (we will send you a new card, you need to change your PIN).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Immediate protection*: “We’ll block your card now”, “We’ll lock your wallet app on this phone” – simple verbs instead of “deactivate instrument”.  
  - *Money picture*: phrases like “this payment is pending / completed / reversed” rather than internal codes.  
  - *Follow-up steps*: “We will send a new card”, “Please choose a new PIN” – concrete future actions.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive training scripts and templates so agents use a small, consistent word set that both lowers risk and calms customers. Technical terms like “chargeback” remain internal.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize *Immediate protection* language first. Metrics: first-contact resolution, average handling time, % of QA forms where the “customer understood next steps” box is ticked.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Mixing internal jargon with customer language; failing to separate “what we do now” from “what happens to your money later”.

## Q4: Scoping vocabulary for a “Wallet” module in a language app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Product manager for an English vocabulary-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [PM, Curriculum Designer, Engineer, Learners] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are defining the “Wallet & Payments” module of an English vocabulary app. Content designers propose 250+ items: everyday money words (wallet, cash, coins, change), dozens of card types, banking terms (overdraft, standing order), fintech buzzwords (super app, buy now pay later), and crypto jargon (on-chain, seed phrase, cold wallet).  
Engineering can only support **60–80 core cards** in version 1. Marketing wants “fun crypto words”, while curriculum designers argue for solid basics like debit card, pay in cash, pay by card, receipt.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should define the module’s scope.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map to learning paths.  
3. State clearly what you will **exclude or push to later** and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday wallet objects and money (wallet, cash, coins, card, ID).  
  - Core payment actions (pay in cash/by card/by phone, tap, swipe, scan).  
  - Basic safety and problem language (PIN, card declined, block card, lost wallet).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Essentials you carry*: wallet, cash, coins, debit/credit card, ID card.  
  - *How you pay*: core verbs and phrases for in-shop and online payments.  
  - *Staying safe*: small set of security/problem phrases for real-life trouble.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which ~60–80 items ship: mostly high-frequency everyday terms, with a few simple digital wallet phrases. Advanced banking and crypto jargon (on-chain, seed phrase, super app) moves to later “Advanced finance” or “Crypto basics” packs.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize *Essentials you carry* and *How you pay* first. Metrics: learner retention of target items and ability to complete role-plays like “paying in a shop” using at least three core phrases.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting “cool” rare words crowd out basics; mixing too many domains (banking, crypto, corporate finance) into one beginner module.

## Q5: Explaining crypto wallets to beginners

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Content lead writing a “What is a crypto wallet?” help page  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Content Lead, Compliance, Beginners, Support] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You must write a short help article titled “What is a crypto wallet?” for absolute beginners. Existing drafts mix many terms: non-custodial wallet, seed phrase, private key, public address, exchange wallet, hardware wallet, gas fees, signing a transaction, blockchain explorer.  
User research shows that new users confuse “wallet”, “account”, and “exchange”, and some think the company can always recover their money even if they lose everything. Compliance insists that you clearly explain risks without scaring people away.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that must be explained in simple wallet vocabulary.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **1–3 simple metrics** and a priority order to check whether the article works.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Wallet as a container for keys and balances (not the coins themselves).  
  - Who controls the wallet: company (custodial/exchange wallet) vs user (non-custodial wallet).  
  - One safety concept: seed phrase / recovery phrase that must be protected.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *What a crypto wallet is*: plain-language definition comparing it to a bank app or physical wallet, plus “address” as where you can receive money.  
  - *Who controls it*: simple contrast between “we keep the keys for you” vs “only you have the keys; we cannot restore them”.  
  - *How to stay safe*: seed/recovery phrase, basic rules (“never share this phrase”, “store it offline”).  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which vocabulary appears in headings and examples. Technical extras like gas fees or blockchain explorer are out of scope for this article. The goal is that a beginner can answer “What is a crypto wallet?” and “What must I never lose or share?”.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize *What a wallet is* then *Who controls it* then *How to stay safe*. Metrics: reduced support tickets like “I lost my seed phrase, can you recover my coins?”, and comprehension-test accuracy on two or three simple questions.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Diving into transaction mechanics instead of control and safety; introducing too many new crypto terms in one short article.
