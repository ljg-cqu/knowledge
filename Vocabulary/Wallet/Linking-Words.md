# Extract Linking Words & Discourse Markers for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract linking words (conjunctions, connectors, discourse markers, transition expressions) that are essential for constructing complex sentences and expressing logical relationships from the source text about **Wallet**.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one linking word or discourse marker with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, grammatical function, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all linking words that connect clauses, phrases, words, or ideas
- Prioritize: subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, correlative pairs, logical connectors, discourse markers, transition phrases
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact linking expressions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both grammatical conjunctions and discourse-level connectors

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in linking words actually present in source
- Never invent linking words not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- **Coordinating conjunctions** (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
- **Subordinating conjunctions** (because, although, if, when, while, since, etc.)
- **Correlative conjunctions** (either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also)
- **Logical connectors** (cause/effect, contrast, addition, sequence)
- **Discourse markers** (organize discourse, signal shifts, manage turns)
- **Transition phrases** (between topics, ideas, paragraphs)
- **Cohesive devices** (reference, substitution markers)

**Format:**
- **Linking Word**: [word/phrase] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative/connector/discourse marker)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain grammatical or discourse function clearly*
  - *Describe logical relationship created*
  - *Include clause patterns and register information*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative linking words with same function
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 linking words expressing opposite logical relationship (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or registers where this linking word is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this linking word would be inappropriate or create grammatical/logical errors
- **Common Patterns**: Grammatical structures, punctuation rules, sentence positions
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (if applicable)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Linking Word**: [word/phrase] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative/connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - [Collins-style definition]
   - *Function*: [grammatical/discourse function and logical relationship]
   
   **Synonyms**: [word1], [word2], [word3]...
   
   **Antonyms**: [opposite-function word1], [word2]... (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: [Context description - sentence complexity, logical relationships, formality, text type]
   
   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - grammatical errors, wrong logical relationship, incorrect register, overuse]
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + [linking word] + [independent/dependent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial / mid-sentence / sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: comma rules, semicolon patterns
   - [Common errors to avoid]: fragments, comma splices, logical inconsistencies
   
   **Root Analysis**: [components] + [meanings] (if applicable)
   
   **Etymology**: [Origin language] → [historical development] (brief)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Natural conversational example 1]
   - [Natural conversational example 2]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - [Academic/professional example 1]
   - [Academic/professional example 2]

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on linking words that are essential for complex sentences and coherent communication about **Wallet**
- Prioritize linking words with learning value (subordinating conjunctions, formal connectors, subtle distinctions)
- Clearly indicate grammatical patterns, punctuation rules, and register restrictions
- Distinguish between grammatical conjunctions (sentence-level) and discourse markers (text-level)
