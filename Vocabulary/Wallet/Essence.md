1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Wallet vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: Provide an 80/20 set of English words and expressions for talking about wallets in real life: what a wallet is, what goes inside it, how people pay with it (offline and online), and how they protect the money and information it holds.
   - **Scope**: Focus on high‑leverage vocabulary for physical wallets, mobile/digital wallets, and simple crypto wallet talk in everyday situations (shopping, travel, online payment, basic security). Excludes detailed banking law, deep blockchain engineering, and specialist finance or accounting jargon.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - If a learner can only master 20–40 words and phrases about wallets and payments, which ones matter most for daily communication?
     - How do you describe your wallet, what you carry, and how you pay in shops, online, and when travelling?
     - How do you explain basic digital wallet actions (add a card, top up, transfer money, pay by phone) in clear, simple English?
     - How do you talk about losing a wallet, card security, and protecting money or keys without heavy technical language?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Part of speech & function**: nouns (wallet, card, cash, coin, ID, balance), verbs/phrases (pay, tap, swipe, top up, transfer, block a card), adjectives/adverbs (contactless, secure, broke, cashless).
     - **Context**: everyday shopping and bills, online shopping and apps, travel and paying abroad, crypto / virtual assets.
     - **Wallet type & control**: physical wallet, mobile/digital wallet, crypto wallet; personal vs shared/business use; custodial vs non‑custodial (who controls the money/keys).
     - **Register & tone**: casual talk with friends ("my wallet's empty"), neutral service talk ("pay by card"), formal/technical language in banking, fintech, and security guidance ("digital wallet service", "electronic payment instrument").

1. Q: Essence card – Core wallet types and roles
   A:
   - **Label**: Core wallet types and roles
   - **Core Idea**: Most real conversations use a small set of wallet types and roles: a physical wallet you carry, a mobile/digital wallet on your phone, and (for some users) a crypto wallet. All are containers that hold money, cards, or keys and act as tools for paying and proving identity.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without clear words for these few wallet types, learners talk around the idea ("money app", "that thing on my phone") and struggle to explain how they pay, move money, or store crypto safely.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: wallet type & control = physical / digital / crypto; context = everyday spending vs online/fintech vs crypto.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - wallet
     - mobile wallet
     - crypto wallet

1. Q: Essence card – What lives inside a wallet
   A:
   - **Label**: What lives inside a wallet
   - **Core Idea**: A small group of nouns lets you describe what a wallet holds: cash and coins, cards (debit, credit, travel, transit), ID (ID card, driver’s licence), and small paper items like receipts and tickets.
   - **Why It Matters**: These words are basic for real‑life tasks such as describing a lost wallet, checking what to bring when you go out, asking for the right replacement, or filling forms that ask what ID or cards you have.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: part of speech & function = nouns; context = home, shopping, travel, banking.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - cash / coins
     - debit card / credit card
     - ID (ID card, driver’s licence)

1. Q: Essence card – Everyday wallet actions and payment patterns
   A:
   - **Label**: Everyday wallet actions and payment patterns
   - **Core Idea**: A core set of verbs and patterns describe how people actually use wallets: pay in cash, pay by card, tap/swipe, scan a QR code, top up a wallet, transfer money, link a card, split the bill.
   - **Why It Matters**: These patterns appear in everyday conversations, app instructions, and customer support. Without them, learners can name objects (wallet, card) but cannot explain what they are doing with their money or what an app is asking them to do.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: part of speech & function = verbs and multi‑word expressions; context = in‑person vs online payments; time focus = before / during / after payment.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - pay in cash / pay by card
     - tap / swipe / scan
     - top up (a wallet)

1. Q: Essence card – Security, loss, and recovery language
   A:
   - **Label**: Security, loss, and recovery language
   - **Core Idea**: A small security vocabulary lets you talk about problems and protection: lose your wallet, block or freeze a card, lock your phone, report a card stolen, reset your PIN, two‑factor authentication, backup or recovery phrase (for crypto).
   - **Why It Matters**: In emergencies (lost wallet, suspicious payment, stolen phone) people need clear, polite language fast. Using the right words makes help calls, app flows, and security advice much more effective and reduces real‑world risk.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: context = security and support; wallet type & control = bank / app / crypto; register = neutral to formal.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - block / freeze a card
     - security code / PIN
     - recovery phrase / seed phrase

1. Q: Essence card – Casual money talk vs formal payment language
   A:
   - **Label**: Casual money talk vs formal payment language
   - **Core Idea**: The same situation can be described casually ("my wallet’s empty", "I’m broke") or in neutral/formal terms ("insufficient funds", "low balance", "your card was declined"). Wallet vocabulary changes with relationship, setting, and seriousness.
   - **Why It Matters**: Learners must switch register when moving between friends, shop staff, bank support, and fintech apps. Using the wrong tone can sound rude, unprofessional, or confusing, even when the basic words are correct.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: register & tone = casual / neutral / formal; context = social talk vs customer service vs official messages.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - broke / out of cash
     - low balance / insufficient funds
     - card declined
