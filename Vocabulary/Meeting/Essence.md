1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Meeting*, capture the small set of ideas that define meetings as deliberate, structured shared time used to inform, decide, create, and maintain working relationships.
   - **Scope**: Covers everyday and professional meetings (1:1s, small-team and cross-functional sessions, study/learning meetings) where people gather at a scheduled time with a clear purpose. Excludes large conferences, purely social gatherings, and fully asynchronous collaboration (email, chat, docs) except where they support or replace meetings.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What makes a gathering count as a "meeting" instead of just unstructured talk?
     - What few purposes justify a meeting versus handling the same work asynchronously?
     - Which elements most strongly determine whether a meeting produces clear decisions and follow-through instead of waste?
     - How do meetings fit into the wider system of communication, documentation, and execution?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Purpose**: Inform / Decide / Create / Relate.
     - **Cadence & Time Horizon**: One-off vs recurring; operational / tactical / strategic.
     - **Format & Channel**: In-person / remote / hybrid; synchronous vs async-supported.
     - **Participation & Roles**: Size, decision-maker vs contributors, facilitator, note-taker.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Meeting*: A scheduled block of shared time where specific people gather with a clear purpose and expected outcomes.
     - *Agenda*: A short, ordered list of topics and intended outcomes that shapes what the meeting time is used for.
     - *Facilitator*: The person responsible for guiding the meeting process so that time, attention, and participation are used well.
     - *Participant*: Someone who is expected to contribute information, perspectives, or decisions in the meeting.
     - *Decision*: A clear choice among options that commits people to a direction.
     - *Action item*: A specific follow-up task with an owner and (ideally) a deadline that flows from the meeting.
     - *Minutes / Notes*: A brief written record of key decisions, action items, and context from the meeting.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Communication, Collaboration, Organization, Time Management.

1. Q: Essence card – Meeting as purposeful shared time
   A:
   - **Label**: Meeting as purposeful shared time
   - **Core Idea**: A meeting is not just "people talking"; it is a block of shared time reserved for a small number of purposes—typically to inform, decide, create, or build relationships—with a clearly named reason for why those people are in the same (real or virtual) room right now.
   - **Why It Matters**: If the purpose is vague ("just to sync"), people waste time, prepare poorly, and leave uncertain about what changed; naming the purpose acts as a filter for who should attend, what belongs on the agenda, and what a "good" outcome looks like.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Purpose = Inform / Decide / Create / Relate; Cadence & Time Horizon = operational / tactical.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - meeting
     - purpose
     - agenda

1. Q: Essence card – Choosing when not to meet
   A:
   - **Label**: Choosing when not to meet
   - **Core Idea**: A large share of potential meetings should be handled through asynchronous channels (docs, email, comments, chat) when the work is mainly sharing information, collecting feedback, or tracking progress that does not require live discussion or negotiation.
   - **Why It Matters**: Every meeting consumes expensive, simultaneous time and attention; defaulting to "let's meet" creates calendar overload and fragmented focus, while consciously routing low-stakes updates and detailed discussion to async keeps meetings reserved for decisions, risks, and creative work.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Purpose = Inform vs Decide; Format & Channel = synchronous vs async-supported.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - asynchronous
     - update
     - decision

1. Q: Essence card – Meetings run on inputs–process–outputs
   A:
   - **Label**: Meetings run on inputs–process–outputs
   - **Core Idea**: Effective meetings have clear inputs (pre-work, agenda, background docs), a simple process (how topics are framed, time-boxed, and discussed), and concrete outputs (decisions, action items, owners, and next steps) captured before people leave.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many "bad" meetings are just missing one layer—no inputs, a chaotic process, or fuzzy outputs; viewing meetings as an input–process–output system makes it easier to diagnose where to intervene and which simple practices (pre-reads, facilitation cues, note-taking) will raise quality.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Format & Channel = in-person / remote / hybrid; Participation & Roles = facilitator, note-taker, decision-maker.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - agenda
     - action item
     - minutes / notes

1. Q: Essence card – Roles and decision ownership in meetings
   A:
   - **Label**: Roles and decision ownership in meetings
   - **Core Idea**: Every important meeting implicitly assigns roles—who decides, who advises, who executes, who observes—and making those roles explicit (and lightweight) prevents circular discussion, hidden vetoes, and decisions that "no one really owns" afterward.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without clear decision ownership, meetings drift into endless debate or political maneuvering; simple role clarity (e.g., DRI/owner, contributors, facilitator, scribe) keeps discussion focused and increases the chance that decisions lead to action.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Participation & Roles = decision-maker, contributors, facilitator, note-taker; Purpose = Decide.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - decision-maker
     - DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)
     - facilitator

1. Q: Essence card – Time and attention cost of meetings
   A:
   - **Label**: Time and attention cost of meetings
   - **Core Idea**: Every meeting consumes not only clock time but also fragmented attention and opportunity cost across all attendees; a one-hour meeting with ten people is a ten-hour investment that displaces other focused work.
   - **Why It Matters**: Treating meetings as "free" encourages bloated attendee lists, overly long slots, and recurring sessions with no clear value; recognizing their true cost pushes you to shrink groups, shorten durations, combine topics, or cancel when the benefit is unclear.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Cadence & Time Horizon = recurring vs one-off; Participation & Roles = small vs large groups.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - opportunity cost
     - timebox

1. Q: Essence card – Meetings as links in a larger collaboration flow
   A:
   - **Label**: Meetings as links in a larger collaboration flow
   - **Core Idea**: Meetings are most useful when they sit inside a broader flow of work: context is prepared in documents beforehand, live discussion resolves uncertainties and decisions, and outcomes are captured and fed back into plans, tools, and follow-up communication.
   - **Why It Matters**: When meetings are isolated events with no preparation or follow-through, teams re-discuss the same issues and forget commitments; treating each meeting as a link between "before" (input, alignment) and "after" (execution, learning) makes them a reliable engine for coordinated action.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Purpose = Inform / Decide / Create; Format & Channel = synchronous supported by async; Cadence & Time Horizon = operational / strategic series.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - pre-read
     - follow-up
     - workflow
