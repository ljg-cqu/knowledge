   *Use when*: Messaging friends or close colleagues, informal chats, group chats before a casual morning meet-up

   *Characteristics*: Explicit apology, more formal verbs ("apologize," "arrive"), avoids contractions, impersonal tone  
   *Use when*: Writing to clients, senior management, or in official messages about delayed arrival
   
   **Humorous**: My morning and my alarm clock clearly aren’t on speaking terms—I’m running late.  
   *Characteristics*: Personification (morning and alarm clock "aren’t on speaking terms"), playful tone, self-deprecating humor  
   *Use when*: With friends, relaxed teams that enjoy humor, informal social media posts  
   *Avoid when*: Serious professional contexts, interviews, formal reports

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal for higher-status receivers (managers, clients); casual or semi-formal for peers.
   - *Social Distance*: With close colleagues, semi-formal or lively works; with unfamiliar people, prefer semi-formal or formal.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If lateness is minor, casual/semi-formal is fine; if it disrupts important events, use formal + apology.
   - *Cultural Context*: In cultures valuing punctuality, add an apology and clear ETA; in more flexible cultures, semi-formal is often enough.
   - *Medium*: Email invites more formal phrasing; quick chats or texts can be more casual.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Being too casual with senior stakeholders ("Hey, I’m kinda late lol")—sounds unprofessional.
   - Giving long personal excuses in formal contexts—unnecessary detail weakens the message.
   - Failing to acknowledge impact—saying "I’m late" without apology can seem careless.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many workplaces, a short apology plus an updated arrival time is expected. Some cultures expect more explicit responsibility-taking; others prefer brevity.
