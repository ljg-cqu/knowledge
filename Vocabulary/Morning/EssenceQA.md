## Q1: Designing a simple “My Morning” lesson for beginners

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher planning a basic Morning unit  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: ESL teacher, Students | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are teaching an A2 class about daily routines. The textbook suggests over 30 new expressions for the morning: wake up, get up, hit snooze, sleep in, make the bed, brush your teeth, take a shower, get dressed, check your phone, scroll social media, make coffee, grab a quick bite, cook a big breakfast, pack your bag, rush out the door, miss the bus, commute, get stuck in traffic, arrive just on time, etc. You only have one 45-minute lesson before students write a short paragraph "My Morning on a Weekday." In past classes, learners remembered only wake up and go to work. The coordinator asks you to keep **10–12 truly essential concepts** and move the rest to optional homework.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your reduced morning word list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what you will consciously de-prioritize or ignore** in this lesson, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core wake-up and getting-ready actions (wake up, get up, brush your teeth, take a shower, get dressed).  
  - One or two breakfast patterns (have breakfast, grab a quick bite, skip breakfast).  
  - Simple commute and time words (leave home, commute, arrive on time/late).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Getting ready at home*: wake up, get up, brush your teeth, take a shower, get dressed.  
  - *First energy*: have breakfast, grab a quick bite, skip breakfast.  
  - *Going out*: leave home, commute, arrive on time/late.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters define which 10–12 words enter the core lesson so students can write "On a weekday morning I wake up at 7, get dressed, have breakfast, and commute to work". Fancier phrases like scroll social media, miss the bus, or cook a big breakfast move to extra practice.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: First ensure most students can produce a 5–6 sentence paragraph using at least three target expressions correctly; then add optional phrases.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to cover every suggested phrase; focusing on rare actions instead of the backbone of a typical morning.

## Q2: Structuring a morning-routine onboarding flow in an app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a habit-tracking app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: Product manager, Designer, Engineer, Users | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are designing the onboarding for a new habit app focused on mornings. The UX team proposes many possible questions: what time you wake up, what time you go to bed, how often you hit snooze, whether you check your phone in bed, if you eat breakfast, drink coffee, exercise, meditate, commute, and how you feel (sleepy, refreshed, stressed, calm). You have only three short setup screens before users lose interest. Leadership wants "just enough" structure so the app can suggest a simple morning plan, not a full life audit.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should anchor the onboarding questions and vocabulary.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that are easy for users to answer.  
3. Explain how each cluster **drives concrete product decisions** (what tips or routines the app suggests).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Wake time and reliability (typical wake-up time, weekday vs weekend, hit snooze often or not).  
  - First activities after waking (check phone, get up right away, hygiene, breakfast, coffee).  
  - Self-reported energy and mood (sleepy vs refreshed, rushed vs calm).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Time & rhythm*: usual wake-up time, weekday/weekend difference, snooze behavior.  
  - *Key morning actions*: get up vs stay in bed, basic hygiene, breakfast/coffee, any short exercise.  
  - *Energy & mood*: sleepy/refreshed; calm/in a rush; stressed/relaxed.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which starter routine the app proposes: for example, if users wake late and feel rushed, suggest a "10-minute calm start"; if they wake early but stay sleepy, focus on light, movement, and breakfast. Less critical questions (bedtime details, long-term goals) can wait.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure completion rate of onboarding and early-morning task adherence; prioritize questions that most change suggestions.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Asking too many detailed questions; mixing bedtime and evening habits into a morning-specific flow.

## Q3: Condensing a wellness article about “perfect mornings”

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Content editor for a lifestyle website  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Editor, Readers, Brand | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
A freelancer sends you a 2,000-word article titled "The Perfect Morning Routine." It mentions: waking up at 5 a.m., cold showers, journaling, yoga, breakfast, long to-do lists, checking email, social media detox, sunlight, meditation, gratitude, strict schedules, and numerous quotes from famous entrepreneurs. Your readers are busy workers and parents who complain about "unrealistic" advice. The piece currently feels like a grab bag of tips with almost no structure.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape the final, shorter article.  
2. Group them into **2–3 clusters** suitable for clear sections.  
3. Explain which details you will **downgrade or drop** and how you will measure whether the article helps readers.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Basic sleep and wake-up consistency (wake at a regular time, not necessarily 5 a.m.).  
  - One short focus ritual (journal, plan your day, or express gratitude).  
  - One movement or light exposure block (stretching, walk, open curtains).  
  - Simple breakfast and screen-boundary guidance (eat something, delay email/social media).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Foundation*: consistent wake time and realistic sleep; drop extreme claims.  
  - *Mind & plan*: quick journaling or planning to set intention and mood.  
  - *Body & environment*: movement, light, and uncomplicated breakfast; gentle rules about screens.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive which vocabulary and examples you keep (wake up, refreshed, plan your day, in a rush, skip breakfast, screen time). Cold showers and celebrity routines become optional side notes, not the core.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track reader feedback and clicks on follow-up actions (checklist downloads, shared routines); success means readers try one or two changes, not copy a rigid schedule.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Selling a single "perfect" routine; stuffing the article with names and quotes instead of a few clear morning levers.

## Q4: Planning a family’s school-day morning

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Parent organizing a household morning routine  
**Criticality**: [Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: Parent, Children, Partner | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
A parent with two school-age children describes chaotic mornings: everyone wakes up late, the kids skip breakfast or eat in the car, someone always forgets homework, and they often arrive just before the bell. The parent wants "a calm morning" but has only 60–70 minutes between alarm and leaving home. They can change alarm time, task order, and responsibilities, but not school start time or commute length.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that define a workable school-day morning.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Clarify **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for improving mornings in the next month.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Earlier, consistent wake-up and alarm time.  
  - A fixed sequence for getting ready (get up, get dressed, breakfast, pack bags).  
  - Prepared environment the night before (bags and clothes ready).  
  - Simple shared rules about screens and leaving time.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Time & alarms*: set alarms 15–20 minutes earlier; no repeated snooze; everyone out of bed by a clear time.  
  - *Morning workflow*: a visible checklist for kids (get dressed → breakfast → brush teeth → pack bag).  
  - *Night-before preparation*: homework in bags, clothes laid out, breakfast basics ready.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: alarm times, order of tasks, prep the night before, and simple screen rules (no phone/TV before dressed and breakfast). Out-of-scope: changing school hours or moving house to shorten commute.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive practical changes that turn "rushed and grumpy" into "predictable and mostly calm" mornings.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure days arriving before the bell and number of forgotten items; prioritize earlier alarms and night-before prep first.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to redesign everything at once; ignoring evening habits that make mornings harder.

## Q5: Scoping a “Morning” module in a language-learning app

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Curriculum designer for an English-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Curriculum designer, PM, Engineers, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are defining the scope of a "Morning" vocabulary module. Content writers propose 250+ items: morning idioms, detailed coffee vocabulary, alarm features, advanced productivity terms, and many specific activities. Engineering can only support 60–80 core items in the first release. Marketing wants "fun" phrases; pedagogy wants high-utility words for everyday life and exams.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should define which morning vocabulary is in version 1.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map to learning paths.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** for evaluating whether the module works.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core time and routine terms (morning, early, late, routine, schedule).  
  - Wake-up and getting-ready actions (wake up, get up, take a shower, get dressed, brush your teeth).  
  - Breakfast and commute basics (have breakfast, coffee, grab a quick bite, commute, rush hour).  
  - Mood and energy adjectives (sleepy, refreshed, in a rush, calm).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Time & rhythm*: morning, early, late, weekday vs weekend, routine, schedule.  
  - *Actions & environment*: wake-up, hygiene, breakfast, commute and key places (kitchen, bus stop, station).  
  - *Energy & mood*: sleepy, refreshed, in a rush, calm, stressed.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine which 60–80 items ship first: words that let learners describe their own mornings and understand simple stories or lessons. Advanced idioms (e.g., "not a morning person" variants, coffee snob jargon) move to later packs.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure how many learners can write or say a 5–6 sentence morning description using at least four target terms, plus completion and retention in the Morning module. Prioritize items that appear in coursebooks and everyday conversations.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting fun but rare phrases crowd out essential routine vocabulary; failing to measure whether learners can actually describe their morning.
