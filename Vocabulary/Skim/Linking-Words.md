1. **Linking Word**: overall (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a summary judgment or general conclusion that takes everything into account.
   - *Function*: signals that the speaker/writer is stepping back from details to give a high-level view—ideal after skimming.
   
   **Synonyms**: in general, on the whole, all in all, broadly
   
   **Antonyms**: in detail, specifically, in particular (contrastive in focus)
   
   **When to Use**: When moving from the scattered impressions of a skim to a single, gist-level statement—"Overall, the report is positive"—especially in summaries and briefings.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you are about to zoom into a narrow detail; then "specifically" or "in particular" is more appropriate.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Overall, + [clause]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial most common; sometimes mid-sentence for emphasis
   - **Punctuation**: usually followed by a comma when at the start of a sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Overusing "overall" in every summary sentence; repeating it in a long paragraph.
   
   **Root Analysis**: over (above) + all (everything)
   
   **Etymology**: English expression that became popular as a discourse marker in modern business and academic writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Overall, from a quick skim, the email sounds positive.
   - Overall, the article feels more like marketing than real analysis.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Overall, a preliminary skim suggests that the policy changes are incremental rather than radical.
   - Overall, the executive summaries present a consistent picture of moderate growth.

1. **Linking Word**: in general (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to talk about something in a broad, typical, or usual way, not about exceptions or fine details.
   - *Function*: marks that a statement is based on patterns seen while skimming, not on every single case.
   
   **Synonyms**: generally, on the whole, broadly speaking, as a rule
   
   **Antonyms**: specifically, in detail, in this particular case
   
   **When to Use**: When summarizing what a quick skim of multiple texts or sections suggests—"In general, the feedback is positive"—while leaving room for exceptions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when making a precise, data-backed claim; then use exact numbers or narrower linking phrases ("specifically," "in this sample").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: In general, + [clause]
   - **Position**: mainly sentence-initial; sometimes mid-sentence for contrast
   - **Punctuation**: usually followed by a comma in writing
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using "in general" for one-off cases or when strong evidence is missing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (inside) + general (usual, common)
   
   **Etymology**: English phrase based on Latin-influenced adjective "general," common in academic and formal writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In general, from what I skimmed, people like the new design.
   - In general, her articles are easy to skim and still get the point.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In general, skimming supports coverage across many documents at the cost of fine-grained accuracy.
   - In general, student responses indicate that skimming before close reading improves confidence.

1. **Linking Word**: however (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a statement that contrasts with or seems to contradict something that has been said before.
   - *Function*: signals a shift from a gist statement to an important exception or risk discovered during or after skimming.
   
   **Synonyms**: but, nevertheless, nonetheless, even so
   
   **Antonyms**: therefore, as a result, consequently
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to flag that the high-level impression from a skim hides a key caveat—"However, one section raises a serious concern." This is especially important in risk or compliance contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it for additions without contrast; "and" or "also" is better in that case.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Statement]. However, [contrasting statement].
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence after a semicolon
   - **Punctuation**: followed by a comma when sentence-initial; set off by commas or semicolons mid-sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Starting every sentence with "However"; using it without a real contrast.
   
   **Root Analysis**: how (in what way) + ever (at any time) → historically an adverbial phrase, later fixed as a connector
   
   **Etymology**: Old English elements combined; the discourse-marker use developed over centuries and is now common in formal writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The blog post looks balanced at first glance. However, a closer read shows it's one-sided.
   - The proposal seems fine overall; however, the budget section worries me.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Initial skimming suggests broad agreement across the sources; however, methodological differences limit direct comparison.
   - The executive summary appears optimistic; however, the appendices reveal significant unresolved risks.

1. **Linking Word**: for example (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce one or more specific instances that illustrate a more general statement.
   - *Function*: helps move from gist-level claims produced by skimming to concrete evidence or illustrations.
   
   **Synonyms**: for instance, such as, to illustrate
   
   **Antonyms**: in general, overall (contrast in scope)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to support a broad impression from skimming with one or two pointed references—"Many sections repeat themselves. For example, the introduction and conclusion restate the same bullet points."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when no specific instance is available or necessary; also avoid overloading summaries with too many examples, which defeats the purpose of skimming.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: For example, + [clause] / [general statement]. For example: [noun phrase].
   - **Position**: usually sentence-initial or after a general statement followed by a colon
   - **Punctuation**: often followed by a comma; can appear inside parentheses
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using "for example" without giving an example; confusing examples with exhaustive lists.
   
   **Root Analysis**: for (as) + example (instance that represents a general rule)
   
   **Etymology**: English phrase with Latin roots in "exemplum" (sample, pattern).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A lot of sections repeat themselves. For example, the summary just rephrases the introduction.
   - Some headings are vague—for example, "Stuff we noticed" tells you nothing when you skim.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Several redundancies are visible even on a quick skim; for example, Sections 2 and 4 cover nearly identical content.
   - The report uses strong signaling phrases—for example, "Key risk" and "Decision point"—which aid skimming.
