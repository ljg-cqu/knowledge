1. **Adverb**: briefly (type: time)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For a short time; in a way that does not last long or go into much detail.
   
   **Synonyms**: for a moment, for a bit, shortly, in passing, quickly
   
   **Antonyms**: extensively, in depth, at length
   
   **When to Use**: When describing a short skim of a text, meeting note, or message, especially when you only want the main idea before deciding whether to invest more time.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the action is both short and very intense ("intensively" may be better) or when you are talking about frequency rather than duration.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - read briefly
   - look briefly at
   - briefly skim
   - briefly review
   
   **Root Analysis**: brief (short in time or length) + -ly (adverb-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: French → from Old French "brief" (short), from Latin "brevis." The adverb form "briefly" has been used since Middle English to describe short actions or explanations.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I only looked at the article briefly, just enough to get the gist.
   - Can you briefly skim these notes before we start?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were asked to briefly skim the text before answering prediction questions.
   - The memo was only briefly reviewed, increasing the risk that key constraints were overlooked.

1. **Adverb**: quickly (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At a fast speed; in a way that takes little time.
   
   **Synonyms**: rapidly, fast, swiftly, in no time
   
   **Antonyms**: slowly, gradually, leisurely
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing speed in skimming—moving your eyes fast over headings, bold phrases, and opening sentences to build a rapid overview.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it if you want to stress care or depth rather than speed; in that case, "carefully" or "thoroughly" is more appropriate.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - quickly skim
   - read quickly
   - quickly glance through
   - quickly review
   
   **Root Analysis**: quick (fast) + -ly (adverb-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from Old English "cwic" (alive, lively), which later developed the modern meaning "fast." The adverb "quickly" has been common since Early Modern English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I quickly skimmed the email and saw there was nothing urgent.
   - She quickly looked through the slides before the meeting started.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Users were instructed to quickly skim the abstract before deciding whether to access the full paper.
   - Quickly scanning headings allows readers to construct an outline prior to detailed reading.

1. **Adverb**: roughly (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Approximately; not exactly but close enough for a first impression or estimate.
   
   **Synonyms**: approximately, about, around, more or less
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, accurately
   
   **When to Use**: When connecting skimming with approximate understanding—for example, knowing roughly what a document is about or roughly how an argument is structured.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use it when small differences matter a lot (for example, legal clauses or precise figures); in those situations, you need detailed reading, not rough estimates.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - understand roughly
   - roughly know the structure
   - roughly estimate
   - roughly see what it says
   
   **Root Analysis**: rough (not smooth or exact) + -ly (adverb-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from Old English "ruh" (rough, coarse). The adverb "roughly" gained the figurative sense "approximately" in the 18th–19th centuries.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After skimming the report, I roughly know what direction they want to take.
   - You only need to roughly understand the article for tomorrow's discussion.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Skimming enables readers to form a roughly accurate model of the text before detailed analysis.
   - At this stage, the team needs only a roughly correct forecast, not an exact projection.

1. **Adverb**: superficially (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that only considers the surface or most obvious aspects, without going into depth.
   
   **Synonyms**: shallowly, on the surface, lightly, cursorily
   
   **Antonyms**: deeply, thoroughly, comprehensively
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to highlight that skimming or reading has stayed at the level of appearance, and may have missed deeper patterns, risks, or contradictions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it if you want a neutral or positive tone; "superficially" usually criticizes the quality of attention, not just the speed.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - read superficially
   - superficially skim
   - understand only superficially
   - look at something superficially
   
   **Root Analysis**: superficial (surface-level) + -ly (adverb-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Formed in English from "superficial" in the 17th century, keeping the sense of "only on the surface."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you only skim superficially, you'll miss the subtle warnings in the memo.
   - I understood the idea superficially, but I couldn't explain the details.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Students who process texts only superficially often overestimate their comprehension.
