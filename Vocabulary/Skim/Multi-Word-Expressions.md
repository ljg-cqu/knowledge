1. **Expression**: skim through (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To read or look through a text quickly from beginning to end to get the main ideas, without focusing on every detail.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (other verbs or particles are possible, but "skim through" is a very common partnership).
   
   **Synonyms**: glance through, run through, browse through, flip through, read quickly
   
   **Antonyms**: read carefully, study in depth, go through line by line
   
   **When to Use**: When describing a planned, quick pass over a chapter, article, or report—"skim through the chapter before class"—especially as a pre-reading or triage strategy.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the act is extremely brief ("glance at") or when you are searching for one specific detail ("scan for").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - skim through the article
   - skim through the notes
   - quickly skim through
   - skim through once, then read closely
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "skim" evokes light contact with a surface; "through" emphasizes movement from one end of the text to the other, even if quickly, so together they describe rapid, full-coverage reading.
   
   **Root Analysis**: skim (move lightly over, read quickly) + through (from one end to the other)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’ll skim through the report now and mark the parts we need to read more carefully.
   - Try to skim through the chapter before the lecture so nothing feels totally new.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Students were instructed to skim through the passage to identify major section boundaries.
   - Analysts first skim through quarterly reports to identify sections requiring detailed modeling.

1. **Expression**: skim over (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To move quickly past something, paying little attention to it; to treat it only briefly.
   - *Fixedness*: medium ("skip over" and "gloss over" are related but carry slightly different nuances).
   
   **Synonyms**: gloss over, skip over, touch on briefly, pass over
   
   **Antonyms**: dwell on, dig into, explore in depth
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that someone is not giving a topic, risk, or objection enough attention—"The report skims over the limitations"—often with a mildly critical tone.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the quick treatment is deliberate and adequate; then "briefly summarize" or "treat briefly" may be more neutral.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - skim over the details
   - skim over the risks
   - skim over objections
   - quickly skim over
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "skim" suggests light contact; "over" emphasizes surface-level movement, so together they highlight that something is being treated too lightly.
   
   **Root Analysis**: skim (move lightly over, read quickly) + over (across the surface)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The blog post skims over the hard parts and focuses on the success story.
   - Don't skim over the warnings just because you're in a hurry.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The executive summary skims over key methodological limitations, which may mislead readers who do not consult the appendices.
   - Many popular articles skim over the underlying data and focus instead on eye-catching conclusions.

1. **Expression**: at a glance (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - If you see or understand something at a glance, you notice or grasp it very quickly, often in just one look.
   - *For idioms*: Literal meaning ("in a single look") vs. Figurative/Idiomatic meaning ("with almost no effort or time").
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the words rarely change order or form; "at first glance" is a related, slightly longer variant).
   
   **Synonyms**: immediately, instantly, right away, at first sight
   
   **Antonyms**: only after close reading, only after careful study
   
   **When to Use**: When describing dashboards, diagrams, or summaries designed to be skimmed—"understand the status at a glance"—or when praising clear structure.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when information genuinely requires heavy processing; claiming something is obvious "at a glance" can sound dismissive or unrealistic.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - at a glance
   - at first glance
   - see X at a glance
   - understand Y at a glance
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The image of a single quick look matches the experience of skimming—rapidly taking in a layout or big picture and forming an impression.
   
   **Root Analysis**: at (point in space or time) + a (article) + glance (quick look)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new dashboard lets you see key metrics at a glance.
   - At a glance, you can tell which tasks still need attention.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Well-designed headings allow readers to infer the structure of a paper at a glance.
   - Status indicators should communicate system health at a glance, even to users who only skim.

1. **Expression**: get the gist (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To understand the basic meaning or main idea of something without knowing all the details.
   - *For idioms*: Literal meaning ("obtain the gist") vs. Figurative/Idiomatic meaning ("reach gist-level understanding").
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the verb and noun pairing is highly conventional; small variations like "got the gist" follow normal tense rules).
   
   **Synonyms**: grasp the main point, catch the idea, understand the essence, get the picture
   
   **Antonyms**: miss the point, misunderstand completely, be confused
   
   **When to Use**: When describing the outcome of good skimming—"You don't need every detail; just get the gist"—especially in everyday conversation or informal instruction.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it in very formal academic writing; there, phrases like "achieve a basic understanding" or "grasp the central claim" are more typical.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - get the gist
   - got the gist
   - get the basic gist
   - only get the gist
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Get" is a very common verb for "obtain" or "understand"; combined with "gist" (core meaning), it neatly describes gist-level comprehension that often results from skimming.
   
   **Root Analysis**: get (obtain, understand) + gist (core meaning)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You don't have to read every word—just skim enough to get the gist.
   - I only got the gist of the talk because I came in late.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Even a rapid skim allows readers to get the gist of a text's argument.
   - Instructional materials often aim to help learners get the gist before engaging in close reading.

1. **Expression**: big picture (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The overall view of a situation, including main patterns and directions, but not the fine details.
   - *For idioms*: Literal meaning (a large picture) vs. Figurative/Idiomatic meaning (overall perspective).
   - *Fixedness*: strong (usually appears as "the big picture" in this sense).
   
   **Synonyms**: overall view, big-picture view, high-level view, broad perspective
   
   **Antonyms**: small details, fine print, minutiae
   
   **When to Use**: When explaining what skimming is good at providing—"Skimming helps you see the big picture before deciding where to zoom in."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the focus is on specific numbers or low-level implementation; in those cases "details" or "implementation" is clearer.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - the big picture
   - big-picture view
   - see the big picture
   - keep the big picture in mind
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The metaphor of a "big picture" captures the idea of stepping back from details—exactly what skimming aims to support.
   
   **Root Analysis**: big (large) + picture (visual representation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A quick skim of the report gave me the big picture.
   - Try not to get stuck in details—look for the big picture first.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Skimming allows decision-makers to grasp the big picture before commissioning deeper analysis.
   - Big-picture understanding can emerge from multiple skims across related documents.
