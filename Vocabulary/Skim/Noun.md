1. **Noun**: skim (C, pl: skims)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A quick reading of a text to get the main ideas, structure, or signals rather than full detail.
   - *(Sense 2)* A quick visual pass over information such as dashboards, headlines, or search results to see what stands out.
   
   **Synonyms**: quick read, once-over, pass, overview (sense 1), glance (sense 2)
   
   **Antonyms**: close reading, in-depth study, thorough review
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about the act of moving rapidly through text or information for gist—"a first skim of the report," "a skim of the headlines"—especially when you plan to decide later what deserves deeper reading.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you mean the dairy product (the fat removed from milk); in that case, use "skimmed milk" or "skim" in clearly culinary contexts. Also avoid it where detailed study is expected.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - a quick skim
   - a first skim
   - give it a skim
   - do a skim of the material
   
   **Root Analysis**: From the verb "skim" (to move lightly over a surface or read quickly) used as a noun to label the action.
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → related to Old Norse "skima" (to glance). The reading sense developed metaphorically in the 19th–20th centuries from the idea of moving lightly over the surface.

   **Antonyms**: close reading, intensive reading, slow study
   
   **When to Use**: When describing skimming as a strategy or habit—"Skimming is useful for sorting reading priorities" or "Good skimming depends on clear goals and structural cues."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse it with "scanning," which focuses on locating specific details; use "scanning" when the purpose is to find names, numbers, or keywords.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - skimming strategy
   - effective skimming
   - skimming and scanning
   - practice skimming
   
   **Root Analysis**: skim (verb) + -ing (noun-forming suffix indicating process or activity)

   **When to Use**: When talking about what a good skim should produce—"an overview of the report," "a quick overview of the main risks"—especially in professional or academic settings.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you are describing step-by-step procedures or detailed technical documentation; in those cases "manual," "specification," or "guide" is clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - high-level overview
   - brief overview
   - overview of the key points
   - overview section

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After a quick skim, I can give you an overview of what the article says.

   - understand the gist
   - gist of the text
   - gist-level understanding
   
   **Root Analysis**: Single root with no productive modern affixes in English

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - skim the headlines
   - headline summary
   - headline results
   - headline figures
   
   **Root Analysis**: head (top, beginning) + line (row of text)
   
   **Etymology**: English compound originally describing lines at the head of a page. It became widely used for newspaper titles in the 19th century and then metaphorically for top-level points.
