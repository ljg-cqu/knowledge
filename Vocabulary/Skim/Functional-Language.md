1. **Functional Expression**: Can you skim this and flag anything important? (function: requesting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request asking someone to quickly read a document and highlight key points, questions, or risks.
   - *Formality*: neutral/informal depending on tone.
   - *Directness*: indirect-softened request (uses a question form instead of an imperative).
   
   **Synonyms**: Could you skim this and note the key issues?, Would you mind skimming this for the main risks?, Can you give this a quick skim and mark anything critical?
   
   **Antonyms**: Ignore this for now., There is no need to read this., Do not spend time on this.
   
   **When to Use**: Asking a colleague or peer to do a quick first pass on a document when time is limited but you need a second pair of eyes on what matters most.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid with people in a much higher power position (senior executives) unless softened further; in that case a more formal version is better. Also avoid when deep reading is required; then ask them to "review" rather than "skim."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Can you skim this and highlight the main points?
   - Could you skim this and flag any red flags?
   - Can you give this a quick skim for me?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Politeness comes from the modal "can/could" and the collaborative framing ("for me"). Power distance is modest; it fits peer-to-peer or manager-to-report in many cultures.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Sure, I'll skim it now and send you my notes.
   - I can skim it later today—when do you need it by?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you skim this and flag anything important before I hit send?
   - Hey, can you give this doc a quick skim and see if it makes sense?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Could you skim this briefing and highlight any issues that might concern the client?
   - Please skim this policy draft and flag any sections that need legal review.

1. **Functional Expression**: I only had time to skim it. (function: explaining/hedging)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A way to admit limited familiarity with a text, lowering expectations about how deep your understanding is.
   - *Formality*: neutral; acceptable in many professional settings.
   - *Directness*: fairly direct but softened by reference to time constraints.
   
   **Synonyms**: I just skimmed it., I only managed a quick skim., I didn’t read it in depth.
   
   **Antonyms**: I read it thoroughly., I went through it in detail., I studied it carefully.
   
   **When to Use**: When someone asks for your opinion or decision based on a document, and you need to signal that your view is based on a quick skim, not a full read.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in high-stakes contexts (legal, safety, financial) where skimming is not acceptable; instead, say explicitly that you need more time to review.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I only had time to skim the report.
   - I’ve only skimmed it so far.
   - I just skimmed it on the train.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Functions as a hedge and expectation-setter. It protects your face if you later revise your view after detailed reading.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - No problem—we can schedule time for a deeper review later.
   - That’s fine; a skim-level impression is enough for now.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I only had time to skim it, so don't quote me on the details.
   - I just skimmed it on my phone—I'll read it properly tonight.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - I only had time to skim the documentation, so my comments are necessarily high-level.
   - At this point I've only skimmed the study; a detailed critique will require a closer reading.

1. **Functional Expression**: Just skim the introduction for now. (function: suggesting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A suggestion to limit attention to the start of a text, treating it as a quick entry point rather than reading everything.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral.
   - *Directness*: moderately direct imperative, softened by "just" and "for now."
   
   **Synonyms**: Why don't you skim the introduction first?, You might want to skim only the intro for now., Start by skimming the introduction.
   
   **Antonyms**: Read the whole chapter carefully now., Don't skip any sections., You must go through the full text.
   
   **When to Use**: Coaching someone on how to approach a long article or chapter efficiently—especially when they feel overwhelmed or have little time.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in exam or compliance contexts where partial reading could be dangerous; also avoid with people who may interpret "just skim" as permission to ignore important detail permanently.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just skim the introduction and conclusion.
   - For now, just skim the headings.
   - Start by skimming the intro before you dive into the details.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Positions skimming as a deliberate first step, not a shortcut. "For now" signals that deeper reading may come later.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Okay, I’ll skim the intro and see how it feels.
   - That helps—I’ll start with a quick skim and then decide what to read closely.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just skim the introduction for now; the middle gets pretty technical.
