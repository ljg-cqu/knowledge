1. **Verb**: skim
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T/I)* To read something quickly in order to get the main ideas rather than every detail.
   - *(T)* To move your eyes quickly over the surface of text, paying attention mainly to headings, topic sentences, and visual cues.
   
   **Synonyms**: glance through, browse, run your eye over, read quickly
   
   **Antonyms**: read carefully, study in depth, scrutinize, pore over
   
   **When to Use**: When describing intentional quick reading to form an overview—"skim the report," "skim the chapter," "skim for the main idea"—especially as a first pass.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the reader actually reads every line slowly, or when the context is not about reading at all. Do not confuse it with scanning for specific details; use "scan" when the goal is to find particular information.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - skim a text
   - skim through the article
   - skim for the main points
   - skim quickly
   
   **Root Analysis**: Single root verb with no productive modern affixes in this sense
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from Old Norse "skima" (to glance), originally meaning to move lightly over a surface. The reading sense developed metaphorically in the 19th–20th centuries.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’ll just skim this document now and read it properly after lunch.
   - Skim the chapter first so you know where the important parts are.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Students were instructed to skim the article to identify headings and topic sentences before close reading.
   - Executives often skim long reports, relying on structure and signals to locate decision-critical information.

1. **Verb**: browse
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T/I)* To look through books, websites, or documents in a relaxed way without a fixed plan, often skimming rather than reading in depth.
   
   **Synonyms**: look through, flip through, graze, surf
   
   **Antonyms**: study, analyze, focus intensively, deep-read
   
   **When to Use**: When someone moves lightly across multiple items—articles, pages, search results—skimming to see what catches their interest or seems relevant.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the activity is highly focused and goal-driven; "scan" or "search" may be better in those contexts. Also avoid it in very formal academic writing unless the relaxed, exploratory tone is intentional.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - browse the headlines
   - browse through articles
   - browse a report
   - browse a website
   
   **Root Analysis**: Single root verb in Modern English (related historically to animals grazing)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → originally meant "to feed on leaves and shoots." By the 19th century it gained the sense of looking through books in a casual way.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I usually browse the news and only open the pieces that look worth more than a skim.
   - She browsed through the slides to see what the talk was about.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants initially browsed the digital library, skimming abstracts before selecting full texts.
   - Browsing behavior often consists of short skims across multiple documents rather than sustained engagement with a single text.

1. **Verb**: glance (through/over)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(I/T)* To take a quick look at something, often just long enough to notice the main idea or most salient features.
   
   **Synonyms**: peek at, take a quick look, cast an eye over, have a look at
   
   **Antonyms**: examine, inspect closely, scrutinize
   
   **When to Use**: When the reading is extremely brief—just a momentary skim to see whether something deserves more attention ("glance over the email," "glance through the summary").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you mean sustained skimming across an entire document; use "skim" or "scan" instead.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - glance over the report
   - glance through the notes
   - glance at the headlines
   - glance at the summary
   
   **Root Analysis**: glance (quick look) as base verb; often combined with particles "over" or "through" in reading contexts
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from Old French "glancer" (to strike obliquely); later developed the sense of looking quickly.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I just glanced over the memo, so I might have missed some details.
   - He glanced through the slides in the elevator on the way up.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Verb**: scan
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T/I)* To look through a text quickly in order to find a specific piece of information, such as a name, number, or keyword.
   
   **Synonyms**: search, look through, run your eyes over, hunt for
   
   **Antonyms**: dwell on, read slowly, ignore
   
   **When to Use**: When the focus is on locating details rather than building a general picture—"scan the article for dates," "scan the page for the term 'skim'"—often after an initial skim.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not treat "scan" and "skim" as perfect synonyms. Use "skim" for gist; use "scan" for targeted detail search.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - scan for keywords
   - scan the text
   - scan a document
   - scan the page for figures
   
   **Root Analysis**: scan- (to examine) with no productive modern affixes
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin "scandere" (to climb), later "to scan verse." The modern sense "look over quickly" developed in the 19th–20th centuries.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I skimmed the article first, then scanned it for any mention of our product.
   - Scan the table for anything marked in red.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were instructed to skim for overall structure and then scan for specified target items.

   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T)* To look at part of something or a simplified version of it before engaging more deeply, in order to decide how to proceed.
   
   **Synonyms**: pre-read, sample, take an initial look at, survey
   
   **Antonyms**: ignore, jump in blindly, postpone entirely
   
   **When to Use**: When describing a deliberate skim or sampling of a text, video, or course—"preview the chapter," "preview the slides"—so you can plan how much time and attention it deserves.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it for full, detailed reading; "study" or "analyze" are more accurate there. Also avoid it when no later, deeper engagement is expected.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - preview the chapter
   - preview the material
   - preview the report
   - preview the slides
   
   **Root Analysis**: pre- (before) + view (see)

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Preview the chapter tonight by skimming the headings and summaries.
   - I like to preview articles on my phone and then deep-read the good ones on my laptop.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
