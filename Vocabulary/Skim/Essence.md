1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Skim*, capture the small set of ideas that define skimming as a deliberate reading mode: using quick, goal-directed passes over text to build a gist-level model, triage what deserves deep reading, and protect time without missing decision-critical signals.
   - **Scope**: Covers skimming as a conscious strategy for written materials such as articles, reports, textbooks, dashboards, emails, and search results. Focuses on how to skim, when to skim vs. read closely, and how to manage the risks of shallow understanding. Excludes speed-reading gimmicks that ignore comprehension, non-reading forms of "skimming" (milk, money), and mechanical eye-movement training.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What does effective skimming actually look like, beyond simply reading fast or "being lazy" with text?
     - When is it safe and useful to skim, and when is skimming dangerous because details matter?
     - How can you use headings, structure, and visual signals to guide a quick but meaningful pass through a document?
     - How should you connect skimming with later deep reading, note-taking, and decisions so that skims are not wasted?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Reading Goal**: triage / orient / decide / monitor.
     - **Information Risk**: low (news, opinions) / medium (planning, prioritization) / high (legal, safety, finance).
     - **Text Structure**: strongly signposted (headings, bullets) / weakly structured / noisy streams (feeds, search results).
     - **Follow-Up Plan**: skim only / skim → deep-read later / skim → delegate / skip.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Skimming*: Quick, goal-driven reading that samples structure and signals to build a gist-level model of a text.
     - *Gist*: The core meaning or main idea of a text, without most of the detail.
     - *Signal vs. noise*: Distinction between information that changes decisions and information that can be safely ignored.
     - *Text signals*: Headings, topic sentences, typography, lists, and repeated phrases that reveal structure and emphasis.
     - *Triage*: Deciding which texts or sections to ignore, skim, or read closely under time and attention limits.
     - *Skim–deep cycle*: Pattern where an initial skim shapes what you will later read slowly and how.

1. Q: Essence card – Skimming as goal-directed gist building
   A:
   - **Label**: Skimming as goal-directed gist building
   - **Core Idea**: Skimming is not just "reading fast"; it is a deliberate way of reading that builds a gist-level model of a text in service of a clear goal, such as deciding whether to read deeply, preparing for a meeting, or monitoring a topic.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without a clear goal, skimming collapses into distracted scrolling; time is spent but you cannot say what the text is about or how it affects your decisions.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Reading Goal = triage / orient / decide; Information Risk = low/medium.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - skimming
     - gist

1. Q: Essence card – Using structure and signals as the skimmer’s map
   A:
   - **Label**: Using structure and signals as the skimmer’s map
   - **Core Idea**: Effective skimming treats headings, topic sentences, lists, bold phrases, and visuals as a map: you jump between these signals to reconstruct the outline and main claims without reading every line.
   - **Why It Matters**: If you skim without using structural cues, you either slow down to line-by-line reading or take random snapshots; in both cases, you miss how ideas connect and which sections deserve deep attention.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Text Structure = strongly signposted / weakly structured; Reading Goal = orient / decide.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - text signals
     - heading
     - topic sentence

1. Q: Essence card – Choosing when it is safe (and unsafe) to skim
   A:
   - **Label**: Choosing when it is safe (and unsafe) to skim
   - **Core Idea**: The safety of skimming depends on information risk: skimming social feeds or general articles is low-risk, while skimming contracts, safety procedures, or compliance rules can create serious problems.
   - **Why It Matters**: Treating all texts as equally "skim-able" leads to hidden failures: you might miss a clause, caveat, or constraint that invalidates a plan or violates a rule.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Information Risk = low / medium / high; Follow-Up Plan = skim only vs. skim → deep-read.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - information risk
     - triage

1. Q: Essence card – Skim–deep cycles instead of one-shot reading
   A:
   - **Label**: Skim–deep cycles instead of one-shot reading
   - **Core Idea**: Powerful readers do not choose between skimming and deep reading once; they cycle: skim to map and triage, deep-read selected segments, then skim again to check understanding.
   - **Why It Matters**: A skim–deep cycle lets you cover more material while still giving critical sections the time they need; it also reduces the fear that "if I skim now, I’ll never come back."
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Follow-Up Plan = skim → deep-read later; Reading Goal = triage / learn.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - skim–deep cycle
     - triage

1. Q: Essence card – Managing signal vs. noise under time pressure
   A:
   - **Label**: Managing signal vs. noise under time pressure
   - **Core Idea**: Skimming works only if you use your goal to separate decision-changing signals (claims, numbers, risks) from background noise (anecdotes, padding, repeated slogans) and treat them differently.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without a conscious signal-vs-noise filter, skimming amplifies whatever is most visually loud or emotionally charged, not what is most important for your decision.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Reading Goal = decide / monitor; Information Risk = medium / high.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - signal vs. noise
     - decision-critical

1. Q: Essence card – Designing texts to be safely skimmable
   A:
   - **Label**: Designing texts to be safely skimmable
   - **Core Idea**: Writers and teams can structure documents—through clear headings, summaries, "key risk" labels, and visual hierarchy—so that essential information survives skimming and invites deeper reading where needed.
   - **Why It Matters**: In real organizations, many readers will only skim; designing for skimming is a way to protect decisions and reduce miscommunication instead of wishing everyone would read everything carefully.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Text Structure = strongly signposted; Follow-Up Plan = skim → deep-read / skim → delegate.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - skimmable
     - key risk
     - summary
