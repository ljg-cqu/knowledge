   **Casual**: Can you give this a quick skim and tell me if anything looks scary?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "quick skim" and "looks scary"; friendly tone, everyday vocabulary, informal contraction ("can you").  
   *Use when*: Talking to close colleagues or friends in relaxed, low-power-distance settings.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Could you skim this report and highlight any major concerns?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "could you" (more polite), "highlight" and "major concerns" (neutral professional vocabulary).  
   *Use when*: Standard workplace communication with peers, leads, or cross-functional partners.
   
   **Formal**: Would you be able to skim this report and identify any high-priority risks?  
   *Characteristics*: Longer, more indirect question; "would you be able to" and "high-priority risks" sound careful and respectful.  
   *Use when*: Communicating with senior colleagues, clients, or in written requests where politeness and precision matter.
   
   **Humorous**: Can you skim this monster and circle anything that might blow up in our faces?  
   *Characteristics*: Exaggeration ("monster"), vivid metaphor ("blow up in our faces"), playful tone.  
   *Use when*: Informal chat with teammates who share your sense of humor and understand the risks.
   
   **Lively**: Can you skim this and spotlight the biggest red flags for me?  
   *Characteristics*: Energetic verbs ("spotlight"), visual metaphor ("red flags"), upbeat rhythm.  
   *Use when*: You want to energize a busy teammate and keep the request engaging but still professional.
   
   **Empathetic**: When you have a moment, could you skim this and mark any risks that worry you the most?

   *Use when*: The other person is busy or stressed, and you want to show respect for their workload.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use the semi-formal or formal versions with managers and stakeholders; use casual or humorous only with peers you know well.
   - *Social Distance*: The closer the relationship, the more casual you can be; with new contacts, stay semi-formal.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For serious risk review, prefer semi-formal or formal; humorous language may trivialize concerns.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some workplace cultures expect more indirect, formal requests; others are comfortable with direct casual style.
   - *Medium*: In email, semi-formal or formal reads best; in chat, casual or lively variants feel more natural.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Sounding like you are delegating the entire review instead of asking for a first skim.
   - Being too vague about what counts as "major" or "high-priority" risk.
   - Using humorous or casual phrasing with people who expect a more serious tone.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, asking someone to "skim" can sound careless; framing it as a "quick first review for key risks" may be better.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Peer in a project channel → **Appropriate Variant**: "Could you skim this report and highlight any major concerns?" (clear, polite, professional).
   - **Situation 2**: Manager in email → **Appropriate Variant**: "Would you be able to skim this report and identify any high-priority risks?" (formal and respectful).
   - **Situation 3**: Close teammate in chat late in the day → **Appropriate Variant**: "Can you give this a quick skim and tell me if anything looks scary?" (light tone, acknowledges time pressure).

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Understating the limitation so people assume you read more carefully than you did.
   - Overusing the excuse of "only skimming" instead of planning time for full reading.
   - Using humorous phrasing in serious review settings.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many workplaces, admitting "I only skimmed this" is respected when paired with a plan to follow up; in others, it may be seen as lack of diligence.

   - *Social Distance*: Use more neutral phrasing when working with new teams or external partners.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: In high-stakes domains, emphasize the deliberate nature of the process ("identify sections that warrant intensive reading").
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures strongly separate work and play in language; humorous variants may not travel well.
   - *Medium*: In written plans, prefer semi-formal or formal expressions; in live discussions, lively and empathetic versions can build buy-in.

   - Presenting skimming as a substitute for deep reading instead of a first stage.
   - Being vague about how "deserves a deep read" will be decided.
   - Sounding as if no one will ever come back to important sections.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In educational contexts, explaining the purpose of skimming can help learners see it as a strategy, not as laziness.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Study group for an exam → **Appropriate Variant**: "Let’s skim the material first, then decide which sections merit a detailed read." (clear and practical).
   - **Situation 2**: Product team facing long specs → **Appropriate Variant**: "To keep this manageable, let’s skim the material first and only schedule deep reading time for the most critical parts." (empathetic, time-aware).
