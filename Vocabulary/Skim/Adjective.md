1. **Adjective**: superficial (comp: more superficial, sup: most superficial)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing something that deals only with the most obvious, surface-level aspects and not with deeper structure or detail. (Gradable; both attributive and predicative)
   - *(Sense 2)* Appearing simple on the surface while hiding complexity underneath.
   
   **Synonyms**: shallow, surface-level, cursory, sketchy, slight
   
   **Antonyms**: thorough, in-depth, detailed, deep
   
   **When to Use**: When warning that skimming or a first impression only touches the surface of a topic, text, or situation—for example, a superficial reading of a long report or a superficial grasp of a theory.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you mean "simple but sufficient"; it often carries a negative judgment. Use more neutral adjectives like "high-level" or "overview" if you do not want to imply poor quality.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - superficial reading
   - superficial understanding
   - superficial summary
   - at a superficial level
   - deceptively superficial
   
   **Root Analysis**: super- (above, on top of) + -ficial (face, surface) → relating to the surface
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin "superficialis" (of or on the surface), from "superficies" (surface), formed from "super" (above) + "facies" (face). Entered English in the late Middle Ages with the sense of "shallow, not thorough."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My first, very superficial skim of the article made it look easy, but the details were actually complicated.
   - Don't just give me a superficial summary—tell me what really changes for us.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A superficial reading of the executive summary may hide important caveats buried in the methodology section.
   - The initial analysis was criticized as superficial because it relied only on headline metrics.

1. **Adjective**: cursory
   **Meaning**: 
   - Done quickly and therefore not thorough or detailed; focusing only on the most obvious points. (Gradable; mainly attributive)
   
   **Synonyms**: hasty, quick, sketchy, perfunctory, rushed
   
   **Antonyms**: careful, detailed, exhaustive, painstaking
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to emphasize that someone skimmed a document, email, or report so quickly that they may have missed important details.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the quick look was actually careful and well designed (for example, a planned skim that still protects against risk). In those cases, "selective" or "high-level" is more accurate.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - a cursory glance
   - a cursory skim
   - cursory review
   - cursory inspection
   
   **Root Analysis**: curs- (run) + -ory (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin "cursor" (runner) and "cursorius" (of running), via French. The English adjective came to mean "rushed" or "rapid" in the 17th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I only gave the contract a cursory skim, so we should have legal read it properly.
   - After a cursory glance at the headlines, she put her phone away.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A cursory review of the documentation is insufficient for assessing compliance risk.
   - The findings are based on more than a cursory reading of secondary sources; they reflect in-depth analysis.

1. **Adjective**: selective
   **Meaning**: 
   - Involving careful choice so that only particular people or things are included; not taking everything that is available. (Gradable; attributive and predicative)
   
   **Synonyms**: discriminating, targeted, focused, choosy, strategic
   
   **Antonyms**: indiscriminate, random, unfocused, wholesale
   
   **When to Use**: When describing skimming that deliberately targets high-value sections—such as selective reading of headings, abstracts, and highlighted items while leaving low-value detail for later.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use it when the skipping is careless or unplanned; in that case "cursory" or "superficial" is a better fit. "Selective" suggests thoughtful priorities, not laziness.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - selective skimming
   - selective reading
   - highly selective overview
   - selective attention
   
   **Root Analysis**: select (choose from a group) + -ive (having the quality of)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin "seligere" (to choose), via "selectus" (chosen). English "selective" developed in the 19th century to describe processes that pick only certain elements.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Be selective when you skim—focus on headings and summaries instead of every sentence.
   - I'm very selective about which newsletters I skim each morning.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Effective skimming is a selective process guided by clear reading goals.
   - Selective attention to signaling phrases enables readers to construct a mental outline rapidly.

1. **Adjective**: high-level
   **Meaning**: 
   - Giving only the main ideas or overall structure of something, without detailed explanation. (Non-gradable in most uses; mainly attributive)
   
   **Synonyms**: broad, general, top-level, overview-level, big-picture
   
   **Antonyms**: detailed, granular, low-level, fine-grained
   
   **When to Use**: When you talk about summaries, briefings, or skims that aim to capture the main structure and direction of a text or plan, especially in professional or academic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when the audience actually needs step-by-step instructions or specific numbers; in those cases, "detailed" or "in-depth" is more accurate.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - high-level skim
   - high-level overview
   - high-level summary
   - high-level understanding
   
   **Root Analysis**: high (elevated, top) + level (layer, rank) → focusing on the upper, more general layer of information
   
   **Etymology**: English compound that became common in management and technical communication in the 20th century to contrast with "low-level" or implementation detail.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I just need a high-level skim of the report before the meeting.
   - Give me a high-level idea of what the article says, and I'll decide whether to read it properly.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The executive requested a high-level summary based on a quick skim of the full proposal.
   - High-level reading strategies allow decision-makers to screen large volumes of material efficiently.
