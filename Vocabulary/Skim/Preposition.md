   - *(Spatial)* From one end or side of something to the other, passing inside it.
   - *(Temporal)* From the beginning to the end of a period.
   - *(Abstract)* Across the full content of something such as a document or dataset.
   
   **Synonyms**: across (spatial), throughout, from end to end
   
   **Antonyms**: around (avoiding the interior), outside, past (without entering)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing skimming or moving across the inside of a text—"skim through the chapter," "read through the notes"—or processing material from start to finish, even if quickly.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you mean moving only on the surface without entering ("over") or when referring to being inside a place without motion ("in").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: through the article, through the report, through the slides, through the material
   - **Verb + prep**: skim through, read through, flip through, move through
   - **Adjective + prep**: familiar through repeated skims, visible through headings
   - **Noun + prep**: pass through the text, flow through the document
   
   **Root Analysis**: Single preposition; historically related to "throughout"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from Old English "thurh" meaning "from end to end, through." Used for both literal and figurative passage.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I skimmed through the chapter to see where the exercises start.
   - Can you read through these notes quickly before the call?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Talking about skimming in a light, surface way—"skim over the text," "look over the document"—or reviewing information broadly.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you want to stress moving inside or through something ("through"); "over" suggests surface or high-level contact.

   - **Prepositional phrases**: over the article, over the slides, over the document
   - **Verb + prep**: look over, skim over, go over, glance over
   - **Adjective + prep**: high-level over, general over (less common)
   - **Noun + prep**: overview over (rare; usually "overview of")

   **When to Use**: When describing how skimming jumps across sections, pages, or sources—"skim across the chapters," "skim across multiple articles"—or when patterns appear in many places.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when movement is strictly within narrow boundaries ("within") or through the interior of something ("through").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: across the chapter, across the slides, across the sources
   - **Verb + prep**: skim across, move across, jump across, compare across
   - **Adjective + prep**: consistent across, visible across, repeated across
   - **Noun + prep**: patterns across texts, signals across reports
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + cross (crosswise)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: between skimming and scanning, between a skim and a deep read
   - **Verb + prep**: choose between, balance between, switch between
   - **Adjective + prep**: torn between, split between
   - **Noun + prep**: trade-off between depth and speed
