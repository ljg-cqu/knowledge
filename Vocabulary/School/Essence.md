1. Q: Essence card – School as an organized place for learning
   A:
   - **Label**: School as organized place for learning
   - **Core Idea**: School vocabulary starts with the idea of a school as an organized place where students and teachers meet on a regular timetable to learn specific subjects in shared spaces.

   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: People & Roles; Places & Facilities
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - school
     - classroom

   A:
   - **Label**: People and roles in school
   - **Core Idea**: A small set of words for people and roles (student, classmate, teacher, principal, staff) lets you describe who does what in the school and how they are related.
   - **Why It Matters**: These terms are the backbone of school stories and problems; without them, you cannot say who is responsible, who decides, who helps, or who learns in any given situation.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: People & Roles; Learning & Assessment
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - student
     - teacher

   - **Core Idea**: Words for subjects (maths, English, science), lessons or periods, breaks, and timetables let you explain how the school day is cut into blocks and what happens in each block.
   - **Why It Matters**: Timetable language is needed for planning, giving instructions, and solving everyday problems like being late, changing classes, or comparing school systems.
   - **Type**: pattern

1. Q: Essence card – Lessons, homework, and exams as a learning cycle
   A:
   - **Label**: Lessons, homework, and exams as a learning cycle
   - **Core Idea**: Terms like lesson, homework, assignment, test, exam, and grade describe a simple cycle: learn in class, practice at home, and show results in tests that are turned into marks or reports.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many conversations about school success, stress, or fairness depend on this cycle; if you lack these words, you cannot explain what you are studying, what you must do after class, or how your performance is measured.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Learning & Assessment; Time & Routine
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - lesson

   - **Why It Matters**: School is not only about classes; many real situations, stories, and problems are about behaviour, relationships, and extra activities, and you need this vocabulary to talk about them clearly.
   - **Type**: constraint
