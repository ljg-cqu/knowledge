## Q1: Designing a beginner “School” unit for ESL learners

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher planning a beginner School unit  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: ESL teacher, Students, Curriculum lead | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are teaching an A2-level adult class. The textbook’s School unit proposes over 40 new words: primary school, secondary school, kindergarten, campus, principal, counsellor, caretaker, laboratory, assembly hall, curriculum, elective, compulsory, timetable, homeroom, recess, detention, report card, midterm, final exam, homework, assignment, presentation, extracurricular, club, uniform, and more.  
You have only one 45-minute lesson before a short writing task where students must describe “A day at my school” in 5–6 sentences. Past classes complained that “there are too many school words” and then used only school, teacher, student, homework in their writing.  
Your curriculum lead asks you to keep just **12–15 truly essential concepts** for the core unit and move everything else to optional extension.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your reduced word list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what you will consciously de-prioritize or ignore** in this lesson, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core people words (student, teacher, classmate, principal) so learners can say who is involved.  
  - Core place and object words (school, classroom, playground, desk, board) to set the scene.  
  - Basic routine and time words (lesson, timetable, break/recess, homework) to describe a school day.  
  - One assessment concept (test/exam, grade/mark) to support common exam and story topics.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *People & Roles*: student, teacher, classmate, principal.  
  - *Places & Things*: school, classroom, playground, desk, board.  
  - *Routine & Assessment*: lesson, timetable, break/recess, homework, test/exam, grade/mark.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which 12–15 words enter the core unit and which move to extension (campus, counsellor, elective, midterm). They maximize students’ ability to write “At my school I go to X, learn Y with Z, and do W after class.”  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Start with People & Roles, then Places & Things, then Routine & Assessment. Success metric: in a short paragraph, ≥80% of students correctly use ≥3 of the target concepts.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to cover all 40+ words; focusing on rare job titles or policy words instead of high-frequency school life vocabulary.

## Q2: Structuring a school welcome guide for new parents

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Communications officer at a K–12 school  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: Communications officer, Principal, Parents | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are rewriting the English welcome guide for new parents. Different departments send you paragraphs full of terms: homeroom teacher, subject teacher, counsellor, office hours, attendance, late slip, sick note, parent–teacher conference, school bus, drop-off zone, canteen, library, playground duty, code of conduct, dress code, bullying policy, detention, suspension, after-school clubs, music lessons, sports teams, homework policy, exam week, and report cards.  
Parents previously said the guide “feels like legal text” and still called the office with basic questions like “Who do I email?” and “What time does school really start?”  
You must decide which **few core ideas and words** will structure the guide so that non-native-English parents can actually use it.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should anchor the guide’s vocabulary and sections.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that a busy parent can scan quickly.  
3. Explain how each cluster **drives concrete writing decisions** (headings, examples, what to cut).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clear contact and role words (homeroom teacher, office, principal) so parents know who to reach.  
  - Daily routine vocabulary (start and end times, attendance, late slip, sick note, school bus / drop-off).  
  - Core behaviour and safety terms (code of conduct, bullying, dress code, detention) that directly affect children.  
  - Assessment and meeting words (homework, exam week, report card, parent–teacher conference).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Who & How to Contact*: homeroom teacher, subject teacher, office, principal, email/phone details.  
  - *Day & Safety Rules*: start/end time, attendance, late slip, sick note, school bus, drop-off zone, code of conduct, bullying, dress code.  
  - *Learning & Feedback*: homework policy, exam week, report cards, parent–teacher conferences, after-school clubs only as examples.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape headings like “Who to Contact”, “School Day & Safety”, “Learning & Results”, and decide which terms go into quick-reference tables versus long policy documents. Technical policy detail moves to a separate link.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure drop in basic phone/email questions and survey whether parents can answer “Who is my child’s homeroom teacher?” and “What time does school start?”  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Keeping every department’s wording; mixing roles, times, and punishments in the same paragraph.

## Q3: Explaining the school timetable in an app

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a school timetable app  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Quantified, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: Product manager, Students, Teachers, Parents | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You manage a mobile app that shows students their daily timetable. Different schools use different words: period, block, lesson, homeroom, form time, advisory, assembly, double period, optional class. Some schools run six 50-minute periods, others four 90-minute blocks.  
Your designer wants to show detailed subject codes (ENG101, MATH2B) plus room numbers and teacher initials. Early tests show that younger students and parents feel confused: “What is homeroom?”, “Is lunch a period?”, “Why is there ‘free study’?”  
You have limited screen space and must choose which **few concepts and labels** to standardize in the interface.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that shape how timetable vocabulary appears in the app.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to judge whether timetable wording is clear.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clear names for time blocks (lesson/period, break, lunch) that work across schools.  
  - Simple subject labels (English, Maths, Science) instead of internal codes.  
  - Distinct labels for non-lesson events (homeroom / advisory, assembly, free study).  
  - Start/end times shown visually so users rely less on jargon.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Time Blocks*: lesson/period, break, lunch, start/end times, double periods shown as one longer block.  
  - *Learning vs Non-Learning*: subjects vs homeroom/advisory, assembly, free study, clearly tagged with icons or colors.  
  - *Context & Simplicity*: optional extra info (room, teacher initials) hidden behind a tap, not in the main label.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive UI choices: which labels to translate into plain language, which details to hide, and how to separate “learning time” from “other events” on the screen, reducing lateness and confusion.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track helpdesk questions about timetable terms, late arrivals linked to confusion, and in-app survey ratings of clarity. First optimize block names and separation of learning/non-learning; only then refine codes.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Keeping internal timetable codes on the main screen; mixing lunch, breaks, and lessons under one generic label.

## Q4: Clarifying exam instructions for a mixed-ability school

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: School administrator writing standard exam guidelines  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Administrator, Teachers, Students, Invigilators | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Your school has had repeated problems during exams: some students bring notes to “open book” tests when only the textbook is allowed; others misunderstand “calculator allowed”; parents complain about inconsistent rules between subjects. Existing instructions mix many terms: test, quiz, exam, midterm, final, assignment, open book, closed book, allowed materials, devices, cheating, plagiarism, talking, leaving early, bathroom break, grade, retake.  
You must create one standard English instruction sheet that is printed on every exam paper across the school.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that define how exam vocabulary should be controlled on the sheet.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Clarify **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for this sheet so that it stays short and enforceable.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clear names for assessment types (quiz, test, exam) used consistently across subjects.  
  - Simple, explicit rules for allowed materials and devices (textbook, notes, calculator, phone).  
  - Behaviour rules (talking, leaving seat, cheating, plagiarism) with plain consequences.  
  - Timing and grading terms (start/end time, reading time, grade/retake) that matter on the day.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Type & Time*: what this assessment is called (exam/test) and when it starts/ends, including reading time and rules about leaving early.  
  - *Materials & Devices*: clearly listed “you may bring” vs “you may not bring,” with examples for open-book vs closed-book.  
  - *Behaviour & Consequences*: what counts as cheating or disruption, what happens if rules are broken, in one short paragraph.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: words and rules students must understand on the exam day itself. Out-of-scope: detailed grading policies, long appeals process, or school-wide discipline policy (linked elsewhere).  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape layout (three boxes or sections) and which terms are standardized in exam templates, reducing confusion and fairness complaints.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track incidents of rule-breaking, formal complaints, and clarification questions during exams; aim to reduce them exam by exam.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Overloading instructions with policy text; changing key terms between subjects.

## Q5: Defining the “School Life” module for a vocab-learning app

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a language-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: PM, Curriculum designer, Engineers, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are scoping the School Life module of an English vocabulary app. Content designers propose 400+ words: school types (kindergarten, primary, secondary, boarding), all staff roles, every classroom object, exam and grading terms, extracurriculars, idioms (“old school”), and culture-specific references (SATs, GCSEs).  
Engineering can only support ~80 core items in the first release. Marketing wants “fun school scenes,” while curriculum designers argue for academic words like subject, timetable, exam, grade, homework.  
You must define **what is in vs out of scope** for version 1 so that learners can describe their school experience in simple English.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should define the School Life module’s scope.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map to learning paths.  
3. Propose **1–3 simple metrics** and a priority order for evaluating the module.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday scene vocabulary (classroom, playground, canteen, school bus) that appears in basic stories.  
  - Core people and routine words (student, teacher, classmate, lesson, timetable, break).  
  - Learning cycle terms (homework, assignment, test/exam, grade/mark, report card).  
  - A small set of high-leverage extras (club, uniform, after-school) that colour school life.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Places & Scenes*: school, classroom, playground, canteen, school bus.  
  - *People & Day Structure*: student, teacher, classmate, principal; lesson, period, timetable, break.  
  - *Learning & Results*: homework, assignment, test/exam, grade/mark, report card, club, uniform as optional enrichment.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which ~80 cards ship in v1, balancing high-frequency everyday language with a few academic assessment words so learners can say “I go to X, study Y with Z, and have W after school.” Idioms, culture-specific exams, and rare staff titles move to later packs.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize retention and correct use of People & Day Structure and Learning & Results terms in learner output. Metrics: % of learners who can write or say a short “My school day” text using ≥4 target words, and in-app practice accuracy on those items.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting fun or culture-specific items crowd out core school-life vocabulary; failing to enforce scope so the module becomes a random list.
