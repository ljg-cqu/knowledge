### Q1: Essence of a basic "Miner" vocabulary unit

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher preparing a basic Miner vocabulary lesson for new workers  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: [ESL Teacher, Trainees] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You support a training center that prepares adults with limited English for entry-level mining jobs. A draft unit called "Life of a Miner" proposes more than 40 new words: miner, supervisor, contractor, geology, mineral, deposit, ore, seam, vein, shaft, tunnel, gallery, adit, conveyor, ventilation, refuge chamber, PPE items, regulations, permits, extraction, blasting, processing, and more. You have one 60-minute lesson before a practical safety tour where trainees must follow simple English instructions underground. Previous cohorts reported "too many new words" and then only remembered miner, helmet, and tunnel.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your reduced core word list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what you will consciously de-prioritize or move to extension** in this first unit, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core people and roles needed for simple instructions (miner, supervisor).  
  - Basic place and direction terms (shaft, tunnel, level, exit).  
  - Key safety words (helmet, PPE, hazard, emergency, evacuation).  
  - One or two material/process words that appear on signs (ore, blast).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *People & Roles*: miner, supervisor – who is being talked to and who gives orders.  
  - *Place & Movement*: shaft, tunnel, level, exit, refuge room – enough to follow directions and find safe areas.  
  - *Safety & Warnings*: PPE, hazard, emergency, blast – words that appear on signs and alarms.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters define which 12–15 words go into the core unit so that trainees can understand safety instructions on day one. Less critical items (geological terms, permits, processing vocabulary) move to later modules.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize place and safety clusters, then roles. Success metric: in a short role-play, ≥80% of trainees follow simple English instructions using only core terms.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to cover the full technical list; keeping rare terms while trainees still cannot follow basic safety directions.

### Q2: Essence of a pre-shift hazard briefing

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Safety officer designing a daily pre-shift briefing for underground miners  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Safety Officer, Miners, Supervisors, Control Room] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You must redesign the 10-minute pre-shift hazard briefing. Current briefings are overloaded: supervisors read long lists of gas readings, equipment IDs, geotechnical notes, production targets, maintenance tickets, and safety slogans. Miners report that they "tune out" and only remember the last reminder to "work safely." Yesterday, a near miss occurred when a crew entered a tunnel with poor ventilation and loose rock after a blast, even though the risks were technically mentioned.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should structure the vocabulary of the pre-shift briefing.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster (for example, Conditions / Controls / No-Go).  
3. Explain **how each cluster drives concrete briefing decisions** about what is said, in what order, and what is written on the board.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Today's unsafe *conditions* (gas, ventilation, loose rock, water).  
  - *Controls* and required PPE (ventilation fans, support, masks, lockouts).  
  - *No-go and restricted areas* (which shafts, levels, or tunnels are closed).  
  - One simple *production focus* if needed.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Conditions & Hazards*: ventilation status, gas, ground conditions, active blast areas – everything that can hurt miners **today**.  
  - *Controls & Rules*: PPE, equipment lockouts, speed limits, tag-in/tag-out rules connected to those hazards.  
  - *Map & Movement*: clear naming of shafts/tunnels that are no-go, one preferred travel route.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide the order and wording of the briefing: start with conditions, then controls, then movement; remove long equipment IDs and generic slogans that don't change decisions.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize hazard and control clusters. Track whether crews can correctly repeat "top three hazards" and "no-go areas" after the briefing, and whether near-miss reports mention "not understanding instructions."  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Mixing production and safety messages, listing every ticket, and failing to tie hazard words to exact places.

### Q3: Essence of a shift report that management actually reads

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Shift supervisor writing an end-of-shift report  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Shift Supervisor, Operations Manager, Safety Team] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Shift supervisors currently submit long narrative reports after each shift. They mention blasts, equipment breakdowns, ventilation checks, minor injuries, and informal comments from miners, mixed with slang and local abbreviations. Managers complain they "cannot see what really happened" and cannot compare shifts. You are asked to redesign the template using simple, consistent vocabulary and 3–5 core metrics so that reports show the essence of each shift without losing critical safety signals.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should appear in every shift report.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** so that management can quickly read and compare reports.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - *Production output* (tonnes of ore moved, extraction rate vs plan).  
  - *Safety events* (incidents, near misses, new hazards).  
  - *Critical equipment status* (downtime on key machines).  
  - *Ventilation and ground conditions* summary (normal / warning / critical).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Production & Time*: output, extraction rate, delays.  
  - *Safety & Conditions*: incidents, near misses, new hazards, ventilation/ground status.  
  - *Equipment & Availability*: major equipment breakdowns and duration.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive which words and numbers become mandatory sections in the report; free-text comments become a small add-on instead of the main body. Managers can scan the three clusters to decide whether to intervene, adjust plans, or schedule maintenance.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Define 3–5 standard metrics (e.g., tonnes mined, incident count, near-miss count, minutes of critical downtime, number of new hazards logged). Prioritize safety & conditions first, then equipment, then production.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting narrative dominate; inconsistent words for the same conditions; no clear separation between minor complaints and real safety signals.

### Q4: Essence of modernizing an old underground mine

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Operations director framing a modernization program for an aging mine  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Operations Director, Engineers, Miners, Union Representatives, Regulators] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
An old underground coal mine still uses paper maps, radio calls, and manual logs. Management wants to "modernize" with better monitoring, automation, and safety. Vendors offer everything from real-time location tracking and digital ventilation models to autonomous vehicles and AI production forecasting. Internal documents list dozens of topics: shafts, tunnels, ventilation circuits, escape routes, traffic patterns, ore quality, equipment age, dust and gas levels, incident history, and community impact. You must frame a short concept note that captures the essence of what modernization means for **miners on the ground** and for key stakeholders.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that define the modernization program from a miner-focused perspective.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. State **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for the first wave of modernization, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Visibility of *where miners and machines are* (location and layout awareness).  
  - Real-time view of *hazards and ventilation* (gas, dust, airflow, ground stability).  
  - Reliable *communication and alarms* between underground crews and surface control.  
  - Basic *production and maintenance tracking* to link work to output and downtime.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Situational Awareness*: digital maps, location tracking, and simple on-screen mine layout so everyone shares the same picture.  
  - *Safety Monitoring & Response*: sensors and dashboards for gas, dust, ground movement, and automated alarms tied to clear vocabulary (hazard levels, no-go areas).  
  - *Operations Backbone*: standard digital logs for production and maintenance, replacing unreadable paper notes.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: tools that improve awareness, safety, and basic reporting for miners and supervisors within 1–2 years. Out-of-scope for the first wave: full automation, experimental AI forecasting, or major mine redesign.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape which projects are funded first and how you explain modernization to miners, unions, and regulators using clear, shared terms.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting vendor buzzwords define scope; focusing on shiny automation instead of basic safety and communication.

### Q5: Essence of a "Miner" safety poster campaign

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Communications specialist designing a safety poster series for miners  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Communications Specialist, Safety Department, Miners, Supervisors] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
The mine wants a new poster campaign to reduce accidents linked to poor communication: miners entering wrong tunnels, ignoring ventilation warnings, and removing PPE in hot areas. Draft posters are crowded with text: long rules, full legal phrases, and multiple icons per sign. Some use technical words (asphyxiation, overexposure) that many workers with limited English or literacy do not fully understand. You must design a small set of posters that rely on a **minimal, consistent vocabulary** and a few numbers (for example, gas limits, distances) that miners can actually remember.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape the language and layout of the safety posters.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to judge whether the campaign works.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - A tiny set of *core safety words* reused everywhere (hazard, no entry, gas, blast, PPE).  
  - Clear *place and direction vocabulary* (this tunnel, that shaft, exit, safe room).  
  - 1–2 *numeric limits* that matter (for example, gas level threshold, minimum distance from blast area).  
  - Strong *visual pairing* of words with symbols.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Stop / Go Language*: consistent words and colors for no entry, danger, and safe routes.  
  - *Hazard & Limit Language*: simple phrases for gas, dust, heat, and clear numeric thresholds where needed.  
  - *PPE & Behavior*: short, repeated phrases for required equipment and actions (helmet on, mask on, tag in/out).  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which words appear on every poster, what gets dropped, and how symbols are standardized. Legal text moves to back-of-house documents; posters show only the vocabulary that changes behavior.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure recall of key words and limits in short quizzes, observe behavior at high-risk points (correct tunnel use, PPE compliance), and track incident/near-miss rates in targeted areas before and after.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Mixing many synonyms, overloading posters with text, and using technical terms that frontline miners do not truly understand.
