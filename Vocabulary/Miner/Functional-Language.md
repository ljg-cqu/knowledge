# Extract Functional Language for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract functional language expressions and speech acts that are essential for pragmatic communication and social interaction from the **Miner** source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one functional expression or speech act pattern with comprehensive learning information including pragmatic function, usage context, formality level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all functional expressions that perform specific communicative actions
- Prioritize: requesting, suggesting, refusing, agreeing/disagreeing, expressing opinions, hedging, clarifying, turn-taking
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency social interactions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both direct and indirect speech acts

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in functional expressions actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard pragmatic descriptions

**Focus:**
- Requesting and asking (Can you...?, Would you mind...?, I was wondering if...)
- Suggesting and recommending (Why don't we...?, How about...?, You might want to...)
- Agreeing and disagreeing (I see your point, but..., That's a fair point, I'm afraid I disagree)
- Expressing opinions (In my view..., It seems to me that..., I tend to think...)
- Refusing and declining (I'd love to, but..., I'm not sure I can..., That won't be possible)
- Clarifying and checking understanding (Do you mean...?, Just to clarify..., If I understand correctly...)
- Interrupting and turn-taking (Sorry to interrupt, but..., If I may add..., Can I just say...)
- Hedging and softening (It might be..., I suppose..., To some extent...)

**Format:**
- **Functional Expression**: [pattern with variables] (function: requesting/suggesting/refusing/etc.)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain communicative function clearly*
  - *Describe illocutionary force (direct/indirect)*
  - *Include formality level: very formal/formal/neutral/informal/very informal*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative expressions with same function and similar formality
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 expressions with opposite communicative effect (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, relationships where this expression is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this expression would be inappropriate, too direct/indirect, or offensive
- **Common Variations**: Alternative forms with slight differences in tone or formality
- **Pragmatic Notes**: Cultural considerations, politeness strategies, face-saving aspects
- **Response Patterns**: Typical replies or follow-up expressions
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example dialogues/sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example dialogues/sentences in formal/professional register
