1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Miner*, capture the small set of ideas and terms that let you describe miners, mine layouts, extraction processes, and safety/economic realities of working in mines in clear, practical English.
   - **Scope**: Focus on mining as an industrial activity: the people who work in mines, the physical spaces they move through, the materials they extract, the core processes and equipment they use, and the language of safety and risk. Excludes advanced geology formulas, detailed corporate finance, or metaphorical/data/crypto "miners" except as clearly marked extensions.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When you talk about a miner or mining operation, what basic concepts (people, place, material, process, risk) must you name first?
     - How do you describe the structure of a mine (shafts, tunnels, seams), the movement of air and material, and the main stages of extraction?
     - How do you identify and communicate key hazards, controls, and emergency situations so that everyone understands the same picture?
     - How do you connect day-to-day miner work to production targets, costs, regulations, and environmental impact?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Element of operation**: People / Place / Material / Process / Safety & Risk / Economics & Impact.
     - **Mining method**: Underground / Open-pit / Quarry / Processing plant.
     - **Time frame**: Planning & development / Active extraction / Closure & rehabilitation.
     - **Safety criticality**: Routine / Hazardous / Emergency.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - Miner: A person who works in a mine extracting coal, minerals, or other valuable materials from the earth.
     - Mine: An industrial site where minerals, coal, or other materials are extracted from underground or surface deposits.
     - Shaft: A deep, usually vertical passage that provides access to underground mine workings.
     - Tunnel: A horizontal or gently sloping underground passage used for access, transport, or extraction in a mine.
     - Ore: Rock or mineral that contains enough valuable material to be mined and processed profitably.
     - Ventilation: The system that moves fresh air through mine workings and removes dangerous gases, dust, and heat.
     - Hazard: A source of potential harm in the mine environment, such as gas, loose rock, machinery, or explosion.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Geology, Energy & resources, Industrial engineering, Workplace safety.
     - **Siblings**: Coal, Metal, Oil & Gas, Construction, Heavy machinery, Hazard, Safety, Workplace.
     - **Downstream**: Mine planning, Ventilation design, Safety training materials, Incident reports, Environmental impact statements, Crypto/Bitcoin miner vocabulary.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Roles, Action, Quantified].
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: Miners, supervisors, safety officers, engineers, planners, translators, students.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen; refresh examples and regulatory references as mining technology and safety standards evolve.

1. Q: Essence card – Miner as person in a place–material–risk system
   A:
   - **Label**: Miner as person in a place–material–risk system
   - **Core Idea**: The word *miner* always sits inside a system: a person, in a specific mine layout, working on particular material under defined risks; core vocabulary must tie who, where, what, and which hazards together.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without language that links people, location, material, and risk, instructions, incident reports, and training stay vague ("go over there", "it was dangerous") instead of precise enough to keep crews safe and coordinated.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Element of operation = People + Place + Process; Time frame = active extraction.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - miner
     - mine
     - shift

1. Q: Essence card – Mine layout terms as the shared map
   A:
   - **Label**: Mine layout terms as the shared map
   - **Core Idea**: Words like shaft, tunnel, level, face, and seam create a shared mental map of the mine so that everyone understands exactly where work, hazards, and equipment are located.
   - **Why It Matters**: Clear spatial vocabulary prevents crews from going to the wrong place, missing hazards, or getting lost during routine operations or evacuation; small misunderstandings about layout can turn into serious accidents underground.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Element of operation = Place; Mining method = underground vs open-pit.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - shaft
     - tunnel
     - seam

1. Q: Essence card – Ore, waste, and extraction language
   A:
   - **Label**: Ore, waste, and extraction language
   - **Core Idea**: Terms such as ore, seam, vein, extraction, and recovery describe which rock has value, where it lies, and how it is removed and processed.
   - **Why It Matters**: This vocabulary underpins production planning, reporting, and legal or commercial documents; confusing ore with waste, or being vague about extraction, can lead to wrong plans, contractual disputes, or unsafe boundaries between working and forbidden areas.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Element of operation = Material + Process; Time frame = planning & active extraction.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - ore
     - seam
     - extraction

1. Q: Essence card – Safety, hazard, and control vocabulary
   A:
   - **Label**: Safety, hazard, and control vocabulary
   - **Core Idea**: Words like hazard, risk, ventilation, gas, PPE, evacuation, and blast form the minimal language to talk precisely about dangers and how they are controlled in mines.
   - **Why It Matters**: In mining, misused or missing safety terms can kill; crews, supervisors, and regulators need the same specific words for hazards, limits, alarms, and procedures so that orders and warnings cannot be misread.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Element of operation = Safety & Risk; Safety criticality = hazardous / emergency.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - hazard
     - ventilation
     - blast

1. Q: Essence card – Production, time, and impact vocabulary
   A:
   - **Label**: Production, time, and impact vocabulary
   - **Core Idea**: Terms such as output, extraction rate, downtime, maintenance, and rehabilitation connect what miners do in a shift to production targets, costs, and long-term impact on land and communities.
   - **Why It Matters**: This language allows miners, managers, and external stakeholders to discuss trade-offs between speed, safety, and sustainability; without it, instructions stay at the level of "work faster" instead of measurable plans and accountable outcomes.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Element of operation = Process & Economics; Time frame = shift / quarter / life-of-mine.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - output
     - extraction rate
     - rehabilitation
