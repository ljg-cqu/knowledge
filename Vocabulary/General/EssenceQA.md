### Q1: Essence of choosing high-value general vocabulary for study

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: Upper-intermediate student planning vocabulary study
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Student, Teacher] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:
You are preparing for an English exam that includes essays and graph descriptions. Your teacher gives you a long list of advanced words, but your time is limited. When you read model answers, you notice that many sentences rely on a small set of general verbs (increase, reduce, improve), adjectives (major, significant, typical), and adverbs (generally, mainly, slightly). You feel torn between memorizing rare synonyms and mastering these common general words. You also know that you need language that works across topics, not only in one textbook unit.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should guide which general vocabulary you study first.
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.
3. Explain **why each cluster matters** for exam performance, and **what vocabulary you would consciously de-prioritize**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:
  - Prioritize general change verbs that appear in many tasks (increase, reduce, improve, manage).
  - Focus on evaluation adjectives that grade importance and typicality (major, significant, basic, typical, common).
  - Learn degree and frequency adverbs that control strength of claims (generally, mainly, significantly, slightly, relatively).
  - Practice whole sentence frames that combine these items, not isolated word lists.
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:
  - *Change & Results Verbs*: A small core of verbs to describe trends, progress, and problems in any topic.
  - *Evaluation & Degree Words*: Adjectives and adverbs that express how big, important, or common something is.
  - *Reusable Sentence Frames*: Short patterns such as 'X has significantly increased' or 'This is a major problem in many areas'.
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide where limited study time goes: into high-frequency general words that appear in most tasks, rather than rare synonyms that add little score.
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track 'number of clear example sentences you can write and correct with these words' rather than total words memorized.
- **Common Failure Modes**: Chasing long synonym lists; ignoring adverbs and frames; learning definitions without practicing sentences.

### Q2: Essence of simplifying technical results for a general audience

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Junior analyst writing a summary for non-technical managers
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Analyst, Manager, Client, Team Lead] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:
You have a technical report full of domain terms and numbers. Your manager asks you to write a one-page summary for senior managers who are not experts. They care about what changed, how serious it is, and what to do next. You notice that many technical phrases can be replaced by general verbs (improve, increase, reduce), adjectives (major, significant, complex, efficient), and adverbs (significantly, slightly, generally). If you keep all the technical language, the summary will be accurate but hard to read; if you remove too much, it may sound vague.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** in your choice of general vocabulary that will most improve the summary for non-technical readers.
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.
3. Explain **how each cluster changes concrete decisions or actions** in how you rewrite the report.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:
  - Use general change verbs (improve, increase, reduce) to state what happened to key metrics.
  - Use evaluation adjectives (major, significant, complex) to grade impact and difficulty.
  - Use degree adverbs (significantly, slightly, generally) to signal how strong the effects are.
  - Keep a few essential technical terms only where they truly affect decisions.
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:
  - *Change & Impact Language*: Combine general verbs and adjectives to say what changed and how serious it is ('a significant increase in cost', 'a slight reduction in errors').
  - *Degree & Uncertainty*: Use adverbs to show scale and confidence without over-claiming ('generally effective', 'significantly better').
  - *Necessary Technical Terms Only*: Retain a small set of domain words that managers must know, but explain them using general language.
- **Decision Link**: These clusters control how well managers can quickly see what matters and decide on action without being blocked by jargon.
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Monitor 'number of sentences that a non-expert can paraphrase correctly' and 'use of general vs technical terms in topic sentences'.
- **Common Failure Modes**: Leaving dense technical phrases untouched; or, on the other side, deleting all precise language and replacing it with empty general words like 'good' or 'bad'.

### Q3: Essence of controlling claim strength in a short report

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Research assistant summarizing findings for a short report
**Criticality**: [Risk, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Researcher, Reviewer] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:
You are writing a one-page summary of a small study. Some results are clear, but the sample size is limited. A senior researcher warns you not to overstate the findings. You have to choose between strong words like 'prove', 'always', 'never' and more general language like 'suggest', 'generally', 'mainly', 'relatively small', 'significant but limited'. You must also decide when to mention exact numbers and when a general description is enough.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** in general vocabulary that control how strong or cautious your claims sound.
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** for checking whether your language is safely balanced.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:
  - Replace absolute adverbs ('always', 'never') with general-frequency adverbs ('generally', 'mainly').
  - Use degree adverbs ('slightly', 'significantly', 'relatively') to grade effect size.
  - Choose evaluation adjectives that match evidence ('significant', 'modest', 'complex') instead of extreme praise.
  - Use general verbs ('suggest', 'indicate', 'seem to improve') rather than 'prove' when evidence is limited.
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:
  - *Frequency & Typicality*: Words like generally and mainly that show something is often true but not universal.
  - *Degree & Size of Effect*: Adverbs such as slightly, significantly, relatively that make size of change visible without exact numbers.
  - *Cautious Verbs & Adjectives*: Neutral verbs and grading adjectives that keep claims honest.
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide whether readers interpret the study as early evidence or absolute truth, which affects risk of misusing results.
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Count 'number of absolute claims' and reduce them; ensure most key findings are paired with a degree word or precise number.
- **Common Failure Modes**: Mixing 'significant' in everyday and statistical senses; using strong general words that promise more certainty than the data allow.

### Q4: Essence of setting language norms for team status updates

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Team lead defining vocabulary guidelines for weekly updates
**Criticality**: [Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Team Lead, Team Members, Manager, Stakeholder] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:
Your team sends weekly written status updates. People use different words: one person writes 'slight delay', another says 'major issue', someone else says 'generally on track but with some problems'. Leadership complains that they cannot compare updates, because the language is inconsistent. You cannot control every sentence, but you can suggest a small shared set of general verbs, adjectives, and adverbs and give examples of how to use them.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** in the general vocabulary that should be standardized across updates.
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.
3. Clarify **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for your language guidelines so that they stay simple and practical.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:
  - Shared scale words for impact and urgency (minor, major, significant, typical).
  - Common verbs for change and status (increase, reduce, improve, handle, manage).
  - Degree adverbs for delays and risk (slightly, significantly, generally).
  - A few time adverbs (currently, eventually) to mark present vs future concerns.
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:
  - *Impact & Status Vocabulary*: A small, defined set of adjectives and adverbs linked to examples ('minor issue' vs 'major issue', 'currently blocked').
  - *Change & Action Verbs*: Verbs that describe what the team is doing about the situation (reduce risk, improve performance, handle incidents).
  - *Examples & Templates*: Short sample sentences that show how to combine these words in updates.
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: a one-page guide listing preferred general words and example sentences. Out-of-scope: forcing everyone to use identical sentences or banning all domain-specific vocabulary.
- **Decision Link**: These clusters let managers quickly compare updates and decide where to focus attention.
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track 'percentage of updates that use the shared scale words correctly' and 'number of confusing status phrases reported by readers'.
- **Common Failure Modes**: Creating a long, theoretical style guide that nobody reads; or giving no examples, so words remain vague.

### Q5: Essence of improving your own use of general vocabulary

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Professional designing a personal vocabulary-improvement plan
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Individual, Manager, Mentor] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:
You often feel your English is either too simple ('good', 'bad', 'a lot') or too technical. You want to sound clear and professional in emails, reports, and meetings by using a stronger set of general verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. You have limited time each week and do not want a huge project. You decide to focus on a small group of high-value words like manage, improve, increase, reduce, major, significant, practical, efficient, generally, significantly, slightly, currently, and relatively.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that matter most for improving your use of general vocabulary as a skill.
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** for a realistic 3–6 month practice plan.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:
  - Selecting a small, fixed core list of general verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
  - Practising them in real sentences taken from your own emails and reports.
  - Getting feedback on tone, strength, and clarity from a mentor or teacher.
  - Reviewing and adjusting the list based on where you actually use English.
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:
  - *Core List & Contexts*: Build a personal list (for example 20–30 general words) mapped to typical situations (describing change, evaluation, frequency).
  - *Deliberate Practice*: Rewrite real messages using these words; keep before/after versions so you can see how tone and precision change.
  - *Feedback & Review*: Once a week, ask someone to check a few sentences and note where a different general word (for example 'significant' vs 'slight') would fit better.
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide how you spend limited practice time so that you improve reusable language, not rare words.
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track 'number of real sentences per week using your core list', 'number of items you can use confidently without a dictionary', and later 'feedback from readers on clarity and tone'.
- **Common Failure Modes**: Collecting long word lists with no practice; focusing on rare words instead of general ones; changing the list so often that nothing becomes automatic.
