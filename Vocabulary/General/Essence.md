1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of General vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *General*, gather a small set of high-leverage verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that you can reuse in almost any context to describe change, importance, typicality, frequency, and the strength of statements in clear English.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on neutral, widely used items such as handle, manage, improve, increase, reduce, basic, major, significant, typical, common, generally, mainly, significantly, slightly, currently, eventually, and relatively. Excludes technical jargon, fixed idioms, slang, and very domain-specific phrases.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When you describe a situation in English, which few general verbs and adjectives let you talk about change, management, and evaluation without needing topic-specific vocabulary?
     - How can you control the strength of your claims using general adverbs of degree and frequency so that you avoid sounding too strong or too weak?
     - How do you keep statements usefully general (common, typical, generally true) while still leaving room for exceptions and precise numbers?
     - Which general words work well in both everyday conversation and professional or academic writing?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Grammatical Role**: Verb / Adjective / Adverb.
     - **Communicative Function**: Change and management; evaluation and importance; frequency and typicality; degree and uncertainty; time and development.
     - **Register & Tone**: Casual vs neutral vs formal; cautious vs strong claims.
     - **Precision Level**: Broad generalization vs quantified or narrowly defined statements.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *general*: Describing most cases or a broad group, not a single specific example.
     - *generalization*: A statement about what usually happens or is usually true across many cases.
     - *hedging*: Softening or limiting a statement so that it does not sound absolute.
     - *degree adverb*: An adverb like slightly, significantly, or relatively that shows how strong or large something is.
     - *frequency adverb*: An adverb like generally or mainly that shows how often or how widely something is true.
     - *register*: The level of formality and style that fits a situation (casual, neutral, formal).
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: English grammar basics; Vocabulary packs for Verb, Adjective, Adverb; Sentence structure.
     - **Siblings**: Precision vocabulary; Quantifier and number vocabulary; Modality and probability vocabulary; Formality and register vocabulary.
     - **Downstream**: Essay and report writing; Presentation and meeting language; Exam tasks that require describing trends, results, and general patterns.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: Blocks, Roles, Quantified.
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: English learners at B1–C1 level, students, knowledge workers, teachers, content writers.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.
