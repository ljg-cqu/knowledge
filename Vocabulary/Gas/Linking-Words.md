# Gas Vocabulary - Linking Words & Discourse Markers

1. **Linking Word**: because (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For the reason that; since; introducing a clause that gives the reason or cause for something.
   - *Function*: Indicates causation and explains why something happens.
   
   **Synonyms**: since, as, for the reason that, due to the fact that, seeing that
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, although, even though (contrast, not causation)
   
   **When to Use**: Explaining causes of gas behavior, emissions, reactions; scientific reasoning; answering "why" questions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When showing contrast or concession; avoid in very formal writing (prefer "since" or "as").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Effect] + because + [cause clause]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence, connecting main clause to dependent clause
   - [Punctuation]: no comma when "because" follows main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: sentence fragments (starting sentence with "because" without main clause)
   
   **Root Analysis**: by + cause
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English bi cause (by cause) → because (1300s)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The gas leaked out because the valve was broken.
   - Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas because it traps heat in the atmosphere.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Methane concentrations are increasing because of enhanced emissions from agricultural sources.
   - Natural gas is preferred over coal because it produces fewer carbon emissions per unit energy.

1. **Linking Word**: when (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At or during the time that; on the occasion that.
   - *Function*: Indicates temporal relationship between two events or conditions.
   
   **Synonyms**: while, as, whenever, at the time that, as soon as
   
   **Antonyms**: (no direct antonyms for temporal conjunctions)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing conditions for gas behavior, timing of reactions, temperature/pressure relationships, sequential processes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For causation (use "because"); for conditions not related to time (use "if").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Event 1] + when + [event 2], or When + [event 1], [event 2]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or mid-sentence

   **Antonyms**: (no direct antonyms)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing conditional gas behavior, safety warnings, hypothetical scenarios, dependencies.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For temporal relationships (use "when"); for certainties (use "when" not "if").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: If + [condition], [result] or [Result] + if + [condition]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma after dependent clause when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using future tense in "if" clause (use present for future meaning)
   
   **Root Analysis**: if (Old English gif)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English gif (if, whether) → Middle English if
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you smell gas, get out immediately and call for help.

   **Etymology**: Old English þus (in this way) → Middle English thus
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used in casual speech)
   - The gas is flammable, thus we need to be careful.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
