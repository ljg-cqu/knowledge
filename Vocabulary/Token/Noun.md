   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The token has great liquidity—you can buy or sell millions without moving the price much.
   - Low liquidity means you might crash the price if you try to sell a large amount.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Liquidity provision through automated market makers enables continuous token trading without traditional order book matching requirements.
   - Fragmented liquidity across multiple exchanges and chains reduces capital efficiency and increases slippage for large token transactions.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Interoperability lets you use the same tokens on different chains without being locked into one ecosystem.
   - Without interoperability, you're stuck on one blockchain and can't access other networks' features.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Interoperability solutions employ bridge protocols, relay chains, and cross-chain messaging systems to enable asset transfers across heterogeneous blockchain architectures.
   - Achieving secure interoperability requires consensus verification mechanisms preventing double-spend attacks across connected blockchain networks.

1. **Noun**: standard (C, pl: standards)
   **Meaning**:

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Set your slippage tolerance to 2% or the trade might fail if the price moves too much.
   - High slippage means you got a worse price than expected because there wasn't enough liquidity.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Slippage in automated market makers increases proportionally with trade size relative to liquidity pool depth, following bonding curve mathematics.
   - Optimal trade routing across multiple liquidity venues minimizes slippage by fragmenting large orders and aggregating optimal price discovery paths.
