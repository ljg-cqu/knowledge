# Token - Linking Words & Discourse Markers

1. **Linking Word**: whereas (type: subordinating conjunction - contrast)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to show contrast between two different token types, mechanisms, or characteristics by introducing a contrasting clause
   - *Function*: Indicates comparison highlighting differences; creates formal contrast structure
   
   **Synonyms**: while, but, in contrast, on the other hand
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, just as
   
   **When to Use**: In comparative analysis of tokenomics models, contrasting different token types (fungible vs. non-fungible), formal writing comparing protocol mechanisms
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation where "but" or "while" would suffice, when showing similarity rather than contrast, in informal content where formal tone is inappropriate
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Independent clause] + whereas + [contrasting independent clause]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence connector or sentence-initial (formal)
   - [Punctuation]: preceded by comma when mid-sentence; followed by comma when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overuse in casual writing, using when similarity is meant
   
   **Root Analysis**: where (place) + as (comparison) → "in which place/case"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "where as" → "whereas" (14th century) → formal contrast conjunction
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Utility tokens give you access to services, whereas governance tokens let you vote.
   - Bitcoin is deflationary with a fixed supply, whereas Ethereum has ongoing issuance.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Fungible tokens represent interchangeable units of value, whereas non-fungible tokens denote unique, indivisible assets with distinct characteristics.
   - Centralized stablecoins maintain collateralization through fiat reserves, whereas algorithmic stablecoins employ programmatic supply adjustments to maintain parity.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Independent clause]. Therefore, [consequent clause].
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), mid-sentence (between commas)
   - [Punctuation]: preceded by period or semicolon; followed by comma

   **Etymology**: Old English "thærfore" → Middle English "therefore" → formal logical connector
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The token has no real utility, therefore it's basically just speculation.
   - Gas fees were extremely high yesterday; therefore, I postponed the transaction.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
