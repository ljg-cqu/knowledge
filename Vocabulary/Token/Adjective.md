# Token - Adjectives

1. **Adjective**: fungible
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Finance/Blockchain) Describing assets or tokens that are mutually interchangeable because each unit has the same value and properties as another unit. Non-gradable, typically attributive.
   
   **Synonyms**: interchangeable, exchangeable, substitutable, equivalent, uniform
   
   **Antonyms**: non-fungible, unique, distinctive, irreplaceable
   
   **When to Use**: When describing tokens or assets that can be exchanged one-for-one without loss of value, such as cryptocurrencies, where one Bitcoin is identical to any other Bitcoin.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing unique digital assets like NFTs, collectibles, or items with individual characteristics that affect their value.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - fungible token
   - fungible asset
   - perfectly fungible
   - mutually fungible
   - fungible currency
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "fungi" (to perform) + "-ible" (able to be) → "able to serve in place of another"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin fungibilis → Medieval Latin → English legal terminology (17th century) → modern blockchain usage (2010s)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Bitcoin is fungible, so you can swap one coin for another without any difference in value.
   - Unlike NFTs, regular crypto tokens are fungible—they're all worth the same.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Fungible tokens represent a standardized unit of value within blockchain ecosystems.
   - The protocol implements fungible token standards to ensure liquidity and interoperability.

1. **Adjective**: non-fungible
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Blockchain) Describing digital assets or tokens that are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis because each has distinct properties and value. Non-gradable, typically attributive.
   
   **Synonyms**: unique, distinctive, one-of-a-kind, irreplaceable, singular
   
   **Antonyms**: fungible, interchangeable, identical, uniform, standardized
   
   **When to Use**: When describing tokens representing unique digital or physical items like art, collectibles, real estate, or identity credentials where each token has individual characteristics.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - non-fungible token (NFT)
   - non-fungible asset
   - non-fungible digital item
   - non-fungible collectible
   
   **Root Analysis**: "non-" (not) + "fungible" (interchangeable) → "not interchangeable"

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - NFTs are non-fungible, so each one is unique and can't be swapped for another at the same value.

   **Synonyms**: functional, service-based, access-providing, usage-oriented
   
   **Antonyms**: security, investment-focused, equity-based, dividend-bearing
   
   **When to Use**: When describing tokens that grant holders rights to use platform features, pay for services, or participate in network operations rather than representing ownership or investment returns.

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Inflationary tokenomics balance network security incentivization through staking rewards against potential value dilution from supply expansion.
