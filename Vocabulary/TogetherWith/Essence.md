1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of vocabulary for "TogetherWith"?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: Provide an 80/20 set of English words, phrases, and patterns that express the idea of being, acting, or existing together with someone or something else, so that learners can describe joint actions, shared situations, and combined items clearly.
   - **Scope**: Focus on high-frequency prepositions, adverbs, and chunks built around the idea of *together with* (physically together, doing something jointly, adding one thing to another, mentioning one item plus another in lists). Excludes rare idioms only loosely related to literal togetherness, and advanced legal or academic formulae.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - How do you say that people are in the same place or doing something at the same time (sit together, live together, travel together)?
     - How do you say that one person or thing is *included together with* another in an action, group, or list (together with, along with, as well as)?
     - How do you avoid common grammar mistakes when combining subjects, objects, and verbs with *together with* and similar expressions?
     - How can you vary the tone from simple everyday speech to slightly more formal ways of saying "together with"?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Meaning focus**: physical proximity (in the same place), joint action (doing something together), inclusion/adding (X together with Y), mention/listing (X, together with Y and Z).
     - **Grammar role**: verb + together, phrasal/prepositional pattern (together with, along with, in combination with), coordination with and, as well as.
     - **Register**: neutral everyday (together, with), slightly formal (together with, along with), academic/formal (in conjunction with, in combination with).
     - **Error risks**: subject–verb agreement with *together with*, redundant combinations (together with with), and unclear grouping in lists.

1. Q: Essence card – Core meaning of "together" vs "with"
   A:
   - **Label**: Core meaning of "together" vs "with"
   - **Core Idea**: *Together* highlights people or things being in the same place or doing the same action at the same time, while *with* simply shows connection; *together with* combines both ideas: being linked and treated as one unit.
   - **Why It Matters**: Learners often overuse *with* and underuse *together*, losing the sense of shared activity; knowing when to add *together* makes descriptions of joint actions and group situations clearer and more natural.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Meaning focus = physical proximity & joint action; Grammar role = adverb (together) vs preposition phrase (with / together with).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - together
     - with
     - together with

1. Q: Essence card – Talking about doing things together
   A:
   - **Label**: Talking about doing things together
   - **Core Idea**: High-frequency patterns like *do something together*, *live together*, *work together*, *travel together*, *study together* give you a simple, productive way to show shared actions without complex grammar.
   - **Why It Matters**: Being able to say who did what *together* is basic for conversations about relationships, teamwork, travel, and daily routines; without these patterns, learners fall back on long, unnatural sentences.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Meaning focus = joint action; Grammar role = verb + adverb (together); Register = neutral everyday speech.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - work together
     - live together
     - study together

1. Q: Essence card – "Together with" and "along with" for inclusion
   A:
   - **Label**: "Together with" and "along with" for inclusion
   - **Core Idea**: Phrases like *together with*, *along with*, and *as well as* let you add one person or thing to another in the same action or situation, often used in more careful or formal speech and writing.
   - **Why It Matters**: These patterns are key when you need to mention a main item plus others ("The manager, together with her team, presented the plan"), or when you want to sound more formal than just using *and* everywhere.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Meaning focus = inclusion/adding; Grammar role = prepositional phrase following a noun or subject; Register = neutral to formal.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - together with
     - along with
     - as well as

1. Q: Essence card – Subject–verb agreement with "together with"
   A:
   - **Label**: Subject–verb agreement with "together with"
   - **Core Idea**: In English, when *together with* (or *along with*, *as well as*) comes after the main subject, the verb usually agrees with the main subject, not the extra phrase ("The teacher, together with her students, is...").
   - **Why It Matters**: Many learners wrongly make the verb plural because they see two nouns; this is a high-risk error in exams and formal writing, so understanding which noun controls the verb is decision-critical.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Grammar role = subject–verb agreement; Error risks = exam writing, formal emails.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - subject–verb agreement
     - together with

1. Q: Essence card – Avoiding redundancy and confusion in lists
   A:
   - **Label**: Avoiding redundancy and confusion in lists
   - **Core Idea**: When you use *together with* or similar phrases in lists, you must avoid repeating *with* and be clear about which items are grouped ("X, together with Y and Z"), otherwise the sentence becomes confusing or ungrammatical.
   - **Why It Matters**: Poorly structured *together with* lists create ambiguity in contracts, reports, and instructions; mastering one or two safe patterns prevents messy sentences like "*together with with*" or unclear groupings.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Meaning focus = mention/listing; Grammar role = coordination and punctuation; Register = written communication.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - coordination
     - and
     - together with

1. Q: Essence card – Choosing register: simple "with" vs formal alternatives
   A:
   - **Label**: Choosing register: simple "with" vs formal alternatives
   - **Core Idea**: For most everyday speech, *together*, *with*, and *together with* are enough, but in more formal or technical contexts you may choose phrases like *in conjunction with* or *in combination with* to sound more professional.
   - **Why It Matters**: Register mistakes (using very formal phrases in casual talk, or only casual *with* in formal writing) can make language sound odd; knowing a small, clear set of alternatives lets you adjust tone without learning long lists.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Register = neutral vs formal; Context = everyday conversation vs academic/business writing.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - in conjunction with
     - in combination with
     - together with
