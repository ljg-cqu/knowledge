### Q1: Selecting core "together" patterns for a beginner lesson

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher designing an A2 lesson on doing things together  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Teacher, Students] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are preparing a 20-minute lesson called "Doing things together" for an A2 group. The course book suggests many phrases: *be together*, *spend time together*, *hang out together*, *go out together*, *live together*, *work together*, *study together*, *together with friends*, plus dozens of unrelated social idioms. Students usually remember only 8–12 items from a short lesson.

From this situation:  
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should drive which "together" patterns you actually teach.  
2. Group these levers into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how you will measure success** and which expressions you will consciously de-prioritize or ignore for now.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core verb + together patterns that transfer (work/study/live/travel together).  
  - One or two simple relationship phrases (be together, spend time together).  
  - A clear contrast between *together* vs just *with* ("I live with my parents" vs "We live together").  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Shared actions**: simple verb + together patterns for daily life (work, study, travel).  
  - **Relationships & time**: be together, spend time together to talk about couples, friends, and family.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters give students building blocks to describe who does what with whom, instead of learning many one-off social idioms.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Success = each learner can produce 3–5 correct sentences like "I study together with my friend" or "We work together in the same office". Teach shared actions first, then relationship/time phrases.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Trying to cover every suggested phrase, including niche idioms.  
  - Not highlighting the meaning difference between *together* and plain *with*.

### Q2: Handling subject–verb agreement with "together with" in exam writing

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Exam-prep teacher for B2 writing  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: [Teacher, Students, Exam marker] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Your B2 exam students like to write complex subjects such as "*The manager, together with her team, have decided...*" or "*The teacher, along with some students, are planning...*". Markers often penalize them for subject–verb agreement errors. You want to teach a small set of patterns that let students sound advanced **without** increasing the risk of mistakes.

From this situation:  
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should guide how you handle *together with* and similar phrases in exam writing.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for your short grammar explanation and practice.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Rule: the verb agrees with the main subject before *together with/along with/as well as*.  
  - One or two safe model sentences that students can copy.  
  - A simple alternative: use *and* with plural verbs instead of risky extra phrases when unsure.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Agreement rule & models**: show "The manager, together with her team, **is**" and "The teacher, along with some students, **has**" with clear highlighting of the main subject.  
  - **Safe simplification**: recommend "The manager and her team **have** decided" when students want to avoid complex commas and phrases.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: subject–verb agreement with *together with/along with/as well as*. Out-of-scope: full list of linking phrases or advanced punctuation rules.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters tell students when to use or avoid *together with* so they keep marks instead of losing them.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: treating everything before the verb as a plural subject; mixing *together with* and *and* in the same subject.

### Q3: Clarifying "together with" vs "and" in business reports

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Business analyst writing internal reports  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Analyst, Manager, Colleagues] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You write a status report that includes sentences like "*Sales of product A, together with strong online marketing, increased profits*" and "*These changes, together with higher costs, affected our results*". Some readers tell you these sentences feel unclear: they are not sure which things are grouped, and which are causes vs results. You want to use a small number of patterns that keep the idea of "A together with B" but make the logic obvious.

From this situation:  
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape how you use *together with* vs *and* in such reports.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and label each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster changes your concrete sentence patterns**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Use *A and B* when both are simple subjects doing the same action.  
  - Use *A, together with B,* mainly to add a secondary, supporting element to a main subject.  
  - Avoid long, mixed lists where readers cannot see what belongs together.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Simple coordination**: turn many "together with" cases into "A and B" subjects ("Sales and strong online marketing increased profits").  
  - **Highlight main vs extra**: when you really need emphasis, use "Sales of product A, together with stronger online marketing, **led to** higher profits" but keep it short and follow with a clearer breakdown in the next sentence.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide when you keep or drop *together with* so that cause–effect and grouping stay readable, cutting the risk of misinterpretation in business decisions.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Aim to reduce unclear sentences flagged by reviewers; prefer coordination unless there is a strong reason to mark one item as "extra".  
- **Common Failure Modes**: mixing causes and results in one long "together with" sentence; piling three or more items around the phrase.

### Q4: Setting scope for a "Together with & addition" vocabulary page in an app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ScopeBoundaries, SignalVsNoise] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Content designer for a vocabulary-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Content designer, PM, Learners] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Your app already has general pages for *and* and *also*. You now plan a small module called "Together with & addition" focused on adding people/things to an action in slightly more advanced ways. A colleague suggests many phrases: *together with*, *along with*, *as well as*, *in conjunction with*, *in combination with*, plus long academic chunks like *in collaboration with* and *in association with*. You can only include about 15 key items in this module.

From this situation:  
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that define what belongs inside this "Together with & addition" page (and what should stay under simple *and/also* or advanced academic pages).  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **which phrases you would explicitly exclude or move elsewhere**, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday inclusion phrases that directly extend "and": *together with*, *along with*, *as well as*.  
  - One or two formal pairing phrases: *in conjunction with*, *in combination with*.  
  - Clear link back to simpler addition words (*and, also*) so learners see relationships, not a random list.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Core inclusion phrases**: focus the page on *together with*, *along with*, *as well as* with many examples and contrast with plain *and*.  
  - **Formal variants**: add a small, clearly-labelled corner for *in conjunction with* and *in combination with* for business/academic use.  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: phrases that mean roughly "and/plus" with a flavor of "together". Out-of-scope: very specific collaboration phrases (*in collaboration with, in association with*) and any idioms whose meaning is not literal addition; those go into separate pages on cooperation or idioms.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters keep the module teachable and coherent, making "together with" feel like a focused extension of basic addition vocabulary rather than a bag of advanced expressions.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: dumping all "formal-sounding" phrases into one page; not drawing hard lines between simple addition and specialized collaboration language.
