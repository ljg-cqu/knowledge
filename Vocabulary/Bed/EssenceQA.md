### Q1: Choosing core bed vocabulary for a short lesson

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher in a general English course  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: ESL teacher, B1 learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are preparing a 15-minute lesson called "In the bedroom" for a B1 class. The textbook page lists more than 40 words, including detailed furniture vocabulary and several rare idioms about sleep. You know that most students only remember 10–15 new items per lesson.  
From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should drive which bed-and-sleep words you actually teach.  
2. Group these levers into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how you will measure success** for this lesson and which vocabulary you would consciously de-prioritize or ignore for now.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core bed objects and bedding (bed, mattress, pillow, sheet, blanket, bedding).  
  - Basic sleep actions and routines (go to bed, fall asleep, wake up, get out of bed, take a nap).  
  - Sleep quality adjectives (comfortable/uncomfortable, tired, sleepy).  
  - (Optional) Simple problem phrases (have trouble sleeping, sleep badly).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Physical setup**: concrete nouns that let learners point to and name things in a bedroom.  
  - **Routines and feelings**: verbs and adjectives that let them describe what they do and how they feel.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters cover almost all everyday talk about beds and sleep at B1; details like "king-size bed frame" or rare idioms can wait.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Success = each learner can describe their bed and bedtime routine in 4–6 sentences using at least 2 nouns, 2 verbs, and 1 adjective. Teach physical setup first, then routines and feelings.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Trying to cover the full 40-word list and overwhelming students.  
  - Spending time on low-frequency idioms instead of core items.  
  - Mixing too many similar synonyms without clear priorities.

### Q2: Structuring hotel bed vocabulary for marketing copy

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Copywriter for a boutique hotel website  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Marketing manager, Hotel GM, Guests, SEO specialist | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You must write a short paragraph describing the beds in a new boutique hotel. Internal notes list dozens of features: king-size beds, orthopedic mattresses, hypoallergenic pillows, blackout curtains, quiet rooms, luxurious bedding, and more. The page must stay under 80 words and focus on what affects booking decisions.  
From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** for bed-and-sleep vocabulary that truly influence a guest's decision to book.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster connects to booking decisions or review scores.**

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Bed size and quality (king-size/queen-size beds, premium mattresses).  
  - Sleep comfort items (hypoallergenic pillows, soft yet supportive bedding).  
  - Sleep environment (quiet rooms, blackout curtains).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Bed hardware**: bed size and mattress quality—key for comfort and perceived value.  
  - **Soft furnishings**: pillows and bedding that signal luxury and cleanliness.  
  - **Sleep environment**: noise level and light control that enable "a good night's sleep".  
- **Decision Link**: Guests decide based on whether they expect to sleep well; these clusters map directly to "comfortable bed" and "great sleep" review phrases, which drive ratings and repeat bookings.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize words that support metrics like average review score for "bed comfort" and "sleep quality". Lead with hardware, then furnishings, then environment.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Listing decorative details (headboard style, color scheme) instead of sleep-critical features.  
  - Mixing unrelated ideas into one long sentence with no clear structure.  
  - Overusing adjectives like "luxurious" without linking them to concrete bed features.

### Q3: Setting scope for a "Bed & Sleep" vocabulary page

**EssenceDimensions**: [ScopeBoundaries, SignalVsNoise] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Content writer for a language-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Action, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: Content writer, Curriculum lead, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Your team is building a single "Bed & Sleep" vocabulary page in a mobile app. Other pages already cover "Health problems" and "Hotel check-in". A colleague proposes adding snoring, jet lag, sleep apnea, and detailed hotel phrases to this page. Space is limited to about 25 words and expressions.  
From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 levers** that define what belongs inside the scope of a "Bed & Sleep" vocabulary page.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and label each cluster.  
3. Explain **which topics you would explicitly exclude** and where they should go instead.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core bedroom objects and bedding.  
  - Bedtime routines and basic sleep actions.  
  - Simple descriptions of sleep quality (sleep well/badly, be exhausted).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Bedroom basics**: words for things near the bed (bed, mattress, pillow, sheets, blanket, bedding, bedside table).  
  - **Routines and quality**: verbs and phrases for going to bed, waking up, and describing how you slept.  
- **Decision Link**: This scope makes the page coherent and learnable in one sitting; advanced health conditions and complex travel issues belong elsewhere.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Aim for high completion and retention rates for 20–25 items, measured by quiz scores and reuse in speaking tasks. Put bedroom basics first, then routines and quality.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Letting the page drift into general health problems (sleep apnea, snoring) instead of vocabulary around the bed itself.  
  - Mixing detailed hotel service phrases that fit better under "Hotel check-in".  
  - Treating the page as a dumping ground for every sleep-related word.

### Q4: Prioritizing sleep-related vocabulary for behavior change

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Health coach designing English materials for clients' sleep habits  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Health coach, Clients, Doctor/therapist | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are creating a short English handout for clients who want to improve their sleep. They already know basic words like bed and pillow. You have space for 10–12 key expressions that help them talk about habits that harm or help their sleep (e.g., stay up late, scroll in bed, have a bedtime routine, get enough sleep). The handout must directly support behavior change and simple conversations with a doctor or coach.  
From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** in bed-and-sleep vocabulary that most strongly affect clients' sleep behavior.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **which metrics** you would track to see if these levers are working.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Bedtime and wake-up consistency (go to bed at the same time, get up at the same time, stay up late).  
  - In-bed behaviors (scroll in bed, watch TV in bed, read in bed, lights out).  
  - Sleep sufficiency and quality (get enough sleep, sleep well/badly, feel rested or exhausted).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - **Schedule**: words that describe when you go to bed and wake up.  
  - **In-bed habits**: what you do in bed before trying to sleep.  
  - **Outcomes**: how much and how well you sleep, and how you feel the next day.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters map directly to behavior-change conversations: adjust schedule, clean up in-bed habits, then monitor outcomes.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track average bedtime and wake-up time, hours of sleep, and number of days per week clients report "sleeping well" or "feeling rested". Start by stabilizing schedule, then reduce negative in-bed habits, then fine-tune.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Focusing on advanced medical terms instead of simple habit language.  
  - Teaching too many low-impact synonyms instead of a few clear expressions clients can actually use.  
  - Ignoring measurable outcomes when choosing vocabulary.
