# Blockchain Vocabulary: Prepositions

1. **Preposition**: on (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial/Abstract)* Indicating location or position within a blockchain network or platform
   - *(Technical)* Denoting where data, contracts, or transactions exist or execute within blockchain infrastructure
   
   **Synonyms**: within (in context X), upon, atop, inside
   
   **Antonyms**: off, outside, external to, off-chain
   
   **When to Use**: When describing location of data, smart contracts, or transactions within blockchain networks. Extremely common in blockchain discourse.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when referring to off-chain data or external systems. Avoid confusion between "on Bitcoin" (the network) vs. "on-chain" (recorded).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: on the blockchain, on Ethereum, on-chain, on mainnet
   - **Verb + prep**: deploy on, build on, run on, store on
   - **Adjective + prep**: built on, based on, recorded on
   - **Noun + prep**: transaction on, contract on, data on
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "on" (in/at/upon)
