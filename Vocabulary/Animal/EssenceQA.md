## Q1: Designing a beginner “Animals” unit for ESL learners

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher planning a beginner Animals unit  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: ESL teacher, Students | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are teaching an A2-level adult class. The textbook’s Animals unit proposes over 25 new words: mammal, reptile, amphibian, predator, prey, carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, habitat, territory, camouflage, migration, extinction, endangered, biodiversity, conservation status, nocturnal, domesticated, etc.  
You have only one 45-minute lesson before a short writing task where students must describe one animal in 5–6 sentences. Past classes complained that “there are too many words” and then used only dog, cat, big, small in their writing.  
Your curriculum lead asks you to keep just **10–12 truly essential concepts** for the core unit and move everything else to optional extension.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape your reduced word list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what you will consciously de-prioritize or ignore** in this lesson, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core classification labels (mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insect) so students can answer “What kind of animal is it?”  
  - Basic diet and role words (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore; predator, prey) to describe who eats what.  
  - Simple habitat terms (habitat, wild/domesticated) so learners can say where animals live.  
  - One risk concept (endangered) to support common exam topics about protection.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Classification*: mammal / bird / reptile / fish / insect.  
  - *Food chain roles*: carnivore / herbivore / omnivore / predator / prey.  
  - *Place & risk*: habitat, wild/domesticated, endangered.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters define which 10–12 words enter the core unit and which move to extension (biodiversity, conservation status, nocturnal). They maximize students’ ability to write “X is a Y that lives in Z and eats W.”  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Start with classification, then diet, then habitat. Success metrics: in a 5-sentence paragraph, ≥80% of students correctly use ≥3 of the target concepts.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Trying to cover all 25+ words, leaving students with shallow recall.  
  - Focusing on rare terms like biodiversity instead of high-frequency building blocks.

## Q2: Structuring a predator–prey documentary segment

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Scriptwriter for a wildlife documentary segment  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: Scriptwriter, Producer, Wildlife biologist | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are writing a 5-minute segment on wolves and deer for a prime-time wildlife documentary. Scientist notes mention: trophic levels, apex predator, herd behavior, camouflage, seasonal migration, habitat fragmentation, carrying capacity, extinction risk, hunting regulations, and local indigenous perspectives.  
The producer complains that earlier drafts “sound like a biology lecture,” while the biologist worries that cutting terms like predator, prey, and habitat will “water down the science.”  
You must decide which **few core ideas and words** will structure the voice-over, knowing viewers have limited attention.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should anchor the segment’s vocabulary and story.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that a non-expert audience can follow.  
3. Explain how each cluster **drives concrete script decisions** (what to say, what to leave out).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Predator–prey relationship (wolves as predators, deer as prey).  
  - Habitat and habitat fragmentation.  
  - Population balance and carrying capacity.  
  - Risk vocabulary (endangered / extinction risk kept only if genuinely relevant).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Food chain roles*: predator, prey, apex predator; explains who eats whom.  
  - *Place & pressure*: habitat, habitat fragmentation, carrying capacity; shows where they live and what pressures they face.  
  - Optionally *Human context*: hunting regulations and local perspectives, if time allows.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which explanations and shots you script: visuals of hunting, maps of fragmented forest, simple lines like “When predators disappear, prey populations explode and habitats suffer.” Technical terms like trophic level or detailed regulation codes are noise for a 5-minute segment.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize clusters by: first food chain roles, then place & pressure, then human context. Success metrics: viewer recall of predator, prey, and habitat in post-show surveys.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Mixing too many technical terms without clear buckets.  
  - Cutting core words like habitat while keeping minor jargon.

## Q3: Condensing migration & adaptation for park signage

**EssenceDimensions**: [MetricsPriorities, SignalVsNoise] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Education officer at a national park  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Education officer, Visitors, Park rangers | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
A wetland reserve wants three outdoor panels explaining bird migration and adaptations. Draft text from scientists includes: migration, seasonal routes, stopover sites, adaptation, camouflage, offspring survival, climate change, wind patterns, tagging data, GPS tracking, flight speed, and species names for 15 different birds.  
You have strict limits: each panel must be read in under 45 seconds by a casual visitor with children. The director insists on “at least some numbers” and “one simple story to remember.”

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should shape which animal concepts and numbers you keep.  
2. Group them into **2–3 clusters** suitable for three clear panels.  
3. Explain which details you will **downgrade or drop** (noise) and how you will measure whether visitors got the point.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Migration as a repeated seasonal journey between two main habitats.  
  - Key adaptations (camouflage, wing shape, fat storage) that make the journey possible.  
  - One or two simple, memorable numbers (distance and number of species that migrate).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Journey*: migration, seasonal routes, a single flagship species as example.  
  - *Survival tools*: adaptations like camouflage and energy storage.  
  - *Why it matters now*: climate change impact on timing and offspring survival.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide panel titles (“The Journey”, “Built for the Trip”, “New Challenges”) and which terms appear in large print. You intentionally drop most species names, GPS technicalities, and flight-speed trivia as noise.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize journey then survival tools; climate change gets one simple panel. Metrics: short visitor survey asking them to recall (1) what migration is, (2) one adaptation, (3) one number (for example, “up to 5,000 km”).  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Stuffing panels with species lists and device jargon.  
  - No clear numeric anchors, making migration feel abstract.

## Q4: Framing a conservation funding pitch

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Conservation NGO analyst preparing a donor briefing  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: NGO analyst, Donor, Field biologists, Local community | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You must brief a non-technical donor on why to fund work in a coastal region. Field reports mention: endangered sea turtles, nesting beaches (habitat), predation on eggs, fishing nets (bycatch), migration routes, offspring survival rates, and long-term extinction risk.  
There are also 20 pages of background on local politics, tourism, school programs, and minor species. The donor has 15 minutes and wants “three reasons to fund this now” plus “two or three simple animal facts I can repeat.”

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that tie animal vocabulary (species, habitat, predators, offspring, extinction) directly to the funding decision.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map cleanly to slide sections.  
3. Propose **1–3 simple metrics** and a priority order for presenting them.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Species status (endangered sea turtles vs other animals).  
  - Critical habitat (nesting beaches) and main threats (predators, bycatch).  
  - Offspring survival and projected extinction risk.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Who*: endangered sea turtle species and why they matter.  
  - *Where & threats*: nesting habitat, predators, fishing nets.  
  - *Future if we act vs not*: offspring survival rates and extinction probability.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive the story of “protect nests, reduce bycatch, increase hatchling survival,” each mapping to a budget line. Local politics and tourism become backdrop, not core sections.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize (1) current hatchling survival (% of eggs reaching sea), (2) expected survival after intervention, (3) years to functional extinction if nothing changes. The order is species → habitat/threat → survival impact.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Spending time on every animal and program instead of the flagship species.  
  - Using vague language (“very threatened”) instead of extinction and survival metrics.

## Q5: Defining the “Animals” module for a vocab-learning app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a language-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: PM, Curriculum designer, Engineers, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are scoping the Animals module of an English vocabulary app. Content designers propose 300+ words: basic pets, farm animals, wild animals, advanced biology (vertebrate, invertebrate, adaptation, camouflage, instinct), rare species names, idioms (“a dark horse”), and culture references (zodiac animals).  
Engineering can only support ~60–80 core items in the first release. Marketing wants “fun animal cards,” while curriculum designers argue for science-accurate terms like predator, habitat, extinction.  
You must define **what is in vs out of scope** for version 1.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should define the Animals module’s scope.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map to learning paths.  
3. State clearly what you will **exclude or push to later** and why (scope boundaries).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday animals learners actually talk about (pets, common farm and zoo animals).  
  - Core descriptive patterns built from a small concept set (species group, habitat, diet, one risk term).  
  - Transferable science words (mammal, predator, prey, habitat, extinction) that appear in exams and media.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Everyday communication*: dog, cat, cow, horse, etc., with simple adjectives (wild/domestic, big/small).  
  - *Science basics*: mammal / bird / reptile / fish / insect; carnivore / herbivore / omnivore; predator / prey; habitat; endangered.  
  - Optional future *Culture & idioms*: zodiac animals, idioms, rare species names.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which ~60–80 cards ship: mix of high-frequency everyday and high-leverage science terms that enable sentences like “Tigers are endangered predators that live in forests.” Idioms and rare species move to a later “Fun & culture” pack.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize retention and usage of science basics in learner output; success metrics include % of learners correctly using at least three Animal concepts in writing/speaking tasks.  
- **Common Failure Modes**:  
  - Letting “fun” rare animals crowd out core concepts.  
  - Failing to draw hard scope lines, leading to a bloated, unfocused module.
