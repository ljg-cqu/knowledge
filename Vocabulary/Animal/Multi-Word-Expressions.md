1. **Expression**: food chain (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A hierarchical series of organisms each dependent on the next as a source of food; a linear sequence showing who eats whom in an ecosystem.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: trophic chain, feeding hierarchy
   
   **Antonyms**: food web (more complex, interconnected)
   
   **When to Use**: Ecology discussions, explaining predator-prey relationships, educational contexts, discussing energy flow through ecosystems.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing complex interconnected feeding relationships (use "food web" instead for accuracy).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - aquatic food chain
   - marine food chain
   - terrestrial food chain
   - top of the food chain
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Food" and "chain" combine naturally because feeding relationships create linked sequences like chain links, with each organism connected to the next in a linear progression.
   
   **Root Analysis**: food (Old English) + chain (Latin catena = chain)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Lions are at the top of the food chain—nothing hunts them.
   - Every animal has a place in the food chain, from tiny insects to huge predators.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - apex predator species
   - apex marine predator
   - apex terrestrial predator
   - role as apex predator
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Apex" (meaning peak/top) naturally pairs with "predator" to specify the highest-level hunter in an ecosystem, creating a precise ecological term.
   
   **Root Analysis**: apex (Latin = peak, top) + predator (Latin praeda = prey)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Sharks are apex predators in the ocean—they have no natural enemies.
   - As an apex predator, the wolf plays a crucial role in controlling deer populations.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Apex predators regulate prey populations through top-down trophic control mechanisms.
   - The removal of apex predators from ecosystems often results in mesopredator release and cascading effects.
