1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Animal vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: Provide a compact set of core animal-related concepts and terms that let you describe animals, their classification, behavior, environments, and conservation clearly in English.
   - **Scope**: Focus on high-leverage vocabulary for talking about animals as living organisms in nature (wildlife, ecology, behavior, conservation), not on pets-as-products, idioms, or detailed internal anatomy.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When you talk about an animal, what basic concepts (type, diet, body structure) do you need first?
     - How do you describe where animals live and how they interact with their environment?
     - How do you explain what animals do (behavior, movement, life cycle) in simple but precise language?
     - How do you talk about threats to animals and why some species are in trouble?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - Biological classification (type, body structure, vertebrate vs invertebrate, species)
     - Diet and ecological role (herbivore / carnivore / omnivore; predator vs prey; trophic level)
     - Habitat and movement (habitat, territory, migration, camouflage)
     - Life cycle, behavior, and conservation status (offspring, instinct, adaptation, extinction)
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - Species: A group of similar animals that can breed together and have fertile offspring.
     - Habitat: The natural place where an animal normally lives and finds food and shelter.
     - Predator: An animal that hunts and eats other animals.
     - Prey: An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator.
     - Carnivore: An animal that eats mainly meat.
     - Herbivore: An animal that eats mainly plants.
     - Adaptation: A physical or behavioral feature that helps an animal survive in its environment.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Biology basics; Ecosystems & food chains; General nature vocabulary.
     - **Siblings**: Plant vocabulary; Environment & climate vocabulary; Body parts (animals & humans).
     - **Downstream**: Wildlife conservation writing; Animal behavior case studies; Exam tasks about environment and biodiversity.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: Blocks, Roles
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: English learners, science students, teachers, test-prep writers, content creators.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen

1. Q: Essence card – Classification backbone
   A:
   - **Label**: Classification backbone – species & major groups
   - **Core Idea**: A small set of terms for species and major animal groups (mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insect; vertebrate vs invertebrate) gives you a backbone for describing any animal in one clear sentence.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without these words you cannot answer basic questions like "What kind of animal is it?" or distinguish scientific from casual descriptions, which blocks clear explanations in exams, reports, or documentaries.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Biological classification; Usage context = academic vs everyday speech
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - species, mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insect, vertebrate, invertebrate

1. Q: Essence card – Diet & trophic roles
   A:
   - **Label**: Diet & trophic roles – who eats whom
   - **Core Idea**: The trio carnivore / herbivore / omnivore plus predator and prey lets you quickly describe an animal's place in the food chain and how energy flows through an ecosystem.
   - **Why It Matters**: These terms are central whenever you talk about food webs, population balance, or ecosystem change; choosing the wrong word (for example, calling an omnivore a carnivore) creates factual errors that weaken arguments and lessons.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Diet & ecological role; Level of technicality = basic science
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, predator, prey

1. Q: Essence card – Habitat & movement
   A:
   - **Label**: Habitat, territory & movement patterns
   - **Core Idea**: Words like habitat, territory, migration, and camouflage let you explain where animals live, how they move between places, and how they stay safe or hidden.
   - **Why It Matters**: These concepts are key to talking about environmental change, human impact, and animal survival strategies; without them you can only give vague descriptions like "they live there" or "they move a lot."
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Habitat & movement; Conservation focus = neutral to high
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - habitat, territory, migration, camouflage

1. Q: Essence card – Life cycle & behavior
   A:
   - **Label**: Life cycle, instinct & adaptation
   - **Core Idea**: Offspring, instinct, and adaptation give you compact language for how animals are born, grow, and behave without being taught, and how species change over time to fit their environments.
   - **Why It Matters**: These terms support explanations of evolution, parenting, and survival; they help you connect individual behavior to long-term change, which is often tested in school or needed in public communication.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Life cycle & behavior; Time scale = short-term behavior vs long-term evolution
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - offspring, instinct, adaptation

1. Q: Essence card – Risk & conservation
   A:
   - **Label**: Risk, extinction & conservation status
   - **Core Idea**: Extinction and endangered-species vocabulary lets you talk precisely about how close animals are to disappearing and why urgent action may be needed.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many real-world texts, exams, and news stories about animals focus on risk and protection; using the right terms signals you understand not just the animals themselves but the human responsibilities around them.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Conservation status & human impact; Communication goal = explain risk clearly
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - endangered species, extinction, conservation
