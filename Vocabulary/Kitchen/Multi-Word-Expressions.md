   - Beat the eggs with a fork before adding them to the pan.

   - *For collocations*: "Pre-" (before) + "heat" forms a compound verb specifically for the oven-warming step; this word emerged with modern oven technology requiring warm-up time before use
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "prae-" (before) + Old English "hǣtan" (to heat)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don't forget to preheat the oven before you start mixing!

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Rest" metaphorically applies human need for rest to meat; became standard culinary language because it clearly communicates the waiting period; "let" indicates allowing/permitting this natural process
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "lǣtan" (let, allow) + "rest" (Old English "ræst")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let the steak rest for about 5 minutes before you cut it.
   - Don't cut into it yet—let it rest first or all the juices will run out!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - diced onions
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Dice" derives from the cube shape of gaming dice; became a precise culinary term for cube-shaped cuts; collocates with ingredients that are commonly cut this way (onions, tomatoes, peppers)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old French "dé" (dice, die) → became verb for cutting into dice-shapes
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Dice the onions pretty small for this recipe.
   - Just dice everything up and throw it in the pot.

   - *For collocations*: "Reduce" (make less) naturally pairs with "heat" (temperature); this became standard culinary language because it's more precise than "turn down" and matches professional terminology
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "reducere" (bring back, diminish) + Old English "hǣtu" (heat)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low.
   - Reduce the heat or it's gonna burn!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
   - Whisk it all together until there are no lumps.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
