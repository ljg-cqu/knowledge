# Kitchen Functional Language

1. **Functional Expression**: Could you help me with [task]? (function: requesting assistance)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite way to ask someone to assist you with a cooking or kitchen task
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: indirect (using modal "could" softens the request)
   
   **Synonyms**: Would you mind helping me with...?, Can you give me a hand with...?, I could use some help with...
   
   **Antonyms**: I'll do it myself, Don't help me with...
   
   **When to Use**: When you need assistance in the kitchen, when collaborating on meal preparation, when teaching someone to cook
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the task is very simple and requesting help seems excessive, in professional kitchens where direct commands are standard
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Could you give me a hand with this?
   - Would you mind helping me chop these vegetables?
   - Can you help me carry this pot?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Using "could" instead of "can" adds politeness; the question form makes it feel less like a command and preserves the helper's autonomy
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Sure, what do you need? / Of course, I'd be happy to
   - Sorry, I'm in the middle of something right now
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**:

   - That's okay, no problem / Don't worry about it
   - Is there an alternative? / What can we do instead?
