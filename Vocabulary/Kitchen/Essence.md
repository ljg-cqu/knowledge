1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Kitchen vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: Provide a compact set of core kitchen-related concepts and terms so you can describe common kitchen spaces, tools, actions, hygiene, and safety clearly in everyday English.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on vocabulary for a typical home or shared kitchen (layout, appliances, utensils, cooking and cleaning actions, basic safety and hygiene). Excludes detailed cooking techniques, recipes, professional chef jargon, and restaurant service language (handled in more specialized notes).
   - **Central Questions**:
     - Which few words let you quickly describe what is in a kitchen and where things are?
     - How do you talk about basic cooking and cleaning actions in the kitchen?
     - How do you describe the condition of food and surfaces (raw vs cooked, clean vs dirty, fresh vs spoiled, hot vs cold)?
     - How do you talk about simple kitchen safety and hygiene so people avoid accidents and food poisoning?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Space & zones**: layout and areas (counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard, pantry).
     - **Tools & appliances**: hand tools and machines (knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, microwave, blender).
     - **Actions & processes**: cooking and cleaning verbs (boil, fry, bake, chop, mix, wash, rinse, wipe, throw away).
     - **States, hygiene & safety**: condition and risk (raw/cooked, fresh/spoiled, clean/dirty, hot/cold, sharp/slippery).
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Counter*: A flat surface in the kitchen where you prepare food.

1. Q: Essence card – Layout & key kitchen zones
   A:
   - **Label**: Layout & key kitchen zones
   - **Core Idea**: A small set of words for the main parts of a kitchen (counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard, pantry) lets you quickly say where things are and where actions happen.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without these zone words, it is hard to give or follow instructions like “Put it on the counter,” “Wash it in the sink,” or “Take it out of the oven,” which blocks clear communication in homes, shared kitchens, or rentals.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Space & zones; Usage context = giving directions / describing place.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard, shelf, pantry

1. Q: Essence card – Core tools & utensils
   A:
   - **Label**: Core tools & utensils for everyday tasks
   - **Core Idea**: Words for a small set of common kitchen tools and utensils (knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, fork, plate, bowl, mug, spatula) cover most daily cooking and eating situations.
   - **Why It Matters**: These words let you ask for, offer, and describe what you need (“Pass me the knife,” “Use the cutting board,” “Put it in the bowl”), which is essential in shared kitchens, lessons, and service situations.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Tools & appliances; Task type = preparing vs serving vs eating.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, fork, plate, bowl, mug, spatula

1. Q: Essence card – Cooking actions & heat control
   A:
   - **Label**: Cooking actions & heat control
   - **Core Idea**: A basic verb set (boil, fry, bake, roast, grill, steam, chop, mix, stir, preheat, simmer) plus simple heat words (low heat, medium heat, high heat) lets you follow or give almost any simple recipe.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many instructions in the kitchen are about *how* to change food: what action to use and how hot to make it. If you do not know these words, you cannot understand recipes, cooking shows, or safety advice (“Don’t leave the pan on high heat”).
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Actions & processes; Heat level = low / medium / high.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - boil, fry, bake, roast, grill, steam, chop, slice, mix, stir, preheat, simmer

1. Q: Essence card – Cleaning & hygiene basics
   A:
   - **Label**: Cleaning & hygiene basics
   - **Core Idea**: Verbs and nouns like wash, rinse, wipe, scrub, dry, soap, sponge, dishcloth, trash/garbage let you describe how to keep dishes, surfaces, and the kitchen area clean.
   - **Why It Matters**: Clear hygiene language supports simple but important rules (“Wash your hands,” “Rinse the dishes,” “Wipe the counter,” “Throw it in the trash”), which reduce conflict in shared spaces and lower the risk of illness from dirty dishes or surfaces.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Actions & processes; States, hygiene & safety.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - wash, rinse, wipe, scrub, dry, soap, sponge, dishcloth, trash, garbage, bin

1. Q: Essence card – Food state, temperature & safety
   A:
   - **Label**: Food state, temperature & safety
   - **Core Idea**: Pairs of opposite words (raw/cooked, fresh/spoiled, hot/cold, clean/dirty) plus safety words (sharp, slippery, spill, burn) let you describe risk and condition in the kitchen in very simple sentences.
   - **Why It Matters**: These terms are central for warnings and checks (“The pan is very hot,” “The milk is spoiled,” “The floor is slippery,” “Be careful, the knife is sharp”). Without them, you cannot give quick, clear safety or hygiene messages.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: States, hygiene & safety; Time = before / during / after cooking.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - raw, cooked, fresh, spoiled, hot, warm, cold, clean, dirty, sharp, slippery, spill, burn
