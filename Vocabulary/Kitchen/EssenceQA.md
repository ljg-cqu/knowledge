## Q1: Choosing core words for a beginner “In the kitchen” lesson

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: ESL teacher planning a beginner kitchen vocabulary lesson  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: ESL teacher, Students | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You teach an A2-level class. The textbook suggests 30+ new words for one unit: counter, cupboard, pantry, fridge, freezer, microwave, blender, kettle, toaster, cutting board, pot, pan, spatula, whisk, grater, ladle, tongs, measuring cup, chopping board, stove, oven, etc. You only have one 45-minute lesson before a short speaking task where students must describe their kitchen and say how they cook something simple. Past students remembered only *kitchen*, *fridge*, *knife*, and *plate* after similar units. Your course lead asks you to keep **10–12 truly essential concepts** for the core lesson and move the rest to optional extension.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape which kitchen words stay in the core list.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **what vocabulary you will consciously de-prioritize or drop** in this first lesson, and why.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core zones so students can say where things are (counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard).  
  - Core tools for daily use (knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, plate, bowl).  
  - One or two action or safety words that appear in tasks (cook, wash, hot).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Where things are (Zones)*: counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard – enough to describe a simple layout.  
  - *What you use (Tools)*: knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, plate, bowl – basic preparation and eating.  
  - Optional *Actions & safety*: cook, wash, hot, if time allows.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which 10–12 words become the “must know” set, so students can say “In my kitchen, there is a stove, a sink, and a fridge. I cook in a pan and wash dishes in the sink.” Less frequent tools (whisk, tongs, grater, measuring cup) move to extension.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize zones first, then tools. Success metric: in a short oral task, ≥80% of students correctly use at least three zone words and two tool words.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Trying to cover every utensil; spending time on rare tools instead of everyday items.

## Q2: Structuring a kitchen-verb cheat sheet for recipe instructions

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Content designer for a beginner-friendly recipe app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: Content designer, Developer, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are creating a “Basic Kitchen Verbs” help sheet inside a recipe app. Draft lists from writers include 40+ verbs: chop, slice, dice, mince, grate, peel, wash, rinse, soak, boil, simmer, steam, fry, deep-fry, bake, roast, grill, toast, stir, mix, whisk, pour, spread, sprinkle, measure, weigh, reheat, preheat, etc. New users feel lost and say, “I don’t know which verbs matter most; everything looks the same.” You can highlight only **12–15 verbs** in the main cheat sheet; the rest must live behind an “advanced” link.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should anchor the cheat sheet (how users actually use the app).  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that are easy for beginners to understand.  
3. Explain **how each cluster drives concrete product decisions** about which verbs to surface and how.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core preparation verbs that appear in nearly every recipe (chop, slice, peel, wash, mix, stir).  
  - Core heat verbs that define cooking methods (boil, fry, bake, roast, grill).  
  - One or two kitchen-control verbs (preheat, reheat) that often confuse beginners.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Prep & cleaning*: wash, peel, chop, slice, mix, stir – what you do before and while cooking.  
  - *Heat & method*: boil, fry, bake, roast, grill – how you apply heat.  
  - Optional *Oven control*: preheat, reheat – small but high-impact verbs that change timing.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which verbs appear as large icons with examples (“Chop: cut into small pieces”) and which move into an expandable list (dice, mince, deep-fry, grill vs toast nuance). You design the UI around “Prep” and “Heat” sections instead of one flat alphabetic list.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize verbs by frequency in beginner recipes and confusion reports; track help-sheet opens and error reports (“burned food,” “forgot to preheat”).  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Presenting too many near-synonyms; failing to distinguish prep vs heat.

## Q3: Condensing shared-kitchen signage for hygiene and safety

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Office manager responsible for a shared office kitchen  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Office manager, Employees, Cleaners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
Your office kitchen is messy: dirty dishes in the sink, food left on the counter, spills on the floor, and bad smells from old food in the fridge. A draft sign from HR is long and full of polite phrases: “We kindly ask all colleagues to remember that it is everyone’s responsibility to maintain a pleasant environment…” followed by 15 bullet points. People ignore it. You can redesign the signage using only **3 short rules** and a few strong kitchen words (wash, wipe, throw away, fridge, sink, counter, trash, hot, sharp, slippery).

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** (key actions and objects) that should appear on the new signs.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to check whether the new signs work.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Washing dishes and cups after use (wash, sink).  
  - Wiping surfaces and cleaning spills (wipe, counter, slippery).  
  - Throwing away old food and trash (throw away, trash, fridge).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Dishes*: “Wash your dish and cup, then put them on the rack” – focuses on sink and wash.  
  - *Surfaces & floor*: “Wipe the counter and any spills – wet floor = slippery” – focuses on wipe and slippery.  
  - *Food & trash*: “Throw away old food and put trash in the bin” – focuses on fridge, trash, bin.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters become three short rule lines with bold kitchen words, not long paragraphs. You drop soft wording and extra details. Each sign maps directly to visible behaviors.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track number of dirty-dish incidents, visible spills, and fridge clean-out volume before vs after; prioritize dishes and surfaces first, then fridge habits.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Keeping vague polite text; listing too many small rules instead of three visible, action-focused ones.

## Q4: Framing a basic kitchen-safety briefing for new staff

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Supervisor onboarding new café staff  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: Supervisor, Kitchen staff, Customers | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You manage a small café kitchen. New staff include part-time students with limited English. Incidents include minor cuts, slips near the sink, and customers complaining about undercooked food and dirty tables. A long written manual exists but nobody reads it. You must give a **10-minute oral safety briefing** using simple kitchen vocabulary: knife, cutting board, raw, cooked, hot, burn, spill, slippery, clean, dirty, wash, fridge, temperature.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should structure the briefing (what you absolutely must cover).  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **1–3 simple metrics** and a priority order to check whether the briefing works.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Knife and cutting-board safety (sharp knife, stable board).  
  - Hot surfaces and liquids (hot pan, oven, coffee; burn risk).  
  - Raw vs cooked food and cleanliness (raw meat, cooked food, clean/dirty surfaces, wash hands).  
  - Spills and slippery floor (spill near sink, mop/wipe quickly).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Sharp & hot*: focus on knife and hot items; words: knife, sharp, hot, burn.  
  - *Food & hygiene*: raw vs cooked, clean vs dirty, wash, fridge and temperature basics.  
  - *Floor & spills*: spill, slippery, wipe/mop immediately.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide the order and vocabulary of your talk and posters: you keep repeating a few key words (“sharp, hot, raw, clean, spill”) instead of listing every possible danger. This helps low-level English speakers remember.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track number of minor injuries, undercooked-food complaints, and slip incidents; prioritize sharp & hot and food & hygiene first, then spills.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Using complex language; spreading attention across too many low-risk details.

## Q5: Defining the Kitchen module for a vocabulary-learning app

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Product manager for a language-learning app  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: PM, Curriculum designer, Engineers, Learners | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are scoping the Kitchen module of an English vocabulary app. Content designers propose 250+ items: every appliance and utensil, recipe verbs, advanced cooking techniques, food adjectives, cleaning products, brand names, and idioms like “too many cooks in the kitchen.” Engineering can support ~60–80 core items in version 1. Marketing wants “fun kitchen vocabulary,” while curriculum designers argue for practical, high-frequency words for everyday cooking and cleaning.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should define the Kitchen module’s scope for version 1.  
2. Group them into **2–3 MECE clusters** that map to clear learning paths.  
3. State clearly what you will **exclude or push to later** and why (scope boundaries).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Everyday zones and items learners see daily (kitchen, counter, sink, stove, fridge, cupboard, plate, cup, bowl).  
  - Core tools and verbs that power simple recipes and cleaning (knife, cutting board, pot, pan, spoon, boil, fry, bake, wash, wipe).  
  - A minimal safety & hygiene set (raw, cooked, hot, clean, dirty, spoiled, spill).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Places & things*: rooms and objects (kitchen, counter, sink, stove, oven, fridge, cupboard, plate, cup, bowl).  
  - *Actions*: high-frequency cooking and cleaning verbs (boil, fry, bake, cut/chop, mix, wash, rinse, wipe, throw away).  
  - *States & safety*: contrast pairs and risk words (raw/cooked, hot/cold, clean/dirty, fresh/spoiled, spill).  
- **Scope Boundaries**: In-scope: high-frequency items and verbs that support simple real tasks (“Make pasta,” “Clean the kitchen”). Out-of-scope for v1: rare appliances, brand names, idioms, and advanced chef techniques (sauté, flambé), which can move to later “Advanced Kitchen” or “Idioms” packs.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters decide which ~60–80 cards ship first and how they group into lessons; they keep the module focused and teachable.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize coverage of the three clusters; success metrics include learner ability to describe their kitchen and follow a simple recipe using at least five Kitchen words.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Letting rare or “fun” words crowd out core everyday vocabulary; failing to set hard out-of-scope lines.
