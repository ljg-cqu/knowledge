1. **Noun**: thanks (U/C, typically used in plural form)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An expression of gratitude; words or actions that show you are grateful for something someone has done
   - *(Sense 2)* In the phrase "thanks to," it functions as part of a prepositional phrase meaning "because of" or "as a result of"
   
   **Synonyms**: gratitude, appreciation, acknowledgment, recognition, credit
   
   **Antonyms**: ingratitude, ungratefulness, blame, criticism
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thanks" when expressing gratitude informally or when it's part of fixed expressions like "thanks to," "give thanks," "many thanks." Common in everyday conversation, informal emails, and casual professional contexts. In the phrase "thanks to," it shifts from gratitude to causation marking.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal contexts, prefer "gratitude," "appreciation," or formal expressions like "I would like to express my appreciation." Don't use alone without context—needs phrase completion like "thanks for" or "thanks to." Not appropriate in formal academic writing for expressing gratitude (use formal alternatives).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - give thanks (for something)
   - thanks to (because of)
   - many thanks
   - thanks for (+ noun/gerund)
   - vote of thanks
   
   **Root Analysis**: thank (verb base) + -s (plural marker, though often used as collective singular)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "þanc" (thought, favor, gratitude) → Middle English "thank" → Modern English "thanks." Originally meant "thought" or "good will," evolved to specifically mean "gratitude" by Middle English period. The plural form "thanks" became the standard expression of gratitude.

   - The quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness
   - A warm feeling of thankfulness and appreciation
   
   **Synonyms**: thankfulness, appreciation, recognition, acknowledgment, indebtedness
   
   **Antonyms**: ingratitude, ungratefulness, thanklessness
   
   **When to Use**: Use "gratitude" in formal contexts when expressing deep or sincere appreciation. Appropriate in formal speeches, written acknowledgments, professional correspondence, and when describing the emotion rather than just expressing it. More elevated than "thanks" and suitable for serious or significant acknowledgments.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation—"thanks" is more natural informally. Not appropriate as a standalone exclamation (can't say "Gratitude!" as you can say "Thanks!"). Avoid in contexts where simpler expressions would be more natural and sincere.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - express gratitude (for something)
   - deep gratitude
   - debt of gratitude
   - with gratitude
   - show gratitude
   
   **Root Analysis**: grat(e) (pleasing, thankful) + -itude (state/quality suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "gratus" (pleasing, thankful) → Old French "gratitude" → Middle English "gratitude" (15th century). Entered English as a formal learned word from French, maintaining its elevated register.

   - I feel so much gratitude for everything you've done for our family.

Common in academic writing (acknowledgments section), professional correspondence, and formal recognition contexts. Implies both recognition and some degree of gratitude or credit.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation—"thanks" is more natural. Not appropriate when simple, warm gratitude is the goal (sounds bureaucratic). Avoid in contexts requiring emotional warmth rather than formal recognition.
   
   **Common Phrases**:

   **Root Analysis**: ac- (to, toward) + knowledge (recognize) + -ment (noun suffix indicating action/result)

   **When to Use**: Use "credit" when explicitly acknowledging someone's role in an achievement or when attributing success or good work to specific individuals. Common in professional contexts, team settings, and when discussing responsibility for outcomes. Often appears in phrases like "give credit," "take credit," "credit goes to."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound transactional or competitive—not ideal for warm personal gratitude. Avoid when sincere emotional appreciation is the goal; "credit" focuses on attribution rather than gratitude. Not appropriate in contexts where it might imply keeping score or competition.

   - give credit (to someone)
   - take credit (for something)
   - credit goes to
   - to someone's credit
