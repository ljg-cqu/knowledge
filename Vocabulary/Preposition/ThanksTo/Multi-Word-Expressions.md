1. **Expression**: thanks to (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A prepositional phrase used to indicate that something happened because of a particular person, action, or circumstance; expresses causal attribution
   - *For positive contexts*: Acknowledges beneficial contribution or enabling factor
   - *For negative contexts (ironic)*: Attributes blame or cause for undesirable outcome
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the words "thanks" and "to" must appear together in this order for this meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, as a result of, on account of, by virtue of, by means of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, notwithstanding, regardless of
   
   **When to Use**: Use when attributing outcomes to specific causes, particularly when acknowledging contributions or explaining causation. Appropriate across most registers, though slightly more common in spoken/informal contexts than very formal academic writing. Effective for giving credit, explaining success factors, or (ironically) identifying causes of problems. Works well in narratives, explanations, acknowledgments, and causal analyses.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts requiring direct personal gratitude face-to-face (say "thank you" instead). Not suitable when the causal relationship is complex, uncertain, or contested—use more nuanced expressions. In the most formal academic writing, "due to" or "owing to" may be preferred. Don't use when it might be misinterpreted as sarcasm if genuine appreciation is intended.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "all thanks to" (emphatic version emphasizing the cause's importance)
   - "it's thanks to X that..." (cleft structure for emphasis)
   - "we have X to thank for..." (explicit acknowledgment structure)
   - "thank you to X for..." (more direct gratitude, less causal)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For this fixed phrase*: Originally literal—directing thanks toward someone/something. Over centuries (16th-17th), the phrase grammaticalized from expressing gratitude to indicating causation. The partnership became fixed because "thanks" (plural noun) + "to" (directional preposition) formed a stable prepositional unit. The phrase maintains semantic echoes of gratitude while primarily functioning as causal marker, making it particularly suitable for positive attributions (though ironic use for negatives is now common).
   
   **Root Analysis**: "thanks" from Old English "þanc" (thought, gratitude, favor) + "to" from Old English "tō" (directional preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I got the job, thanks to all your great advice and practice interviews!
   - We're completely soaked now—thanks to forgetting the umbrella.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The research findings achieved international recognition thanks to rigorous methodology and transparent data sharing practices.
   - Implementation delays occurred thanks to inadequate stakeholder consultation during the project design phase.

2. **Expression**: all thanks to (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An emphatic collocation that intensifies causal attribution, emphasizing that something is entirely or primarily due to a specific cause
   - Conveys that the cause mentioned is the main or sole factor responsible for the outcome
   - *Fixedness*: medium-strong ("all" strongly collocates with "thanks to" for emphasis)
   
   **Synonyms**: entirely because of, solely due to, completely owing to, it's all because of, exclusively as a result of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite everything, in spite of all, regardless of, not because of
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to emphasize that a particular factor was the primary or sole cause of an outcome. Particularly effective in strong acknowledgments, emphatic explanations, or when contrasting against other potential causes. Works well when the causal role is clear, significant, and deserving of emphasis.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when multiple factors contributed significantly (overstates single cause). Can sound excessive or sarcastic if the contribution was minor or if tone isn't carefully managed. Not appropriate in very formal academic contexts where precise causal language is required. May offend if it inadvertently diminishes others' contributions.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "and it's all thanks to..." (sentence continuation adding emphasis)
   - "All of this is thanks to..." (fronting the entire outcome for emphasis)
   - Position variation: sentence-initial or sentence-final
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For this collocation*: "All" naturally intensifies "thanks to" by emphasizing totality/completeness of attribution. This collocation emerged as speakers sought to strengthen causal claims beyond simple "thanks to." The partnership is frequent but not absolutely fixed—other intensifiers can substitute ("entirely thanks to," "solely thanks to"), making fixedness medium-strong rather than strong.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "all" (Old English "eall" - entire, whole) + "thanks to" (see previous entry)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We made it on time, all thanks to your crazy driving skills!
   - The whole evening was ruined, all thanks to the restaurant losing our reservation.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The initiative exceeded its targets all thanks to sustained community engagement and strategic partnership development.
   - The system architecture required complete redesign, all thanks to inadequate scalability planning in the initial specification phase.

3. **Expression**: no thanks to (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A fixed phrase indicating that something happened despite someone's or something's negative influence, lack of help, or hindrance
   - Expresses that the outcome succeeded without assistance from, or even despite interference from, the mentioned factor
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed expression with specific contrastive meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: despite, in spite of, without help from, despite the hindrance of, notwithstanding the lack of support from
   
   **Antonyms**: thanks to, because of, with help from, owing to the support of
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasizing that success was achieved despite lack of support, active hindrance, or negative circumstances. Appropriate when you want to highlight resilience, self-reliance, or overcoming obstacles. Can express criticism of those who didn't help or who created obstacles. Common in narratives of overcoming adversity or when making a pointed contrast.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you want to maintain positive relationships—directly criticizes or diminishes the named party. Not appropriate in formal acknowledgments or when diplomatic language is required. Can sound bitter or resentful; use carefully in professional contexts. Avoid when constructive feedback would be more appropriate than criticism.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "and no thanks to..." (adding contrastive emphasis)
   - "We succeeded, no thanks to..." (fronting the achievement)
   - Often followed by explicit contrast: "No thanks to X, but thanks to Y, we succeeded"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For this fixed phrase*: The negation "no" + "thanks to" creates a fixed antonym of "thanks to," specifically meaning "despite" with added critical connotation. This partnership is strongly fixed because the negative element reverses the causal attribution, transforming acknowledgment into criticism. The phrase is idiomatic—its meaning (achievement despite hindrance) is more than the sum of its parts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "no" (negation) + "thanks to" (see previous entry) = contrastive fixed phrase
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I finished the project on time, no thanks to my laptop crashing every five minutes.
   - We survived the camping trip, no thanks to someone forgetting the food supplies!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The program achieved its objectives, no thanks to the delayed funding disbursement and inadequate administrative support.
   - The research maintained its integrity, no thanks to external pressures to compromise methodological rigor for expedited results.

4. **Expression**: it's thanks to [X] that [Y] (type: collocation - cleft structure)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A cleft sentence structure that emphasizes the causal factor by fronting it, making the cause the focus of the sentence
   - Highlights the relationship between cause and effect with particular emphasis on the cause's role
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common pattern but structurally flexible)
   
   **Synonyms**: [Y] because of [X], the reason [Y] is [X], [X] is why [Y], [Y] is attributable to [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: it's despite [X] that [Y], [Y] happened regardless of [X], [X] had nothing to do with [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to strongly emphasize the causal factor and its critical importance to the outcome. The "it's...that" structure naturally creates focus on the cause. Particularly effective in explanations, acknowledgments, and when clarifying causation. Works well in both positive and ironic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing where simpler constructions may be preferred. Can sound too emphatic if overused. Not suitable when causation is uncertain or when multiple complex factors contributed. May sound awkward in very casual conversation where simpler structures flow better.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Without "it's": "Thanks to [X], [Y]" (simpler, less emphatic)
   - Reversed: "[Y], and it's all thanks to [X]" (effect-first structure)
   - Question form: "Is it thanks to [X] that [Y]?" (inquiry about causation)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For this collocation*: The cleft structure ("it's...that") is a general English pattern for emphasis. Combined with "thanks to," it creates strong focus on the causal factor. This collocation is productive and frequent but not entirely fixed—other causal expressions can appear in the same structure ("it's because of X that Y"). The partnership strength comes from frequency of use and effectiveness in highlighting causation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "it's" (contracted copula) + "thanks to" + "that" (complementizer) = emphatic cleft construction
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's thanks to your reminder that I didn't forget my mom's birthday this year!
   - It's thanks to the terrible traffic that we missed the first half of the movie.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - It is thanks to sustained interdisciplinary collaboration that the research consortium achieved breakthrough discoveries in this complex domain.
   - It is thanks to inadequate stress testing protocols that critical system vulnerabilities remained undetected until production deployment.

5. **Expression**: (we) have [X] to thank for [Y] (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A fixed expression that explicitly names the person, action, or circumstance responsible for an outcome, framed as the object of thanks
   - Implies obligation or gratitude while clearly identifying the cause
   - Can be used genuinely for positive outcomes or ironically for negative outcomes
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiomatic structure)
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] is responsible for [Y], we owe [Y] to [X], [X] deserves credit for [Y], [Y] is attributable to [X], [X] caused [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] had no role in [Y], [Y] happened despite [X], [X] is not responsible for [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explicitly acknowledging someone's or something's role in bringing about an outcome, particularly in formal recognition or clear attribution contexts. The structure naturally frames attribution as acknowledgment. Effective in speeches, formal acknowledgments, retrospective analysis, and when credit assignment is important. Works for both positive (genuine) and negative (ironic) outcomes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when attribution might be controversial or when you want to minimize the causal claim. Can sound sarcastic for negative outcomes unless context makes irony clear. Not ideal for immediate face-to-face thanks (use "thank you" directly). May seem overly formal in very casual contexts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Singular: "I have [X] to thank for [Y]"
   - Emphatic: "(we) have no one but [X] to thank for [Y]"
   - Negative: "(we) have only [X] to thank for [Y]" (often ironic)
   - Question: "Do we have [X] to thank for this?"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For this fixed phrase*: The structure "have...to thank for" is a fixed English idiom where "have" indicates possession/obligation, "to thank" frames it as gratitude-debt, and "for" introduces the outcome. This three-part structure is strongly fixed because it functions as an idiom—the meaning (causal attribution) goes beyond literal "having someone available for thanking." The phrase grammaticalized from literal gratitude expression to causal attribution marker while retaining gratitude framing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "have" (possess/obligation) + "[X]" (object) + "to thank" (infinitive) + "for" (benefactive/causal) + "[Y]" (outcome) = fixed attribution structure
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We have Jake to thank for finding this awesome restaurant—best food ever!
   - I have my alarm not going off to thank for being late to the interview.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The institution has its founding members to thank for establishing the rigorous standards that continue to define organizational excellence.
   - The department has inadequate succession planning to thank for the current leadership vacuum and resulting operational challenges.
