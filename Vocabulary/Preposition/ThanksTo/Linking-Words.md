1. **Linking Word**: thanks to (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A prepositional phrase functioning as a causal connector that introduces the reason or cause for a situation, particularly emphasizing positive attribution or (ironically) negative causation
   - *Function*: Establishes cause-effect relationship between clauses or sentences; typically introduces the cause while the main clause states the effect
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, as a result of, on account of, by virtue of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding, even though
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thanks to" when explaining causation, particularly when acknowledging contributing factors to outcomes (positive or ironically negative). Works well at sentence-initial position to emphasize the cause, or mid-sentence for smoother flow. Common in explanatory writing, attribution statements, and causal analysis.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing in formal academic writing where "due to" or "owing to" may be more appropriate. Don't use when expressing genuine gratitude (use "thank you" instead). Not suitable when multiple complex causes need explanation—consider "as a result of" or more elaborate constructions. Avoid in contexts where the causal relationship is unclear or contested.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Thanks to X], [main clause effect]. OR [Main clause effect] [thanks to X].
   - **Position**: sentence-initial (most common, emphasizes cause) / sentence-final (emphasizes effect)
   - **Punctuation**: When sentence-initial, follow with comma: "Thanks to X, Y happened." When sentence-final, may use comma or no comma depending on flow: "Y happened thanks to X." or "Y happened, thanks to X."
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Don't use with finite verb ("Thanks to he helped" ✗); must follow with noun phrase ("Thanks to his help" ✓). Avoid comma splice: "The project succeeded, thanks to this we celebrated" ✗ (use period or semicolon).
   
   **Root Analysis**: thanks (noun, plural form) + to (preposition) = compound prepositional phrase functioning as causal connector
   
   **Etymology**: English → From "thanks" (gratitude acknowledgment) + "to" (directional attribution). Originally literal gratitude direction, evolved 16th-17th century into causal connector indicating attribution of outcomes.
