1. **Adjective**: grateful (gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Feeling or showing thanks; having or showing appreciation for something done or received

More formal and less common than "indebted" or "obliged." Typically used in the construction "beholden to someone (for something)."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal or literary—rarely used in modern casual speech. Can sound archaic or overly dramatic. Avoid in contexts where simple gratitude without heavy obligation is intended. Not used attributively (can't say "a beholden person"—must say "a person beholden to").

   - beholden to (someone)
   - beholden for (something)
   - feel beholden
