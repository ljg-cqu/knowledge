1. **Functional Expression**: Thanks to [person/thing], [outcome] (function: attributing causation/acknowledging contribution)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A functional expression used to attribute a result or outcome to a particular person, action, or circumstance; performs the pragmatic function of acknowledging contributions or explaining causation
   - *Formality*: neutral (acceptable across most registers with slight adjustments)
   - *Directness*: direct attribution with positive connotation (or ironic for negative)
   
   **Synonyms**: Because of [X], [outcome]; Due to [X], [outcome]; As a result of [X], [outcome]; Owing to [X], [outcome]; [Outcome] is attributable to [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: Despite [X], [outcome]; In spite of [X], [outcome]; Regardless of [X], [outcome]; Notwithstanding [X], [outcome]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you need to explicitly credit someone or something for a positive outcome, or when explaining causation in narrative or expository contexts. Appropriate when acknowledging help, contributions, enabling factors, or (ironically) negative causes. Works well in professional acknowledgments, explanatory contexts, and causal analyses. Particularly effective when the attribution is clear and uncontested.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when expressing direct personal gratitude in face-to-face contexts (use "thank you" instead). Not appropriate when causation is uncertain, contested, or involves multiple complex factors requiring nuanced explanation. In very formal academic writing, "due to" or "owing to" may be preferred. Don't use when it might sound sarcastic if genuine appreciation is intended.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - More formal: "Owing to [X], [outcome]"; "Due to [X], [outcome]"; "As a result of [X], [outcome]"
   - Less formal: "Because of [X], [outcome]"; "[Outcome]—all thanks to [X]"
   - Emphatic: "It's all thanks to [X] that [outcome]"; "We owe [outcome] entirely to [X]"
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression combines gratitude language with causal attribution, making it particularly effective for positive face work (acknowledging others' contributions). When used ironically for negative outcomes, it can serve as indirect criticism or humorous complaint. The structure allows speaker to foreground either the cause (sentence-initial) or the effect (sentence-final), providing flexibility in information emphasis.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting acknowledgment: "I'm glad I could help"; "It was a team effort"; "Happy to contribute"
   - Deflecting credit: "Oh, you did most of the work"; "Anyone would have done the same"; "It wasn't just me"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Thanks to you, I didn't completely bomb that presentation!
   - We're totally lost—thanks to your brilliant navigation skills.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Thanks to the committee's thorough review, the policy recommendations reflect diverse stakeholder perspectives.
   - The system failure occurred thanks to inadequate stress testing during the development phase.

2. **Functional Expression**: It's (all) thanks to [X] that [outcome] (function: emphatic attribution)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An emphatic version of causal attribution that foregrounds the cause and emphasizes its critical importance to the outcome; performs pragmatic function of strong acknowledgment or explanation
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: direct and emphatic, strong causal claim
   
   **Synonyms**: [Outcome] is entirely because of [X]; We owe [outcome] to [X]; [X] is the reason that [outcome]; [Outcome] wouldn't have happened without [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: [Outcome] happened despite [X]; [X] had nothing to do with [outcome]; [Outcome] occurred regardless of [X]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to strongly emphasize someone's or something's critical role in bringing about an outcome. Particularly effective in acknowledgments, celebrations, or when giving credit. The emphatic structure makes the attribution more forceful and memorable. Works well when the causal relationship is clear and significant.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you need subtle or nuanced attribution—this structure is inherently emphatic. Not appropriate in very formal academic writing. Can sound exaggerated if the contribution was minor. May seem sarcastic when used for negative outcomes unless clearly framed as humor.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Without "all": "It's thanks to [X] that [outcome]" (slightly less emphatic)
   - Alternative emphasis: "[Outcome], and it's all thanks to [X]"
   - Question form: "Is it thanks to [X] that [outcome]?"
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The "it's...that" cleft structure provides double emphasis by both fronting the cause and using a focusing construction. This makes it particularly powerful for acknowledgments and gratitude. However, the emphasis can read as excessive or sarcastic if tone isn't carefully managed.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Humble acceptance: "I was just doing my part"; "We all contributed"; "I appreciate that"
   - Enthusiastic agreement: "Absolutely!"; "That's exactly right"; "I'm so glad it helped"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's all thanks to your last-minute save that we didn't lose the client!
   - We're stuck here for hours—it's all thanks to someone forgetting the keys.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - It is thanks to decades of sustained research that we now understand this phenomenon comprehensively.
   - The initiative's premature termination occurred—it's thanks to insufficient stakeholder consultation during the planning phase.

3. **Functional Expression**: We have [X] to thank for [outcome] (function: acknowledging credit/causation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A functional expression that attributes an outcome to a specific person or cause by explicitly naming them as the object of thanks; performs pragmatic function of giving credit or explaining causation with personal acknowledgment
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: direct attribution with explicit acknowledgment structure
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] is responsible for [outcome]; We owe [outcome] to [X]; [X] deserves credit for [outcome]; [Outcome] is attributable to [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] had no role in [outcome]; [Outcome] happened despite [X]; We can't credit [X] for [outcome]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explicitly acknowledging someone's or something's role in bringing about an outcome, particularly in contexts requiring clear credit attribution. Works well in acknowledgment speeches, formal recognition, explanatory narratives, and retrospective analysis. The "have...to thank" structure naturally implies obligation or gratitude while clearly identifying the cause.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the attribution might be controversial or when multiple parties contributed (unless acknowledging all). Can sound sarcastic when used for negative outcomes unless carefully framed. Not ideal for immediate face-to-face gratitude (use "thank you" directly instead).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Singular: "I have [X] to thank for [outcome]"
   - Emphatic: "We have no one but [X] to thank for [outcome]"
   - Question form: "Do we have [X] to thank for this?"
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This structure explicitly frames the attribution as a debt of gratitude ("have...to thank"), making it particularly suitable for formal acknowledgments and recognition. It can also be used ironically for negative outcomes, where the "gratitude" framing adds sarcastic emphasis.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Gracious acceptance: "I'm honored"; "It was my pleasure"; "Thank you for recognizing that"
   - Modest deflection: "It was a team effort"; "Others played important roles too"; "I was glad to help"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We have Sarah to thank for pulling together that amazing party on such short notice!
   - I have my phone's dead battery to thank for missing the entire meeting.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The foundation has its dedicated volunteer network to thank for achieving unprecedented community reach this year.
   - The project delays can be traced to inadequate planning—we have the rushed timeline to thank for insufficient risk assessment.
