1. **Verb**: thank
   **Meaning**: 
   - (transitive) To express gratitude to someone; to tell someone that you are grateful for something they have done or given
   - (transitive) To hold someone responsible or give credit for something (usually in phrases like "have someone to thank for")

   **Antonyms**: blame, criticize, condemn, reproach
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thank" when directly expressing gratitude to someone for their help, gift, or action. Appropriate across all registers, from casual conversation to formal correspondence. The most common and versatile verb for expressing gratitude in English. Can be immediate or retrospective.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing in extremely formal academic writing where more elaborate expressions may be appropriate. Don't use in passive voice for direct gratitude (say "I thank you," not "you are thanked"). Be cautious with ironic usage as it can sound passive-aggressive.

   - thank someone (for something)
   - have someone to thank for
   - I'd like to thank...
   - thank goodness/God/heavens
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English base "þanc" (thought, gratitude) → verbal form "þancian"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "þancian" (to give thanks) → Middle English "thanken" → Modern English "thank." Derived from the noun "þanc" (thought, gratitude). The verb maintained close connection to expressions of gratitude throughout its history.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Thanks for grabbing coffee with me today—I really needed to talk!

   **Synonyms**: recognize, admit, accept, concede, appreciate, thank, credit
   
   **Antonyms**: deny, ignore, dismiss, reject, disregard
   
   **When to Use**: Use "acknowledge" in professional and formal contexts when recognizing contributions, admitting facts, or giving formal credit. More formal than "thank"—appropriate in business correspondence, academic writing, official recognition. Implies both recognition and appreciation but with more formal distance than "thank."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual, warm gratitude among friends and family—use "thank" instead. Can sound stiff or bureaucratic in personal contexts. Avoid when emotional warmth is more appropriate than formal recognition. Not ideal for immediate, spontaneous gratitude.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - acknowledge someone's contribution
   - acknowledge receipt (of something)
   - acknowledge the help of
   - publicly acknowledge
   - acknowledge with gratitude
   
   **Root Analysis**: ac- (to, toward) + knowledge (recognize, know) → acknowledge
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "knowlechen" → "acknowledggen" (15th century). Combines intensive prefix "ac-" with "knowledge," creating "acknowledge" meaning "to recognize formally or admit openly."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He finally acknowledged that I was right about needing to leave earlier.
   - She didn't even acknowledge me when I walked into the room.

More formal than "thank" but warmer than "acknowledge." Can refer to both emotional gratitude and intellectual recognition.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound slightly formal in very casual contexts among close friends—"thanks" is more natural. Be cautious in contexts requiring humble gratitude; "appreciate" can sound slightly transactional. Avoid in situations requiring immediate, spontaneous warmth.

   - appreciate someone's help/effort
   - I would appreciate it if...
   - greatly appreciate

   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound transactional or formal—not ideal for warm personal gratitude. Avoid when emotional appreciation is more appropriate than attribution. Not suitable for contexts requiring humble or heartfelt thanks. Can imply competition for recognition.

   - credit someone with (something)
   - be credited with (doing something)

   **When to Use**: Use "attribute" in formal and academic contexts when explaining causation or assigning responsibility for outcomes. Common in analytical writing, formal reports, academic papers, and when discussing factors contributing to results. More analytical and objective than "credit" or "thank."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal and analytical for contexts requiring emotional gratitude or personal acknowledgment. Not appropriate for direct expressions of thanks. Avoid in casual conversation where simpler alternatives are more natural. Can sound clinical or detached.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - attribute something to someone/something
   - be attributed to
   - attribute success/failure to
