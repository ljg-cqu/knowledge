1. **Preposition**: thanks to (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Causal)* Used to indicate the cause or reason for something, especially when expressing that something positive happened because of someone or something

   **Synonyms**: because of (in context of causation), due to (formal context), owing to (formal context), as a result of, on account of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, notwithstanding, regardless of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thanks to" when expressing causation, particularly when acknowledging positive outcomes or achievements. Also used ironically for negative outcomes. Common in both spoken and written English across registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing where "due to" or "owing to" may be preferred. Don't confuse with the gratitude expression "thanks" (without "to" + noun). Not appropriate when direct gratitude is intended - use "thank you" instead.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: thanks to [person/thing], thanks to [possessive pronoun] efforts, thanks to [noun phrase]
   - **Verb + prep**: succeed thanks to, improve thanks to, achieve thanks to, fail thanks to (ironic)
   - **Adjective + prep**: possible thanks to, available thanks to, successful thanks to
   - **Noun + prep**: success thanks to, improvement thanks to, progress thanks to
   
   **Root Analysis**: thanks (noun, plural of "thank") + to (preposition indicating direction/attribution)
   
   **Etymology**: English → "thanks" from Old English "þanc" (thought, gratitude) + "to" (directional preposition). The phrase evolved from expressing gratitude directed toward someone/something to indicating causation (16th-17th century).
