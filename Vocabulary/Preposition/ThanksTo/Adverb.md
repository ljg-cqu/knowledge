1. **Adverb**: thankfully (type: sentence adverb/manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Sentence adverb)* Fortunately; used to express relief or pleasure that something good happened or something bad did not happen
   - *(Manner adverb)* In a grateful or appreciative manner; with gratitude
   
   **Synonyms**: fortunately, luckily, happily, gratefully, mercifully
   
   **Antonyms**: unfortunately, unluckily, regrettably, sadly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thankfully" as a sentence adverb (most common) to express relief that a situation turned out well, or as a manner adverb to describe how someone expresses gratitude. Common in both spoken and written English. As sentence adverb, typically appears at sentence beginning or before main verb. Most frequent meaning is "fortunately" rather than "in a thankful manner."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When sentence adverb usage might be ambiguous—can sometimes be unclear whether you mean "fortunately" or "in a grateful manner." In very formal academic writing, "fortunately" may be clearer. Avoid overusing as filler word. When manner meaning is intended, context must make this clear to avoid confusion.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - thankfully + clause (sentence adverb)
   - accept thankfully
   - receive thankfully
   - thankfully, no one was hurt
   - respond thankfully
   
   **Root Analysis**: thankful (grateful, relieved) + -ly (adverb suffix indicating manner or degree)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "þancfullīce" → Middle English "thankfully" → Modern English "thankfully." Originally meant "gratefully," but sentence adverb usage meaning "fortunately" became dominant in 20th century, sometimes controversially among prescriptivists.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: thankfully, appreciatively, with gratitude, with appreciation, with thanks
   
   **Antonyms**: ungratefully, unappreciatively, thanklessly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "gratefully" to describe how someone receives, accepts, or acknowledges something—emphasizing their gratitude. Common in formal and literary contexts.

   **When NOT to Use**: Cannot be used as sentence adverb meaning "fortunately" (unlike "thankfully"). Less common in very casual speech—may sound slightly formal. Avoid when describing actions that don't involve receiving or accepting something with gratitude.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - accept gratefully
   - receive gratefully
   - acknowledge gratefully
   - gratefully accept
   - respond gratefully
   
   **Root Analysis**: grateful (feeling gratitude) + -ly (adverb suffix indicating manner)

   **Synonyms**: gratefully, thankfully, admiringly, with appreciation, with gratitude
   
   **Antonyms**: unappreciatively, critically, dismissively, with disdain
   
   **When to Use**: Use "appreciatively" to describe actions that show both gratitude and recognition of value. Common in formal and literary contexts. Often modifies verbs of perception (look, listen, nod) or reception (receive, accept). Implies not just thankfulness but understanding and valuation. More formal than "gratefully" or "thankfully."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Quite formal—may sound stiff in casual conversation. Cannot function as sentence adverb. Avoid when simple gratitude without emphasis on value recognition is intended. Less common than "gratefully" in everyday usage.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - nod appreciatively
   - listen appreciatively
   - look appreciatively
   - smile appreciatively
   - receive appreciatively
   
   **Root Analysis**: appreciative (showing appreciation) + -ly (adverb suffix indicating manner)
   
   **Etymology**: "Appreciative" (19th century from "appreciate") + "-ly" → "appreciatively" (19th century). Relatively recent formation maintaining connection to both gratitude and recognition of value.

   - In a fortunate manner; with good luck
   
   **Synonyms**: luckily, happily, thankfully, mercifully, by good fortune
   
   **Antonyms**: unfortunately, unluckily, regrettably, sadly, unhappily
   
   **When to Use**: Use "fortunately" as a sentence adverb to express relief or satisfaction about a positive outcome. Very common in both formal and informal contexts. Typically appears at sentence beginning, before main verb, or sentence-finally. Clearer than "thankfully" when sentence adverb meaning is intended (no ambiguity about manner vs. sentence adverb).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when outcomes resulted from deliberate action rather than luck (use "successfully" or "effectively" instead). Don't use when the outcome is controversial—"fortunately" expresses the speaker's positive judgment. May minimize others' efforts if outcome actually resulted from hard work rather than luck.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - fortunately + clause
   - fortunately for (someone/something)
   - more fortunately

   **Root Analysis**: fortunate (lucky, favored by fortune) + -ly (adverb suffix)

   - In a lucky manner; with good luck
   
   **Synonyms**: fortunately, happily, thankfully, by chance, by good fortune
   
   **Antonyms**: unluckily, unfortunately, sadly, regrettably
   
   **When to Use**: Use "luckily" as a sentence adverb to emphasize that a positive outcome occurred by chance rather than planning. Slightly more informal than "fortunately." Common in narrative contexts and casual conversation. Emphasizes the role of luck or chance more than "fortunately" does. Typically sentence-initial or mid-sentence position.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Less appropriate in very formal academic writing where "fortunately" may be preferred. Avoid when outcome resulted from skill or planning rather than chance—may inadvertently diminish effort. Can sound too casual in serious formal contexts.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - luckily + clause

   **Synonyms**: profoundly, greatly, intensely, extremely, sincerely, thoroughly
   
   **Antonyms**: shallowly, superficially, slightly, barely, minimally
   
   **When to Use**: Use "deeply" as an intensifier with adjectives expressing gratitude (grateful, thankful, appreciative, indebted) to emphasize sincerity and intensity of feeling. Common in formal acknowledgments, serious expressions of thanks, and emotional contexts. Adds weight and sincerity to gratitude expressions. Works across registers but particularly effective in formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly dramatic if overused. May seem insincere if the situation doesn't warrant intense gratitude. Avoid in very casual contexts where it might sound stiff. Don't use when moderate gratitude is more appropriate to the situation.
