1. **Functional Expression**: in line with [goal/policy/values], ... (function: justifying/positioning)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describes a decision, action, or recommendation as matching an agreed goal, policy, or value set
   - *Formality*: neutral/formal
   - *Directness*: indirect justification (appeals to shared reference rather than personal opinion)
   
   **Synonyms**: consistent with [goal], aligned with [strategy], in keeping with [values], in accordance with [policy]
   
   **Antonyms**: at odds with [policy], contrary to [values], inconsistent with [strategy]
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to show that your suggestion is not arbitrary, but follows from an established direction—particularly in business, policy, or governance contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you are proposing a clear departure or innovation that deliberately breaks from past practice; in that case, emphasise the change rather than claiming alignment.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - This is in line with our long‑term strategy.
   - The update is in line with our sustainability commitments.
   - These changes are in line with industry best practices.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Invokes a shared standard to reduce disagreement; can be persuasive if the audience accepts the reference point, but may sound hollow if they do not recognise the stated goal or value as legitimate.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Accepting]: "Yes, that seems in line with what we agreed earlier."
   - [Questioning]: "In line with which specific policy? Can you point to the relevant section?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This move is in line with what we said we wanted for the team.
   - The new schedule is in line with everyone’s need for more focus time.

1. **Functional Expression**: bring [X] in line with [Y] (function: requesting adjustment/correction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Signals that something currently diverges from a reference standard and needs to be adjusted to match it
   - *Formality*: neutral/formal
   - *Directness*: moderately direct about the need to change, indirect about who is at fault
   
   **Synonyms**: adjust [X] to match [Y], align [X] with [Y], bring [X] into compliance with [Y], update [X] to reflect [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: deliberately move away from [Y], depart from [Y], break with [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: When policies, documentation, behaviour, or metrics are no longer matching agreed standards, and change is needed to restore alignment
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When there is active disagreement about whether [Y] is still valid; first align on the reference point itself.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - We need to bring our practices in line with the new guidelines.
   - Let’s bring the documentation in line with the approved template.
   - Salaries should be brought in line with market benchmarks.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Useful in change‑management and compliance conversations—focuses on the gap between current and desired state rather than blaming individuals; can still feel top‑down if overused without explanation.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Accepting]: "Agreed. What steps do we need to take to bring it in line?"
   - [Resisting]: "If we bring it in line with that guideline, we’ll lose flexibility in key cases."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We should bring our habits more in line with the budget we agreed on.

   - *Directness*: indirect, focuses on process rather than criticism
   
   **Synonyms**: keep [X] aligned with [Y], maintain alignment with [Y], stay in step with [Y], remain consistent with [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: drift away from [Y], fall out of line with [Y], lose alignment with [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: When discussing monitoring, governance, or continuous improvement to prevent misalignment—budgets, KPIs, policies, or communication
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When a one‑off correction is needed ("bring in line" is more appropriate) or when deliberate divergence is planned.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - We need to keep our messaging in line with the brand.
   - Keep decisions in line with the agreed priorities.
   - The roadmap should stay in line with customer needs.

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Accepting]: "Let’s set up a regular review to keep it in line with the guidelines."
   - [Clarifying]: "Which priorities should we keep in line with when trade‑offs appear?"

   - *Directness*: indirect but pointed; can imply pressure or lack of choice
   
   **Synonyms**: comply with, go along with, conform to, follow, accept
   
   **Antonyms**: push back against, resist, refuse to comply, break ranks
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to highlight that someone adapts their position or behaviour to match a new direction, often after initial hesitation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in sensitive contexts where you want to emphasise collaboration and buy‑in; "fall in line" can suggest coercion.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Eventually the team fell in line with the new policy.
   - We expect all departments to fall in line with this decision.
   - Other players quickly fell in line with the market leader.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Carries a subtle power dynamic—often used when decision‑makers expect others to adjust; may sound authoritarian if used directly to instruct people.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Critical]: "We don’t just want people to fall in line; we want them to understand and support the change."

   - *Directness*: direct criticism of misalignment, but can be softened by specifying the standard
   
   **Synonyms**: inconsistent with, at odds with, in conflict with, contrary to, misaligned with
   
   **Antonyms**: in line with, consistent with, aligned with, in keeping with
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to label something as inappropriate, non‑compliant, or out of sync with expectations—especially in feedback, ethics, or performance discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you are not sure the standard applies or when a more exploratory, non‑judgemental tone is needed (e.g., early brainstorming).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - This behaviour is out of line with our values.
   - These results are out of line with what we projected.
   - The proposal is out of line with regulatory requirements.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Strong phrase for setting boundaries; effective when standards are clear and shared, but can provoke defensiveness if used without explanation.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Corrective]: "You’re right, this is out of line with our guidelines; we’ll revise it."
