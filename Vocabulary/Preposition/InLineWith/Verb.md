   **When to Use**: Use "align with" when you describe how policies, behaviours, or results relate to expectations, principles, or external standards; very common in reports and strategic discussions

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - harmonize regulations
   - harmonize standards
   - harmonize interests
   - harmonize data formats
   - harmonize design elements
   
   **Root Analysis**: harmony (agreement) + -ize (verb suffix meaning "to make")

   - design that conforms to standards
   - refuse to conform

   - comply with regulations
   - comply with a request
   - fully comply
   - fail to comply
   - required to comply
   
   **Root Analysis**: com- (together) + ply (fold, bend)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - realign priorities

   - realign the portfolio
   - realign incentives
   - realign with market realities

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - calibrate a model
