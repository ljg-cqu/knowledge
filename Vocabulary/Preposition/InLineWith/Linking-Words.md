1. **Linking Word**: in line with (type: connector/phrasal preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - [Collins-style definition]
   - *Function*: Introduces alignment or conformity with policies, expectations, trends, or previous statements; often used to justify a decision by relating it to a standard
   
   **Synonyms**: consistent with, in accordance with, aligned with, in keeping with, in harmony with
   
   **Antonyms**: at odds with, out of line with, contrary to, inconsistent with
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to explicitly connect a decision, result, or change to an existing goal, rule, or trend, especially in business, policy, or academic contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech where "match" or "fit with" may sound more natural; in strictly legal contexts, "in accordance with" or "pursuant to" may be preferred
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Decision/Result] is in line with [policy/expectation/previous findings].
   - [Position]: Usually mid‑clause as a prepositional phrase
   - [Punctuation]: Typically no comma when used after a verb; commas only when phrase is non‑essential
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing with "in lieu of" (which means "instead of"); overusing as vague corporate filler without naming a clear reference
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + line (alignment, direction) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Etymology**: Developed from literal physical alignment (standing in line) to metaphorical alignment with rules, trends, or expectations in 20th‑century business and policy language
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: When drawing an explicit connection between results and hypotheses, actions and values, or behaviour and prior statements, especially in academic or analytical writing

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Result] is consistent with [theory/previous research/our expectations].
   - [Position]: Typically follows a linking verb ("is/are")
   - [Punctuation]: No comma when used as complement of the verb

   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + sist (stand) + -ent (adjective) + with (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: From "consistent" (Latin *consistere*) + "with"; widely used in scientific and legal registers by the 19th–20th centuries

   - [Position]: Typically used after the verb or at the end of the clause
   - [Punctuation]: No comma unless used as a non‑essential comment
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing with "keeping up with" (which implies speed rather than harmony)
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + keep (maintain) + -ing (gerund) + with (preposition)

   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using for loose similarity when there is no real coordination
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + sync (short for "synchronization") + with
