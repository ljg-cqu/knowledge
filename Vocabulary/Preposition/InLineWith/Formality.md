   **Context**: A manager presenting a plan during an internal meeting, emphasising that it follows existing rules and guidelines.
   
   **Core Intent**: To state that a plan or proposal conforms to established policy and is therefore legitimate and acceptable.
   
   **Casual**: This plan fits with how we normally do things.  
   *Characteristics*: Simple vocabulary ("plan", "fits"), conversational tone, contractions allowed, no corporate jargon.  
   *Use when*: Talking with close colleagues, in informal team chats, or when reassuring peers that an idea won’t cause trouble.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: This proposal is in line with how we usually operate.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral professional tone, "in line with" retained, avoids heavy legal language, clear subject–verb structure.  
   *Use when*: Everyday meetings, internal emails, slide decks, or discussions with cross‑functional partners.
   
   **Formal**: This proposal is fully in line with the company’s established policies and procedures.  
   *Characteristics*: Explicit reference to "established policies and procedures", hedging removed, complete sentence, no contractions.  
   *Use when*: Formal presentations, board documents, official reports, or policy reviews.
   
   **Humorous**: This proposal walks the policy line without stepping on any legal landmines.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor ("walks the line"), playful image ("legal landmines"), light tone while still signalling compliance.  
   *Use when*: Relaxed internal settings, teams that appreciate humor, after trust is established.
   
   **Lively**: This proposal keeps us firmly in line with policy while still moving the business forward.  
   *Characteristics*: Dynamic verbs ("keeps", "moving"), positive framing, energetic rhythm.  
   *Use when*: Rallying a team, pitching in workshops, or summarising in presentations.
   
   **Empathetic**: This proposal stays in line with company policy, so you won’t have to worry about compliance issues.  
   *Characteristics*: Directly addresses emotional concern ("won’t have to worry"), supportive tone, focuses on removing anxiety.  
   *Use when*: Reassuring cautious stakeholders, new managers, or teams that have recently faced compliance problems.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use the formal version when speaking upward (to executives, regulators); casual or semi‑formal is suitable among peers.
   - *Social Distance*: The more distant or unfamiliar the listener, the more neutral or formal the variant should be.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high‑risk or audit‑sensitive topics, prefer semi‑formal or formal variants that clearly reference policy.
   - *Cultural Context*: In high‑power‑distance cultures, stronger emphasis on "established policies and procedures" is often expected.
   - *Medium*: Written reports and emails favour the formal/semi‑formal versions; live discussions can flex toward casual or lively.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using a very casual variant ("it’s fine") in audit or regulatory contexts, which can sound careless.
   - Claiming alignment with policy without having checked the actual documents.
   - Over‑stating alignment ("perfectly in line") when there are known exceptions or open questions.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some corporate cultures, explicit references to policy signal professionalism; in more agile or startup‑like environments, over‑emphasis on policy can sound bureaucratic. Adapting the strength of the phrase "in line with company policy" is important.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal steering meeting → **Appropriate Variant**: "This proposal is in line with how we usually operate." (balances clarity and flexibility)
   - **Situation 2**: Board presentation → **Appropriate Variant**: "This proposal is fully in line with the company’s established policies and procedures." (signals rigour)
   - **Situation 3**: 1‑on‑1 with a risk‑averse colleague → **Appropriate Variant**: "This proposal stays in line with company policy, so you won’t have to worry about compliance issues." (addresses emotional safety)

1. **Original Expression**: We need to bring our practices in line with the new guidelines.  
   **Context**: A team lead explaining that current day‑to‑day work no longer matches updated standards.
   
   **Core Intent**: To call for adjustment so that current practice matches new external requirements.
   
   **Casual**: We’ve got to tweak how we work so it matches the new guidelines.  
   *Characteristics*: Informal verb ("tweak"), relaxed tone, everyday vocabulary.  
   *Use when*: Talking to a familiar team in a stand‑up or informal chat.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: We need to adjust our current practices to bring them in line with the new guidelines.  
   *Characteristics*: Clear action verb ("adjust"), explicit link to "new guidelines", standard business tone.  
   *Use when*: Writing internal emails, slide notes, or status reports.
   
   **Formal**: Our operational practices must be brought fully in line with the newly issued guidelines.  
   *Characteristics*: Passive construction, "must" for obligation, "newly issued guidelines" for precision.  
   *Use when*: Policy updates, audit responses, formal memos.
   
   **Humorous**: The guidelines moved, so now our habits need to catch up and fall back in line.  
   *Characteristics*: Personification of "guidelines" and "habits", playful image, still clear that change is required.  
   *Use when*: Easing anxiety about change in a relaxed team setting.
   
   **Lively**: Let’s bring what we do every day back in line with the new guidelines and clean up the grey areas.  
   *Characteristics*: Inclusive "let’s", action‑oriented verbs ("bring back", "clean up"), energetic pacing.  
   *Use when*: Launching a short compliance improvement push or workshop.
   
   **Empathetic**: I know the new guidelines add pressure, but we’ll update our practices step by step so they’re fully in line and you feel protected.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges emotional impact, promises gradual support, focuses on feeling "protected".
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal wording when speaking for the organization; casual/lively variants for peer‑level coordination.
   - *Social Distance*: The more distant the audience, the clearer and less playful the language should be.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: High regulatory or safety risk favours the formal variant with "must be brought fully in line".
   - *Cultural Context*: In some cultures, strong obligation language ("must") is expected; in others, collaborative framing ("let’s") works better.
   - *Medium*: Written directives prefer formal/semi‑formal; workshops and town halls can safely use lively/empathetic versions.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Minimising the change by saying "just a small tweak" when changes are substantial.
   - Not naming the reference point ("new guidelines") so people don’t know what to line up with.
   - Sounding threatening ("you must comply or else") rather than supportive in internal change communication.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In highly regulated industries, aligning with guidelines is non‑negotiable; tone can still range from punitive to collaborative. Choosing language that supports learning while stressing obligation is key.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Quick stand‑up → **Appropriate Variant**: "We’ve got to tweak how we work so it matches the new guidelines."
   - **Situation 2**: Compliance memo → **Appropriate Variant**: "Our operational practices must be brought fully in line with the newly issued guidelines."
   - **Situation 3**: Team under stress → **Appropriate Variant**: "We’ll update our practices step by step so they’re fully in line and you feel protected."

1. **Original Expression**: Our prices are in line with the rest of the market.  
   **Context**: A salesperson or product manager explaining that pricing matches what competitors charge.
   
   **Core Intent**: To state that prices are neither unusually high nor unusually low compared with a reference group.
   
   **Casual**: Our prices are pretty much the same as what everyone else is charging.  
   *Characteristics*: Informal intensifier ("pretty much"), everyday phrase ("everyone else"), relaxed tone.  
   *Use when*: Casual sales conversations, internal discussions, friendly customers.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Our pricing is broadly in line with the rest of the market.  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "broadly in line" to allow small differences, neutral professional tone.  
   *Use when*: Sales decks, internal briefings, stakeholder updates.
   
   **Formal**: Our pricing structure is in line with prevailing market rates for comparable products and services.  
   *Characteristics*: Precise noun phrases ("pricing structure", "prevailing market rates"), formal register, no contractions.  
   *Use when*: Investor reports, regulatory communication, formal documentation.
   
   **Humorous**: Our prices march in step with the market—they don’t run ahead or lag behind.  
   *Characteristics*: Military metaphor ("march in step"), balanced image, light tone.  
   *Use when*: Presentations where mild humour is acceptable.
   
   **Lively**: Our prices stay in line with the market so you get fair value without nasty surprises.  
   *Characteristics*: Positive emotional framing ("fair value", "no nasty surprises"), energetic but clear.  
   *Use when*: Marketing copy, launch presentations, customer‑facing communication.
   
   **Empathetic**: We keep our prices in line with the market so you can feel confident you’re paying a fair rate.  
   *Characteristics*: Focuses on customer feelings ("feel confident"), reassurance about fairness, supportive tone.  
   *Use when*: Talking to cost‑sensitive customers, in FAQ or customer emails.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Investor or regulator audiences prefer the formal variant; peer‑level or customer‑facing interactions can use semi‑formal or lively options.
   - *Social Distance*: The less you know the listener, the safer it is to use semi‑formal language.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For sensitive negotiations, avoid humour and stick to semi‑formal or formal phrasing.
   - *Cultural Context*: Perceptions of "fair pricing" vary; some cultures expect explicit reference to benchmarks, others rely more on trust.
   - *Medium*: Websites and brochures lean toward lively/empathetic language; contracts and SLAs require formal wording.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Claiming prices are "in line" without evidence, undermining trust when customers compare.
   - Using very casual phrasing ("we’re not ripping you off") in professional contexts.
   - Forgetting to mention what "the rest of the market" actually includes.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In markets where bargaining is common, stating that prices are in line with the market may be read as an opening position; in fixed‑price cultures it is often treated as a factual claim that should be demonstrably true.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: One‑to‑one sales conversation → **Appropriate Variant**: "Our prices are pretty much the same as what everyone else is charging."
   - **Situation 2**: Investor report → **Appropriate Variant**: "Our pricing structure is in line with prevailing market rates for comparable products and services."
   - **Situation 3**: Customer FAQ → **Appropriate Variant**: "We keep our prices in line with the market so you can feel confident you’re paying a fair rate."
