   **Common Phrases**: 
   - strategic alignment

   - pressure for conformity
   - conformity assessment

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you only mean physical thickness of a substance (still a valid sense, but then clarify with context); do not use when you specifically mean logical correctness ("validity" may fit better)
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - consistency with
   - internal consistency
   - consistency of performance
   - lack of consistency
   - consistency across teams
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + sist (stand) + -ency (state or quality)

   - live in harmony with
   - social harmony
   - harmony between form and function
   - bring X into harmony with Y

   - strategic fit
   - fit between X and Y
   - find the right fit
