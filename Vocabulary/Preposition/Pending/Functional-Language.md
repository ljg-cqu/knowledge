   - Can I double-check the status of [X]? (more tentative)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Just to clarify" serves as a discourse marker signaling that speaker is seeking precision, not challenging; reduces face-threat of appearing not to have paid attention

   - Any progress on [X]? (much more direct, casual)
   - I wanted to inquire about the status of [X] (more formal)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Past continuous "was wondering" creates psychological distance and tentativeness, reducing face-threat; positions inquiry as gentle curiosity rather than demand

   - We need to expedite this matter (more direct, authoritative)
   - Could we possibly fast-track this? (more tentative, polite)

   - This matter requires prompt attention given the duration (more formal)
   - We really need to move on this - it's been waiting too long (more casual)

   **When to Use**: Planning around pending matters, managing expectations, when precision isn't possible but estimate is helpful
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When precise timeline is critical and available, very formal legal/compliance contexts requiring certainty, when "ballpark" sounds too casual
