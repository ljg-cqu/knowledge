# Linking Words & Discourse Markers: Pending

1. **Linking Word**: pending (type: subordinating conjunction/preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Until something happens; during the time before an event or decision occurs; while awaiting
   - *Function*: Expresses temporal relationship indicating an action or state that continues until a future condition is met
   
   **Synonyms**: until, while awaiting, in anticipation of, until such time as, before
   
   **Antonyms**: following, after, subsequent to, once (indicating time after rather than before)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing and legal documents describing interim states, professional communication about temporary arrangements, expressing conditionality based on future events
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "until" or "while waiting"), when simpler conjunctions suffice, contexts requiring precise temporal markers
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [action/state] + pending + [noun/gerund/clause]
     - "The project is on hold pending approval."
     - "Pending further investigation, no action will be taken."
   - [Position]: Can appear at beginning (formal) or middle of sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma after introductory "pending" clause; no comma when in middle position
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use "pending" with simple future (incorrect: "pending tomorrow"); use with events/conditions not time points
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin pendere (to hang) → suggesting "hanging" or "suspended" state until resolution
   
   **Etymology**: Latin pendere (to hang, be suspended) → Old French → English "pending" (15th century), originally meaning "while hanging in the balance"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everything's on hold pending the boss's decision.
   - We can't move forward pending approval from legal.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The contract remains in effect pending completion of the due diligence process.
   - Pending resolution of the outstanding compliance issues, operations will continue under current protocols.

1. **Linking Word**: meanwhile (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the intervening time; at the same time as something else is happening; in the period between two events
   - *Function*: Connects two concurrent or sequential events, often contrasting ongoing situation with pending resolution
   
   **Synonyms**: in the meantime, in the interim, at the same time, simultaneously, while
   
   **Antonyms**: subsequently, afterwards, then, eventually (indicating later time rather than concurrent time)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing actions during waiting periods, narrative sequences, status updates involving concurrent activities, bridging between current state and expected resolution
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When events are strictly sequential rather than concurrent, formal legal writing preferring "in the interim," when overused in short passages
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about pending matter]. Meanwhile, [concurrent action/state].
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial with comma, or mid-sentence between commas
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "meanwhile"; commas around mid-sentence use
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use multiple "meanwhile"s in short text (repetitive); ensure temporal logic is clear
   
   **Root Analysis**: mean (middle) + while (time period) = "in the middle time"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "mean while" (in the middle time) → merged into "meanwhile" (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The approval is still pending. Meanwhile, we're working on other projects.
   - Meanwhile, while waiting for the decision, I've been preparing the next steps.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The matter remains under review. Meanwhile, interim measures have been implemented.
   - Pending final approval, operations will continue as planned. Meanwhile, preparatory work has commenced.

1. **Linking Word**: until (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Up to the point in time when; up to the time that something happens; continuing up to a specified moment
   - *Function*: Expresses temporal limit indicating action continues up to a future point or condition
   
   **Synonyms**: till, up to, pending, before, up until
   
   **Antonyms**: since, from, after, following (indicating starting point rather than endpoint)
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing duration of pending states, indicating temporal boundaries, describing conditions that continue until resolution
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "pending" or "awaiting" better captures suspended state, very formal legal documents preferring "pending"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [action continues] + until + [future event/condition]
     - "The status remains pending until the review is complete."
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence connecting clauses, or sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: No comma before "until" in mid-sentence; comma after introductory "until" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse with "unless" (condition) vs "until" (time); avoid double negatives with "until"
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English und (up to) + til (to) = "up to the time of"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "und" + "til" → Middle English "until" (12th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The project is on hold until we get approval.
   - I can't give you an answer until the decision comes through.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The application will remain pending until all required documentation has been submitted and verified.

1. **Linking Word**: in the meantime (type: discourse marker/transitional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the intervening period; in the time between now and a future event; while waiting for something to happen
   - *Function*: Discourse-level connector indicating concurrent actions during pending period
   
   **Synonyms**: meanwhile, in the interim, for now, temporarily, while waiting
   
   **Antonyms**: afterward, subsequently, eventually, in the end (indicating later time rather than intervening time)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing interim actions while awaiting resolution, transitioning between topics in longer texts, professional updates about temporary measures
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly casual contexts (use "meanwhile"), when "pending" alone suffices, in very short messages where phrase is wordy
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Pending situation]. In the meantime, [interim action].
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial with comma, or parenthetical with commas
   - [Punctuation]: Always followed by comma when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use repeatedly in short passages; ensure interim action is genuinely concurrent with pending matter
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + the + meantime (intervening period)
   
   **Etymology**: "Mean" (middle) + "time" → phrase emerged 16th century meaning "in the middle time"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The approval is still pending. In the meantime, let's prep the materials.
   - In the meantime, while we wait, we can work on other stuff.

   **Synonyms**: whilst (British formal), as, during the time that, at the same time as
   
   **Antonyms**: after, before, once, when (depending on context)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing concurrent actions during pending periods, contrasting two simultaneous states, narrative flow showing parallel activities
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When strict temporal sequence matters more than concurrence, when contrast is stronger than concurrence (use "whereas")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: While [pending situation continues], [other action occurs]
     - "While the matter is pending, we should prepare contingency plans."
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (with comma after clause) or mid-sentence (no comma typically)
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "while" clause; usually no comma in mid-sentence position
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse "while" (time) with "whereas" (contrast); avoid ambiguity between temporal and contrastive meanings
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English hwīl (period of time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwīl" (time period) → Middle English "while" (12th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - While we're waiting for approval, let's get everything else ready.

   **Antonyms**: nevertheless, however, despite this, in spite of (showing contrast rather than consequence)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing showing logical connections, explaining impacts of pending situations, academic and professional contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "so"), when causal relationship is weak or unclear, when overused in short texts
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Cause: pending situation]. Consequently, [effect/result].
     - "The approval is pending. Consequently, we cannot proceed with implementation."
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (most common), with comma
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "consequently"; semicolon before if connecting independent clauses in same sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use without clear causal relationship; avoid in casual contexts where it sounds pretentious
   
   **Root Analysis**: consequent (following as result) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin consequi (to follow) → consequence → consequently (16th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The approval's still pending, so consequently we're stuck waiting.
   - Payment is delayed. Consequently, we can't ship yet.

   **When to Use**: Introducing contrasting information about pending matters, formal writing showing unexpected situations, transitioning to limiting information
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual speech (use "but"), when "but" would be simpler and clearer, when overused (sounds repetitive)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about pending matter]. However, [contrasting information].
     - "The decision is pending. However, early indications are positive."
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (most formal), mid-sentence (between commas), or sentence-final (rare)
   - [Punctuation]: Comma (or semicolon + comma) before sentence-initial; commas around mid-sentence use
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't begin too many consecutive sentences with "however" (monotonous); distinguish from "but" (more casual)
   
   **Root Analysis**: how + ever (in whatever way)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "how ever" → merged "however" (14th century), originally meaning "in whatever manner"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Given that [pending situation], [consequence/action]
     - "Given that the approval is pending, we should delay the announcement."
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (with comma after clause) or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "given that" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse with "given" (simple preposition); ensure causal logic is sound
   
   **Root Analysis**: given (past participle of "give") + that (conjunction)
   
   **Etymology**: "Given" (granted, assumed) + "that" → emerged as phrase 20th century in formal usage

     - "As yet, no decision has been reached."
   - [Position]: End of clause (most common) or sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "as yet"; no punctuation in end position
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Typically used with negative constructions; avoid in casual contexts (sounds overly formal/archaic)
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (to the degree) + yet (up to now)
