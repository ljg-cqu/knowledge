1. **Linking Word**: per (type: preposition used as connector in rate expressions)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Connects a quantity to its unit of measurement, creating rate expressions
   - *Function*: Establishes mathematical or logical relationships between quantities and units (cost per item, rate per hour)
   
   **Synonyms**: for each, for every, a, an (in rate contexts: "$5 a/per hour")
   
   **Antonyms**: total, overall, aggregate, combined (when contrasting per-unit vs. total)
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing rates, ratios, measurements, or per-unit relationships; technical, business, or formal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When total amounts are more appropriate; avoid overuse in casual writing
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [amount] + per + [unit] → "$50 per person"
   - [Position]: follows the quantity being measured
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before or after "per"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing per-unit with totals; inconsistent unit usage
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin per (through, by means of, for each)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin per → English (16th century) for rate expressions
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It costs $5 per ticket, so $20 total for four.
   - We're going 60 miles per hour on the highway.

   **Synonyms**: according to, in accordance with, following, in line with, pursuant to
   
   **Antonyms**: contrary to, despite, regardless of, notwithstanding
   
   **When to Use**: Business writing when referencing agreements, policies, or previous discussions; formal compliance contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Academic writing (prefer "according to"); casual conversation (sounds bureaucratic); when overused becomes repetitive
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [action/statement] + as per + [source] → "Payment is due as per the contract"
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence, introducing the reference
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "as per" if it begins a subordinate clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overusing in general writing; using without specific reference source
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the manner of) + per (according to)
   
   **Etymology**: English as + Latin per → as per (19th century), business English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'll send the files as per our chat yesterday.

   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "per person"); when discussing totals rather than per-person figures
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [measurement] + per capita → "income per capita"
   - [Position]: follows the noun being measured; can function as post-modifier
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "per capita"; treated as compound unit
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing with "per household" or other units; using in non-statistical contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: per (for each) + capita (heads, plural of caput)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin per capita → English economic term (17th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [rate/amount] + per annum → "4.5% per annum"
   - [Position]: follows the rate or amount being specified
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "per annum"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using in casual contexts; inconsistent abbreviation (p.a. vs. per annum)
   
   **Root Analysis**: per (for each) + annum (year, from annus)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin per annum → English financial term (16th century)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] is not [quality] per se, but [contextual qualifier]
   - [Position]: typically follows the concept being qualified
   - [Punctuation]: commas often surround "per se" when it's a parenthetical
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overusing; using when "itself" suffices; confusing with "as per"
   
   **Root Analysis**: per (through, by) + se (itself)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin per se → English philosophical term (16th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's not illegal per se, just frowned upon.
   - I don't dislike it per se, just how it's used.

   - [Position]: mid-sentence, introducing contrasting clause
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "whereas"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using "whilst" in American English; confusing with "where"
   
   **Root Analysis**: where + as (in the place that)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English whereas → contrasting conjunction (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: When direct per-unit expression suffices without "at"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [verb] + at + [amount] per [unit] → "charged at $50 per hour"
   - [Position]: follows verb, introduces rate specification
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "at"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: omitting "at" when grammatically required; using "of" instead of "at" with rates
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English æt (in the position of)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English æt → at (before 12th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: When "by" more clearly indicates the rate of change
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [change verb] + with + [rate per unit] → "increased with $5 per unit"
   - [Position]: follows verb describing change or variation
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "with" in rate expressions
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing "with" (accompaniment) with "by" (rate of change)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English wið (against, toward, with)

   - [Position]: follows verb describing change
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "by"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing "by" (amount of change) with "to" (resulting value)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English bī (near, by)

   **Synonyms**: as a result, accordingly, hence, for this reason
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, conversely, despite this
   
   **When to Use**: Formal or academic writing when presenting conclusions from per-unit analysis
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "so"); overuse makes writing stilted
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [per-unit premise(s)], therefore [per-unit conclusion]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or mid-sentence, introducing consequence
   - [Punctuation]: semicolon before if joining independent clauses; comma after if sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using without clear causal relationship; overusing
   
   **Root Analysis**: therefore: there + for (for that reason); thus: Old English (in this way)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → therefore (13th century); Latin → thus (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's $20 per person and there are five of us, so that's $100 total.
   - We used 100 units per day, so we need 3,000 per month.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Consumption averaged 2.5 liters per capita per day; therefore, annual consumption totaled 912.5 liters per capita.
   - Costs were $50 per unit, with 1,000 units per month; thus, monthly expenditure was $50,000 per facility.
