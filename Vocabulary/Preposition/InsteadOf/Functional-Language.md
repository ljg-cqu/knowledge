1. **Functional Expression**: "Instead of [doing Y], why don't we [do X]?" (function: suggesting alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite way to propose an alternative course of action by contrasting it with the current or proposed option
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (softened suggestion)
   
   **Synonyms**: Rather than [Y], shall we [X]?, How about [X] instead of [Y]?, What if we [X] rather than [Y]?
   
   **Antonyms**: We must do Y, Let's stick with Y, Y is the only option
   
   **When to Use**: Brainstorming sessions, collaborative planning, offering alternatives in team settings, when you want to redirect without confrontation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Emergency situations requiring direct commands, when speaking to much higher authority (too casual), when alternatives are not actually possible
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Instead of [Y], why not [X]? (slightly more direct)
   - Rather than [Y], couldn't we [X]? (more tentative)
   - What about [X] instead of [Y]? (more casual)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses negative interrogative ("why don't") to soften the suggestion; "instead of" explicitly contrasts the alternative; inclusive "we" builds collaboration
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That's a good idea / That could work
   - I'm not sure about that, because...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Instead of meeting in person, why don't we just do a video call?
   - Instead of ordering pizza again, why don't we try that new Thai place?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Instead of implementing the changes immediately, why don't we conduct a pilot study first?
   - Rather than expanding regionally, why don't we focus on digital market penetration?

1. **Functional Expression**: "I'd rather [do X] than [do Y]" / "I'd rather [do X] instead of [Y]" (function: expressing preference)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Expresses personal preference for one action over another; indicates what speaker prefers to do instead
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct but softened by conditional "would"
   
   **Synonyms**: I prefer [X] to [Y], I'd choose [X] over [Y], I'd sooner [X] than [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: I'd rather do Y, I prefer Y, Y is better in my view
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing personal preferences, making choices, declining by offering alternative, casual to semi-formal settings
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you must defer to others' preferences, highly formal contexts (use "I would prefer"), when no choice is actually available
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I'd much rather [X] than [Y] (stronger preference)
   - I'd prefer [X] instead of [Y] (slightly more formal)
   - I'd sooner [X] than [Y] (emphatic, sometimes dramatic)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Conditional "would" softens the preference statement; "rather" suggests mild to strong preference depending on emphasis
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That works for me / Sounds good
   - Really? I actually prefer Y
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'd rather walk there instead of taking the bus.
   - I'd rather stay home tonight than go to another party.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - I would rather submit a revised proposal instead of proceeding with the current version.
   - I'd rather postpone the decision than make it without adequate data.

1. **Functional Expression**: "Rather than [doing Y], [let's/we should/I suggest] [do X]" (function: recommending alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Presents a recommendation by contrasting it with another option; formal way to suggest substitution
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (recommendation framed as contrast)
   
   **Synonyms**: Instead of [Y], [let's/we should] [X], In place of [Y], [I recommend] [X], As an alternative to [Y], [consider] [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: We should do Y, Let's proceed with Y, Y is recommended
   
   **When to Use**: Professional recommendations, formal suggestions, academic proposals, strategic discussions, when you want to redirect diplomatically
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual contexts (sounds formal), when you should be more direct, emergency situations
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Rather than [Y], I would suggest [X] (more tentative)
   - Rather than [Y], we could [X] (possibility frame)
   - Rather than [Y], it would be better to [X] (evaluative)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Rather than" is more formal than "instead of"; fronting the rejected option emphasizes what to avoid
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That's a valid point / I see your reasoning
   - I understand, but I still think Y is better because...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Rather than driving, let's take the train—it's faster.
   - Rather than texting, why don't we just call?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Rather than implementing comprehensive reforms, I suggest we adopt targeted improvements.

1. **Functional Expression**: "Instead of [complaint/problem], [positive alternative]" (function: reframing/redirecting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Redirects conversation from negative to positive by suggesting constructive alternative instead of dwelling on problems
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (diplomatic redirection)
   
   **Synonyms**: Rather than [complaining about Y], let's [do X], Let's [X] instead of [Y-ing]
   
   **Antonyms**: You're right to complain about Y, Y is indeed a problem
   
   **When to Use**: Coaching situations, managing complainers, facilitating productive discussions, redirecting unproductive conversations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When complaints are legitimate and need acknowledgment, with people in genuine distress, when the alternative isn't realistic
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Instead of focusing on [Y], let's focus on [X] (emphasis shift)
   - Rather than worrying about [Y], we could [X] (reducing anxiety)
   - Let's [X] instead of dwelling on [Y] (direct redirection)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Acknowledges the negative implicitly while redirecting energy toward constructive action; can be face-saving
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - You're right, let's do that
   - But the problem with Y is real, we can't just ignore it
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Instead of complaining about the weather, let's make the most of our indoor time.
   - Instead of worrying about what went wrong, let's figure out how to fix it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Rather than dwelling on the project's delays, let's focus on accelerating remaining milestones.

1. **Functional Expression**: "How about [X] instead?" / "What about [X] instead?" (function: suggesting alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Casual way to propose an alternative, often in response to a suggestion; offers substitution
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (question form softens suggestion)
   
   **Synonyms**: Why not [X] instead?, Could we do [X] instead?, What if we did [X] instead?
   
   **Antonyms**: No, let's stick with the original plan, That won't work
   
   **When to Use**: Brainstorming, casual planning, responding to suggestions, offering alternatives in friendly contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal contexts, when stronger directive is needed, with much higher authority
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - How about [X] as an alternative? (slightly more formal)
   - What about trying [X] instead? (emphasizes experimentation)
   - Or how about [X]? (briefer, more casual)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Question form reduces imposition; "instead" makes the substitution explicit; can be used to politely decline original suggestion
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Sure, that works / Sounds good
   - Hmm, I was really hoping for the original option
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You want to go to the mall? How about the park instead?
   - How about Wednesday instead of Tuesday?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The team suggested quarterly reviews. What about monthly check-ins instead?
   - How about implementing a phased approach instead of simultaneous deployment?

1. **Functional Expression**: "I was thinking [X] rather than [Y]" (function: tentatively suggesting alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Tentative way to propose an alternative; presents your thinking as ongoing process rather than firm decision
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: very indirect (hedged suggestion)
   
   **Synonyms**: I was considering [X] instead of [Y], I thought perhaps [X] rather than [Y], I had [X] in mind instead of [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: I've decided on Y, We'll do Y, Y is the plan
   
   **When to Use**: Collaborative planning, when you want to offer input without seeming pushy, exploring options, when hierarchy or relationship requires deference
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you need to be decisive, emergency situations, when clear direction is expected
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I was wondering about [X] instead of [Y] (even more tentative)
   - I thought maybe [X] rather than [Y] (adds uncertainty)
   - I'm thinking [X] might work better than [Y] (present progressive)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Past progressive "was thinking" creates distance and tentativeness; "rather than" is more formal than "instead of"; allows face-saving if suggestion is rejected
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, that's an interesting idea / Let's explore that
   - I see what you mean, but I still prefer Y
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was thinking we could meet for coffee rather than lunch.
   - I was thinking red instead of blue for the walls.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - I was thinking we might prioritize quality over speed rather than the reverse.
   - I was considering a qualitative methodology rather than quantitative for this study.

1. **Functional Expression**: "Maybe we could [do X] instead of [doing Y]?" (function: tentatively suggesting alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Very tentative suggestion using hedging and question form; offers alternative with minimal imposition
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: very indirect (heavily hedged)
   
   **Synonyms**: Perhaps we could [X] rather than [Y]?, Could we possibly [X] instead of [Y]?, What if we [X] instead of [Y]?
   
   **Antonyms**: We should definitely do Y, Y is the best option, Let's stick with Y
   
   **When to Use**: When suggesting to higher status person, when relationship is distant, when you're uncertain, when you want to minimize imposition
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you need to be assertive, with close friends (can sound unnecessarily hesitant), when situation requires confidence
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Maybe we should [X] instead? (slightly more assertive)
   - Perhaps [X] would work better than [Y]? (more formal)
   - We could try [X] instead of [Y]? (emphasizes experimentation)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Multiple hedges ("maybe," "could," question mark) minimize face threat; appropriate for power imbalances; can sound unconfident if overused
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Sure, that could work / Let's try it
   - I don't think that will work because...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Maybe we could go to the early showing instead of the late one?
   - Maybe we could split the cost instead of you paying everything?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Perhaps we could schedule the meeting for next week instead of this week?
   - Maybe we could implement a pilot program instead of a full rollout?

1. **Functional Expression**: "X might be better than Y" / "X might work better instead" (function: hedged recommendation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Suggests an alternative is superior while hedging with "might"; reduces assertiveness of the recommendation
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (hedged with modal)
   
   **Synonyms**: X could be preferable to Y, X may work better than Y, X would probably be better than Y
   
   **Antonyms**: X is definitely better than Y, Y is clearly superior, We should use Y
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to suggest without imposing, advisory contexts, when you're not certain, when recipient is sensitive to criticism
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you need to be definitive, when clear guidance is expected, in emergencies
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - X would be better than Y (more confident)
   - X seems better than Y (based on appearance/evidence)
   - X could work better instead (possibility frame)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Modal "might" hedges the recommendation; comparative "better" evaluates but modal softens it; face-saving for both parties
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - I think you're right / Good point
   - Maybe, but I still think Y has advantages
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Taking the highway might be better than the side roads.
   - Texting might work better than calling at this hour.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A decentralized approach might prove more effective than centralized management.
   - Digital distribution might be preferable to physical channels for this market segment.

1. **Functional Expression**: "Let's [do X] instead" / "Let's try [X] instead of [Y]" (function: proposing alternative action)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Directly proposes alternative action using inclusive "let's"; combines suggestion with implicit rejection of current/proposed option
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: moderately direct (directive softened by inclusive "let's")
   
   **Synonyms**: Why don't we [X] instead?, We should [X] rather than [Y], How about we [X] instead?
   
   **Antonyms**: Let's do Y, Let's stick with the plan, No, we'll do Y
   
   **When to Use**: Collaborative contexts, peer relationships, team settings, when you have roughly equal status, redirecting group action
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With much higher authority (too presumptuous), when you can't make the decision, very formal contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Let's go with [X] instead (slightly more decisive)
   - Let's consider [X] instead (more tentative)
   - Let's switch to [X] (implies already started Y)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Let's" creates inclusion and shared decision-making; "instead" explicitly marks substitution; balances assertiveness with collaboration
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Okay, let's do that / Sounds good
   - I'd rather stick with the original plan
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's walk instead of driving—it's nice out.
   - Let's try the new restaurant instead of the usual place.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Let's implement incremental changes instead of comprehensive restructuring.
   - Let's pursue a partnership model instead of full acquisition.

1. **Functional Expression**: "I suggest [doing X] rather than [doing Y]" (function: formal recommendation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Formal way to recommend an alternative; explicitly frames as personal suggestion while contrasting with alternative
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: moderately direct (softened by "suggest")
   
   **Synonyms**: I recommend [X] instead of [Y], I propose [X] rather than [Y], I advise [X] in place of [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: I suggest [Y], I recommend sticking with [Y], [Y] is advisable
   
   **When to Use**: Professional recommendations, advisory roles, formal proposals, when expertise justifies recommendation, consulting contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual contexts (too formal), when you shouldn't be giving advice, peer brainstorming (too authoritative)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I would suggest [X] instead of [Y] (more tentative)
   - I strongly suggest [X] rather than [Y] (more emphatic)
   - May I suggest [X] instead of [Y]? (more polite)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "I suggest" frames as opinion rather than command; "rather than" provides explicit contrast; maintains speaker agency while respecting listener autonomy
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Thank you for the suggestion / I'll consider that
   - I appreciate the input, but I think Y is better because...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I suggest taking the train instead of driving during rush hour.
   - I suggest we meet earlier rather than later in the day.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
