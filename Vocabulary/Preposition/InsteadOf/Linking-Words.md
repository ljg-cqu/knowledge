1. **Linking Word**: instead (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce an alternative action, choice, or situation that replaces another
   - *Function*: Marks substitution or contrast; signals that what follows replaces what was previously mentioned or expected
   
   **Synonyms**: alternatively, rather, as an alternative, in place
   
   **Antonyms**: additionally, also, furthermore, moreover
   
   **When to Use**: All registers; introducing alternatives; showing contrast between rejected and chosen options; emphasizing substitution
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When adding to rather than replacing (use "also"); when alternatives aren't truly substitutes; can cause fragments if misused
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about X]. Instead, [statement about Y]. (sentence-initial, contrast between sentences)
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial with comma, or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: Period before "instead" when beginning new sentence; comma after when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "Instead" alone as sentence creates fragment without clear antecedent
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + stead (place, position)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "in stede" (in place of) → Modern English "instead" (13th century, originally two words)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I didn't want coffee. Instead, I ordered tea.
   - We can't go out tonight; let's stay home instead.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Linking Word**: instead of (type: subordinating preposition/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce what is not chosen or done, followed by what replaces it; creates explicit contrast
   - *Function*: Subordinating connector that introduces the rejected option, with the main clause presenting the chosen alternative
   
   **Synonyms**: rather than, in place of, in lieu of, as an alternative to
   
   **Antonyms**: in addition to, along with, together with
   
   **When to Use**: All registers; connecting clauses or phrases; showing explicit substitution; comparing two options where one replaces another
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When both actions occur (use "as well as"); in formal legal texts (prefer "in lieu of"); creates wordiness if alternatives are obvious
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [X] instead of [Y] / Instead of [Y], [X]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence or sentence-initial
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "instead of Y" when sentence-initial; no comma when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Mixing forms ("instead of" vs "instead" used incorrectly); parallel structure violations
   
   **Root Analysis**: instead (in place) + of (preposition indicating relation)
   
   **Etymology**: "Instead" + "of" → prepositional phrase (15th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's walk instead of taking the car.
   - Instead of complaining, why don't we fix it?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: instead of, in preference to, as opposed to, in place of
   
   **Antonyms**: as well as, in addition to, along with
   
   **When to Use**: All registers (slightly more formal than "instead of"); expressing preferences; academic and professional writing; when emphasizing choice between alternatives
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual contexts (can sound formal); when no preference or choice exists; avoid in fragments
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [X] rather than [Y] / Rather than [Y], [X]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence or sentence-initial with comma
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "rather than Y" when sentence-initial; no comma when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Violating parallel structure ("running rather than to walk"); comma splices
   
   **Root Analysis**: rather (more willingly, preferably) + than (comparison marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hraþor" + "than" → "rather than" (comparative construction, 14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - *Function*: Discourse marker introducing alternatives; creates options rather than strict substitution; implies equal validity
   
   **Synonyms**: instead, on the other hand, or else, as another option
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, correspondingly
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and semi-formal contexts; presenting multiple options; academic writing; business communication; when alternatives coexist
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "instead" or "or"); when one option must replace another (not true alternatives)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Option 1]. Alternatively, [Option 2]. (sentence-initial between independent clauses)
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial with comma
   - [Punctuation]: Period before "alternatively"; comma after
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using in casual speech (sounds overly formal); overusing in single paragraph
   
   **Root Analysis**: alternative + -ly (adverbial suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "alternativus" + English "-ly" → "alternatively" (17th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We could drive there. Alternatively, we could take the train.
   - You can email me, or alternatively, just call.

   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, correspondingly, in the same way
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and academic contexts; presenting opposite perspectives; scientific writing; when relationships are inverse or reversed
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (too formal); when opposition isn't symmetrical; when simpler "instead" suffices
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement A]. Conversely, [Opposite statement]. (sentence-initial)
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial with comma, occasionally mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Period before; comma after
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using for non-opposite contrasts (use "however" or "instead"); overuse creates stilted prose
   
   **Root Analysis**: converse (turned around, opposite) + -ly (adverbial suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "conversus" (turned around) + "-ly" → "conversely" (18th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He likes mornings. Conversely, she's a night person.
   - Some prefer tea; conversely, others choose coffee instead.

   - [Position]: Usually mid-sentence, following the substituted item
   - [Punctuation]: No special punctuation required; follows normal sentence punctuation
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Misspelling as "in leu"; using in casual contexts; unnecessary when "instead of" is clearer
   
   **Root Analysis**: French "lieu" (place) → "in lieu of" (in place of)
   
   **Etymology**: French "lieu" (place) → English legal/formal usage "in lieu of" (16th century)
