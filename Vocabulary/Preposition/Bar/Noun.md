   **Meaning**: 
   - A long, straight piece of metal, wood, or similar material used to block, support, or fasten something
   - *(Sense 2)* Something that prevents progress or access; an obstacle or legal/structural limit

   **Synonyms**: rod, rail, barrier, obstruction, obstacle
   
   **Antonyms**: opening, passage, gateway, access, clearance
   
   **When to Use**: Use *bar* for physical rods (prison bars, metal bars across a door) and for abstract limits (*a bar to entry, a bar to progress*). In legal and formal contexts, *the bar* means the community of lawyers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse *bar* (rod/obstruction) with *bar* meaning *pub* in everyday English; avoid when you mean a general *"rule"* or *"law"* (use *regulation, statute, rule* instead).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - behind bars
   - a bar to entry
   - raise the bar / lower the bar
   - call to the bar
   - admit to the bar
   
   **Root Analysis**: bar (root meaning "rod, cross‑piece, obstruction")
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *barre* (rod, barrier) → Middle English *bar* (rod, barrier, cross‑piece); extended metaphorically to obstacles and the physical barrier between court and public, then to the legal profession.

   **Antonyms**: pathway, gateway, facilitator, aid, support
   
   **When to Use**: Use *barrier* for both literal and figurative blocks: a safety barrier on the road, language barriers, entry barriers in markets, barriers to learning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for temporary or very minor difficulties where *inconvenience* or *difficulty* is enough; use more specific words (e.g., *tariff, quota*) when legal/technical precision is required.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - barrier to entry
   - language barrier

   **When to Use**: Use *obstacle* for both practical and abstract difficulties in reaching a goal: obstacles in negotiations, technical obstacles, personal obstacles.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech where *problem* or *issue* is more natural; avoid for permanent, rule‑based limits where *ban* or *prohibition* is more precise.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - overcome an obstacle
   - remove obstacles
   - major/minor obstacle
   - legal/technical obstacle
   - present/pose an obstacle
   
   **Root Analysis**: ob- (against) + stac (standing, from Latin *stāre* "to stand") + -le (noun suffix)

   **When to Use**: Use *hindrance* in more formal or careful speech to describe something that *slows* or *holds back* progress rather than completely blocking it.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual talk where *problem* or *hassle* works; do not use when the issue fully bars progress—then *barrier*, *ban*, or *block* may be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - more of a hindrance than a help
   - a serious hindrance to
   - without let or hindrance (set phrase, very formal)
   - act as a hindrance
   
   **Root Analysis**: hinder (to make difficult) + -ance (noun suffix forming abstract nouns)

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Honestly, this old laptop is more of a hindrance than a help.

   **Antonyms**: free flow, throughput, wide open path
   
   **When to Use**: Use *bottleneck* for stages in a process or system where capacity is much lower than elsewhere, creating a functional *bar* to higher throughput (e.g. CPU bottleneck, hiring bottleneck, approval bottleneck).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for simple one‑off delays; *bottleneck* implies a structural, repeated constraint; do not use for complete legal bans (use *prohibition, ban*).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - eliminate a bottleneck
   - identify the bottleneck
   - production bottleneck
   - traffic bottleneck
   - bottleneck stage
   
   **Root Analysis**: bottle (container with narrow neck) + neck (narrow part) → figurative narrowing that restricts flow

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The slow Wi‑Fi is the main bottleneck in our setup.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - place/impose a ban on
   - lift a ban
   - enforce a ban
   - partial/total ban

   **Root Analysis**: ban (proclamation, command) → modern sense "official prohibition"
