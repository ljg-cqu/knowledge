   **Synonyms**: excluded, banned, prohibited, shut out, locked out

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - barred from entry

   **Synonyms**: restricted, select, high-end, limited, closed
   
   **Antonyms**: inclusive, open, accessible, public, shared
   
   **When to Use**: Use *exclusive* when a rule, club, product, or area is *barred* to most people, or when stating that a price or figure does *not include* something (*exclusive of tax*).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid if you want to emphasize openness or diversity; can carry elitist overtones. Do not confuse *exclusive* with *excluding* (participle) in legal texts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - exclusive club
   - exclusive access
   - exclusive rights
   - exclusive of tax
   - mutually exclusive
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + clus (close) + -ive (tending to) → tending to shut out

   **When to Use**: Use *closed* for both literal closed doors and figurative *closed systems* where access is barred (closed community, closed meeting, closed ecosystem).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you mean *finished/ended* (then *"over"* or *"complete"* may be clearer); for legal bans, *"prohibited, illegal"* can be more precise.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - closed door
   - closed community
   - closed system
   - closed group
   - closed to new members
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (shut) + -ed (past participle → adjective)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - restrictive policy
   - highly restrictive
   - restrictive covenant
   - restrictive immigration laws
   - overly restrictive
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (back) + strict (tight, from Latin *stringere* "to draw tight") + -ive (tending to)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - impermeable layer
   - impermeable barrier
   - socially impermeable
   - seemingly impermeable to change
