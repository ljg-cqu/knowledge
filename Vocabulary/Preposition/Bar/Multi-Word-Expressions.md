1. **Expression**: raise the bar (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To increase the required standard, level of difficulty, or expectations so that it becomes harder to meet them
   - *Fixedness*: strong (verb + noun collocation, often metaphorical)
   
   **Synonyms**: set higher standards, tighten requirements, increase the difficulty, push the limit
   
   **Antonyms**: lower the bar, relax standards, ease requirements, make it easier
   
   **When to Use**: Use *raise the bar* when someone or something increases expectations or performance standards so that previous efforts now fall below the new bar.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal legal or technical writing where concrete wording (*increase requirements, strengthen criteria*) is preferred; avoid when change is minor.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - really raise the bar
   - raise the bar for everyone
   - raise the bar on quality
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: The *bar* metaphor comes from high‑jump/pole‑vault events where a physical bar marks the required height. To *raise the bar* is to literally move the bar higher, making success harder and symbolizing stricter standards.
   
   **Root Analysis**: raise (lift to a higher level) + the bar (standard as horizontal bar)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That new feature really raised the bar for our whole product line.
   - Her presentation raised the bar for everyone else.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The revised guidelines significantly raise the bar for data transparency and reproducibility.
   - Recent regulatory changes have raised the bar on capital adequacy requirements.

1. **Expression**: lower the bar (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To reduce the required standard or expectations, making it easier to qualify or succeed
   - *Fixedness*: strong (direct contrast to *raise the bar*)
   
   **Synonyms**: relax standards, ease requirements, water down expectations, make allowances
   
   **Antonyms**: raise the bar, tighten standards, toughen requirements
   
   **When to Use**: Use *lower the bar* when criticizing weakened standards or describing a deliberate choice to make something more accessible by reducing barriers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In highly formal writing, choose neutral phrases (*reduce the requirements, adjust the threshold*); avoid when changes are about fairness rather than simply making things easier—then specify the goal.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - dangerously lower the bar
   - lower the bar too far
   - lower the bar for entry
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Mirrors *raise the bar* in the sports metaphor: moving the bar down makes a jump easier. Figuratively, it describes removing or weakening bars that once blocked weaker performers.
   
   **Root Analysis**: lower (move down) + the bar (standard/threshold)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They really lowered the bar for that exam this year.
   - I don't want to lower the bar just to get more sign‑ups.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Frequent deadline extensions risk lowering the bar for academic rigor.
   - Adjustments should improve inclusion without inadvertently lowering the bar on safety.

1. **Expression**: set the bar (high/low) (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To establish the standard or level of difficulty that others will be judged against
   - *Fixedness*: medium ("set the bar" is fixed; modifiers *high/low* are variable)
   
   **Synonyms**: establish the standard, define the benchmark, create the threshold
   
   **Antonyms**: remove the bar, leave standards undefined, blur the line
   
   **When to Use**: Use *set the bar* when talking about defining expectations or required performance levels, especially at the start of a project, course, or comparison.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when no comparison or standard is in question; do not mix with unrelated metaphors (e.g. *set the bar in stone*).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - set the bar high
   - set the bar low
   - clearly set the bar
   - set the bar for the industry
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Extends the jumping‑bar metaphor to the idea of choosing where the bar sits—how much the bar will bar people from success.
   
   **Root Analysis**: set (place, establish) + the bar (standard/threshold)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That first season really set the bar high for the show.
   - Let's set the bar low for the first sprint so we can learn.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Initial milestones set the bar for subsequent performance evaluations.
   - The pilot project will set the bar for quality expectations across regions.

1. **Expression**: behind bars (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In prison; locked up as a prisoner
   - *(Figurative)* Under strict control or confinement
   - *Fixedness*: strong (idiomatic phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: in jail, imprisoned, incarcerated, locked up
   
   **Antonyms**: free, at liberty, released, out on the street
   
   **When to Use**: Use *behind bars* in news, storytelling, or conversation to describe someone being in prison, often with a slightly vivid, informal tone.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in sensitive or formal legal documents where neutral terms (*incarcerated, in custody*) are preferred; avoid for metaphorical use that might trivialize real imprisonment.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - put someone behind bars
   - end up behind bars
   - remain behind bars
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: Literally refers to the metal bars that bar prisoners from leaving; figuratively, being "behind bars" is shorthand for being barred from freedom.
   
   **Root Analysis**: behind (at the back of) + bars (metal rods that block exit)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He'll be behind bars for a long time after that.
   - The scam finally put them behind bars.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The offender will remain behind bars pending appeal.
   - Decades behind bars reflect the seriousness of the offenses committed.

1. **Expression**: bar to entry (type: collocation/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A factor that prevents or strongly discourages people or organizations from entering a market, profession, or activity
   - *Fixedness*: medium (often appears as *barriers to entry* or *bar to entry*)
   
   **Synonyms**: barrier to entry, obstacle to entry, entry barrier, deterrent
   
   **Antonyms**: incentive to entry, open access, welcoming conditions
   
   **When to Use**: Use *bar to entry* or *barriers to entry* in economics, business, or policy discussions when describing costs, regulations, or conditions that act like bars, keeping new entrants out.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual conversation; *hard to get into* may be clearer. In technical writing, pick one form ("bar" vs "barrier") and use it consistently.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - significant bar to entry
   - high bars to entry
   - a major bar to entry for
   - regulatory bars to entry
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Extends the idea of a physical bar blocking passage to economic and social contexts where something bars newcomers from crossing a threshold.
   
   **Root Analysis**: bar (obstacle) + to (direction marker) + entry (act of entering)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The cost of equipment is a big bar to entry for small creators.
   - Long training time can be a real bar to entry for that career.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - High capital requirements serve as an effective bar to entry for potential competitors.
   - Complex licensing procedures constitute a substantial bar to entry in this sector.
