1. **Preposition**: throughout (type: compound)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* In or to every part of a place, space, or object; all the way through from one end to the other
   - *(Temporal)* During the entire period of time; from beginning to end without interruption
   - *(Abstract)* Present or happening in all parts of a system, organization, or process
   
   **Synonyms**: all through (in temporal contexts), all over (in spatial contexts), everywhere in (in spatial contexts), during the whole of (in temporal contexts), across (in spatial/abstract contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: nowhere in, in parts of, partially through, intermittently during
   
   **When to Use**: Use "throughout" to emphasize completeness, continuity, or comprehensive coverage across space, time, or abstract domains. Common in formal writing, reports, historical narratives, and descriptions requiring precision about extent or duration.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts requiring specificity about particular locations or moments (use "at," "in," "during" instead). Do not use when the coverage is partial or interrupted. Common learner errors: confusing with "through" (which emphasizes movement or passage), overusing in casual speech where simpler prepositions suffice.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: throughout the day, throughout history, throughout the world, throughout the process, throughout the organization, throughout the year, throughout one's life
   - **Verb + prep**: spread throughout, exist throughout, occur throughout, continue throughout, remain throughout
   - **Adjective + prep**: consistent throughout, present throughout, visible throughout, available throughout
   - **Noun + prep**: changes throughout, presence throughout, support throughout
   
   **Root Analysis**: through (Old English thurh "from end to end") + out (emphasis on completeness)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English thurh-ut → Middle English thurghout → Modern English throughout. Combines "through" (passage from one end to another) with "out" (completely, entirely) to emphasize comprehensive coverage.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I kept my phone on silent throughout the movie so I wouldn't disturb anyone.
   - There are coffee shops throughout the city, so you'll always find one nearby.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The company maintained consistent quality standards throughout the manufacturing process.
   - Throughout the twentieth century, technological innovations transformed global communication systems.

1. **Preposition**: through (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Moving in one side and out of the other side of an opening, space, or object
   - *(Temporal)* From the beginning to the end of a period of time
   - *(Abstract)* By means of; using as a method, agency, or intermediary
   
   **Synonyms**: via (in spatial/method contexts), by way of (in spatial contexts), by means of (in method contexts), during (in temporal contexts), from start to finish (in temporal contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: around (avoiding passage through), outside of, bypassing
   
   **When to Use**: Use "through" to indicate passage, penetration, or traversal across space; completion of a time period; or agency/means by which something is accomplished. Essential for describing processes, pathways, and methods.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when emphasizing continuous presence rather than passage (use "throughout" instead). Do not use for surface contact (use "on," "across"). Common learner errors: confusing "through" (passage) with "throughout" (comprehensive coverage), using "by" when "through" is needed for agency.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: through the door, through the window, through the years, through experience, through hard work, through the night
   - **Verb + prep**: go through, pass through, look through, get through, work through, see through
   - **Adjective + prep**: halfway through, partway through
   - **Noun + prep**: journey through, passage through, path through, way through
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple preposition (not compound)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English thurh (related to German durch) → Middle English thurgh/throgh → Modern English through. Proto-Germanic *thurkh, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *terkʷ- "to cross over."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I walked through the park on my way home from work.
   - She learned Spanish through watching TV shows and practicing with friends.

   - *(Spatial)* From one side to the other side of something; spanning the width or extent of a surface or space
   - *(Abstract)* Affecting or including all parts of a group, organization, or area
   
   **Synonyms**: over (in spatial contexts), throughout (when emphasizing comprehensive coverage), all over (in spatial contexts), spanning (in both contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: along (following the length), within a part of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "across" to emphasize horizontal or surface-level coverage, movement from one side to another, or distribution throughout a system. Common in descriptions of physical movement, organizational changes, and comparative analyses.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when emphasizing vertical movement (use "up," "down") or three-dimensional penetration (use "through"). Do not use when describing position without movement (use "on"). Common learner errors: confusing with "cross" (verb), overusing when "throughout" is more precise for temporal contexts.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: across the street, across the board, across the country, across the organization, across different sectors, across the table
   - **Verb + prep**: go across, walk across, spread across, extend across, cut across, come across
   - **Adjective + prep**: consistent across, visible across, effective across
   - **Noun + prep**: bridge across, journey across, movement across, comparison across
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + cross → on/to the other side via crossing
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English acros, from a- (on) + cros (cross) → Modern English across. Originally meant "in the form of a cross," evolved to mean "from side to side."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's walk across the bridge and grab lunch on the other side.
   - News about the sale spread across the neighborhood really fast.

1. **Preposition**: all over (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* In or to every part of a place or surface; covering the entire area
   - *(Abstract)* Affecting every aspect or element of something; completely
   
   **Synonyms**: throughout (in formal contexts), everywhere in, all across, over the entire
   
   **Antonyms**: in one spot, in limited areas, partially on
   
   **When to Use**: Use "all over" in informal contexts to emphasize complete spatial coverage or widespread distribution. More casual alternative to "throughout" when describing physical presence or extensive impact.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal academic or professional writing (use "throughout," "across," or "in all parts of" instead). Do not use for temporal duration (use "throughout"). Common learner errors: using in formal contexts where "throughout" is expected, confusing with "over" alone (which doesn't emphasize completeness).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: all over the place, all over the world, all over town, all over the map, all over the house, all over the news
   - **Verb + prep**: spread all over, scattered all over, known all over, travel all over
   - **Adjective + prep**: visible all over, available all over
   - **Noun + prep**: marks all over, stains all over, people all over
   
   **Root Analysis**: all (entire, complete) + over (covering surface/area)
   
   **Etymology**: Combination of Old English eall (all) + ofer (over). Phrasal preposition emphasizing complete coverage or distribution.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've been looking all over for my keys—have you seen them anywhere?
   - Her artwork is displayed all over the city in different galleries and cafes.

1. **Preposition**: during (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Throughout the continuance or course of a period of time; at some point in the course of
   
   **Synonyms**: throughout (emphasizing entire duration), in the course of, while, over the period of, in
   
   **Antonyms**: before, after, outside of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "during" to situate events, actions, or states within a time period. Can indicate either a specific moment within the period or the entire duration, depending on context. Essential for temporal framing in narratives and descriptions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid with duration expressions requiring "for" (e.g., "for three hours," not "during three hours"). Do not use when "throughout" better emphasizes continuous action across the entire period. Common learner errors: using "during" + duration instead of "for" + duration, confusing with "while" (which takes clauses).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: during the day, during the meeting, during the summer, during this time, during the week, during the war, during the process
   - **Verb + prep**: occur during, happen during, work during, study during, sleep during
   - **Adjective + prep**: active during, present during, available during
   - **Noun + prep**: activities during, events during, changes during
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple preposition (from Latin base)
   
   **Etymology**: Late Middle English from Latin durant- "lasting, enduring" (present participle of durare). Entered English via Old French durant, meaning "while something lasts."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I usually turn my phone off during movies so I won't get distracted.
   - She fell asleep during the boring presentation at work.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Significant economic reforms were implemented during the administration's first term.

1. **Preposition**: within (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Inside the limits or extent of a space, area, or object; not beyond the boundaries of
   - *(Temporal)* Before the end of a specified period; not exceeding a time limit
   - *(Abstract)* Inside the scope, range, or domain of something; falling under the category or authority of
   
   **Synonyms**: inside (in spatial contexts), in (in spatial contexts), in less than (in temporal contexts), under (in authority contexts), in the range of (in abstract contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: beyond, outside, outside of, exceeding
   
   **When to Use**: Use "within" to emphasize containment, limits, or boundaries in space, time, or abstract domains. Particularly useful for specifications, deadlines, jurisdictions, and defining scope. More formal than "in" or "inside."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when simple "in" suffices in casual contexts. Do not use for surface position (use "on"). Common learner errors: overusing "within" in casual speech (sounds overly formal), confusing spatial and temporal meanings, using when "among" is more appropriate for collective contexts.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: within reach, within limits, within the boundaries, within the organization, within a week, within the scope, within reason, within walking distance
   - **Verb + prep**: fall within, stay within, remain within, operate within, work within, fit within
   - **Adjective + prep**: contained within, located within, found within, available within
   - **Noun + prep**: area within, time within, range within, changes within
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (accompanying, against) + in (inside) → in the interior, inside
   
   **Etymology**: Old English withinnan (with + innan "inside") → Middle English within. Originally emphasized being "inside" with the added sense of "in the company of" or "in the interior of."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The grocery store is within walking distance, so we don't need to drive.
   - I should be able to finish this project within a couple of days.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All decisions must be made within the established regulatory framework.

1. **Preposition**: in (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Expressing the situation of being enclosed, surrounded by, or inside something
   - *(Temporal)* During, within the duration of, or at the end of a period of time
   - *(Abstract)* Expressing a state, condition, manner, or form
   
   **Synonyms**: inside (in spatial contexts), within (emphasizing limits), during (in temporal contexts), at (in some temporal contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: out, outside, out of, beyond
   
   **When to Use**: Use "in" as the most versatile and neutral preposition for location, time periods, and states. Appropriate across all registers and contexts for basic spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when surface contact is meant (use "on"). Do not use for specific times (use "at"). Do not use for days of the week (use "on"). Common learner errors: confusion with "on" and "at," L1 interference affecting choice, using "in" for surface position.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: in the room, in the morning, in a moment, in detail, in particular, in general, in fact, in summary, in conclusion, in comparison, in contrast
   - **Verb + prep**: result in, believe in, succeed in, engage in, participate in, invest in, specialize in, involve in

   - **Noun + prep**: increase in, change in, role in, interest in, confidence in
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple preposition (not compound)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English in (related to German in, Latin in, Greek en) → unchanged in Modern English. One of the most ancient prepositions in Indo-European languages, from Proto-Indo-European *en.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I left my jacket in the car—can you grab it for me?
   - Let's meet in about an hour at the usual place.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The findings are discussed in detail in the methodology section.
   - In recent years, significant advances have been made in renewable energy technology.

1. **Preposition**: over (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Above and covering; extending across the top or surface of something
   - *(Temporal)* During the course of; throughout a period
   - *(Abstract)* More than in number, degree, or quantity; concerning or about
   
   **Synonyms**: above (in spatial contexts), across (in spatial contexts), during (in temporal contexts), throughout (in temporal contexts), more than (in quantity contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: under, below, beneath, less than
   
   **When to Use**: Use "over" to indicate position above with possible contact or coverage, movement across a surface or space, duration of time, or excess in quantity. Versatile preposition appropriate across registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when emphasizing vertical position without coverage (use "above"). Do not use when "throughout" better captures continuous action. Common learner errors: confusing "over" (covering/crossing) with "above" (higher position), using "over" for all comparative contexts where "more than" is clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: over the years, over time, over the weekend, over the phone, over the top, all over, over and over, over the limit

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you throw that blanket over the couch so we can sit more comfortably?
   - I've been thinking this over for days and still can't decide.
