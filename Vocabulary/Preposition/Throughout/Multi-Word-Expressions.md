1. **Expression**: throughout the day (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During all parts of the day; continuously from morning to evening
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common, fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: all day long, during the entire day, the whole day, all day, from morning to night
   
   **Antonyms**: at certain times of day, during part of the day, briefly during the day
   
   **When to Use**: Common in descriptions of routines, schedules, symptoms, weather patterns, or any continuous daily occurrence. Appropriate across all registers. Essential for temporal specification in everyday and professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when referring to specific times rather than duration (use "at 3 p.m." instead). Not suitable when occurrence is intermittent (use "several times during the day"). Common learner error: using "during the day" when "throughout the day" better emphasizes continuity.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - throughout the entire day
   - throughout the whole day
   - throughout the business day
   - throughout the working day
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Throughout" naturally partners with bounded time periods, and "day" is a fundamental, frequently referenced time unit. The combination emphasizes continuous coverage within clear temporal boundaries.
   
   **Root Analysis**: throughout (comprehensive coverage) + the (definite article) + day (24-hour period) → comprehensive coverage of a day

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when discussing recent or specific historical periods (use "in the 20th century" or similar). Can sound grandiose in casual conversation about trivial topics. Learner error: overgeneralizing from limited historical evidence.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - throughout recorded history
   - throughout human history
   - throughout modern history
   - throughout ancient history
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **When to Use**: Common in descriptions of availability, climate patterns, events schedules, ongoing activities. Useful for emphasizing consistency across seasons. Appropriate across all registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when availability or occurrence is actually seasonal (misrepresents facts). Can be redundant with "year-round." Not suitable when specific months or seasons are more relevant than annual continuity.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - throughout the entire year
   - throughout the calendar year
   - throughout the fiscal year
   - throughout the academic year
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Throughout" emphasizes uninterrupted temporal coverage, and "year" is a fundamental cyclical time period. The combination stresses continuity across seasonal variations.
   
   **Root Analysis**: throughout (comprehensive coverage) + the year (twelve-month period) → comprehensive coverage of annual cycle

   **Common Variations**: 
   - throughout his/her/their life
   - throughout my/your/our lives
   - throughout the course of one's life
   - throughout adult life
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Throughout" emphasizes comprehensive temporal coverage, and "life" represents an individual's complete temporal existence. The combination creates expressions of lifelong persistence or commitment.
   
   **Root Analysis**: throughout (comprehensive coverage) + one's life (individual's lifetime) → comprehensive coverage of lifespan
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when referring to specific stages rather than the whole (use "during phase 2" instead). Can sound bureaucratic in casual contexts. Not suitable when variation across stages is the focus.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - throughout the entire process
   - throughout the whole process
   - throughout this process
   - throughout the development process
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Throughout" emphasizes comprehensive coverage, and "process" inherently has a beginning, middle, and end, making temporal completeness meaningful. The combination stresses end-to-end consistency or presence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: throughout (comprehensive coverage) + the process (systematic procedure) → comprehensive coverage of procedure
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Antonyms**: variable throughout, inconsistent throughout, changing throughout, uneven throughout
   
   **When to Use**: Common in evaluations, reviews, quality assessments, and analytical descriptions. Emphasizes reliability and uniformity. Appropriate across all registers, particularly in professional and academic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when variation is actually present (misrepresents reality). Can sound overly formal in casual conversation where "consistent" alone suffices. Not suitable when highlighting desirable variation or diversity.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - remain consistent throughout
   - stay consistent throughout
   - prove consistent throughout
   - be consistent throughout
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Consistent" emphasizes uniformity, and "throughout" emphasizes comprehensive scope. Together they create a powerful assertion of complete reliability or uniformity across space or time.
   
   **Root Analysis**: consistent (standing together, uniform) + throughout (comprehensive coverage) → uniform across complete scope
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The quality was consistent throughout—every episode was just as good as the first.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - spread rapidly throughout
   - spread widely throughout
   - spread gradually throughout
   - has spread throughout
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Spread" is an inherently spatial verb requiring scope specification, and "throughout" provides that scope while emphasizing comprehensive coverage. Natural semantic compatibility between dispersal action and comprehensive scope.
   
   **Root Analysis**: spread (extend over area) + throughout (comprehensive coverage) → extend across complete area
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - News about their engagement spread throughout the office in like five minutes.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - remained constant throughout
   - remained present throughout
   - remained consistent throughout
   - remained unchanged throughout
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Remain" emphasizes sustained state, and "throughout" emphasizes comprehensive temporal or spatial scope. Together they strongly emphasize unbroken continuity across complete scope.
   
   **Root Analysis**: remain (stay, continue in place) + throughout (comprehensive coverage) → stay across complete scope
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The main character's optimism remained throughout the story, even when things got really dark.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - available throughout the day/year/region
   - widely available throughout
   - readily available throughout
   - made available throughout
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Available" requires scope specification (when/where), and "throughout" provides comprehensive scope specification. Natural partnership for accessibility statements across time or space.
   
   **Root Analysis**: available (able to be obtained) + throughout (comprehensive coverage) → accessible across complete scope
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Coffee and snacks are available throughout the conference, so help yourself whenever.
