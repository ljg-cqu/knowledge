1. **Expression**: in relation to (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to show what something is about, or how it should be understood, by explicitly linking it to a topic, reference point, or comparison

   - directly in proportion to
   - roughly in proportion to
   - in proportion to the size/scale of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: *Proportion* almost always appears with *to* when it highlights the comparison base.
