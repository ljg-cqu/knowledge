1. **Linking Word**: before (type: subordinating conjunction / preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At an earlier time than; preceding in time (temporal relationship)
   - *Function*: Connects two events or states, establishing temporal precedence of one over the other
   
   **Synonyms**: prior to (formal), ahead of, in advance of, earlier than
   
   **Antonyms**: after, following, subsequent to, later than, once
   
   **When to Use**: All registers and contexts when expressing temporal sequence, both formal and informal writing and speech, when introducing subordinate clauses about earlier events
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When events are simultaneous (use "while" or "as"), when expressing causation without temporal sequence (use "because"), when formality requires "prior to" in official documents
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + before + [dependent clause with subject + verb]
   - [Clause structure]: Before + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (followed by comma) or mid-sentence (no comma before "before")
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma after introductory "before" clause; no comma when "before" clause follows main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Comma splice (incorrect: "I finished the work, before leaving"); using present tense in "before" clause when past is needed
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by, about) + fore (front) (Old English compound)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "beforan" (in front of, earlier than) → Middle English "before" → Modern English (both temporal and spatial meanings preserved)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Call me before you leave, okay?"
   - "I always check my email before going to bed."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Before implementing the new policy, the committee conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders."
   - "Applicants must submit all required documentation before their applications can be processed."

2. **Linking Word**: after (type: subordinating conjunction / preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Following in time; later than (temporal relationship)
   - *Function*: Connects two events or states, establishing that one occurs subsequent to the other
   
   **Synonyms**: following, subsequent to (formal), once, when
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, ahead of, preceding
   
   **When to Use**: All registers when expressing events that follow in time, indicating sequence where one event completes before another begins, formal and informal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simultaneity is intended (use "while"), when immediate consequence is emphasized (use "as soon as"), when causation rather than sequence is key (use "because")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + after + [dependent clause]
   - [Clause structure]: After + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (followed by comma) or mid-sentence (no comma)
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "after" clause; no comma when "after" clause follows main
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Redundancy with "after...then" (incorrect: "After I finish, then I'll call"); confusion with "afterwards" (adverb)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple form from Old English "æfter"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "æfter" (behind in place, later in time) → Middle English "after" → Modern English (spatial meaning largely obsolete, temporal primary)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Let's grab dinner after the movie ends."
   - "I felt much better after talking to her."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "After completing the initial assessment, the team will develop a comprehensive implementation plan."
   - "The contract becomes effective after both parties have executed the agreement."

3. **Linking Word**: until (type: subordinating conjunction / preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Up to the point in time when; up to the time that (duration with endpoint)
   - *Function*: Indicates continuous state or action that terminates at a specified time or event
   
   **Synonyms**: till, up to, up until, as far as
   
   **Antonyms**: from, since (indicate starting points rather than endpoints)
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing duration continuing up to a specific endpoint, both formal and informal contexts, when the action/state stops at the mentioned time
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When expressing a deadline by which something should be completed (use "by"), when indicating starting points (use "since" or "from"), when the action continues beyond the point mentioned
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause with durative verb] + until + [time/event]
   - [Clause structure]: Until + [time/event], [negative or durative clause]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence after main clause, or sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "until" clause; generally no comma when following main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "until" (duration) with "by" (deadline); using "until" with punctual verbs incorrectly
   
   **Root Analysis**: un- (as far as) + til (to, towards)
   
   **Etymology**: Old Norse "und" + Old English "til" → Middle English "until" (12th century) → Modern English (emphasizes duration to endpoint)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I'll wait here until you get back."
   - "We can't start until everyone arrives."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The provisional measures shall remain in effect until such time as permanent arrangements are established."
   - "Confidentiality obligations continue until the information enters the public domain."

4. **Linking Word**: once (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - As soon as; at the moment that; from the time when (immediate sequence or enabling condition)
   - *Function*: Connects two events where the first enables or immediately precedes the second
   
   **Synonyms**: as soon as, when, after, the moment that
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, until
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that one event enables or triggers another, indicating immediate consequence or sequence, both formal and informal contexts, when conditional relationship is present
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When significant time gap exists between events (use "after"), when simultaneity is meant (use "while"), when simple past sequence without enabling relationship (use "after")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Once + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + once + [dependent clause]
   - [Position]: often sentence-initial for emphasis on condition; mid-sentence for standard sequence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "once" clause; optional comma when "once" clause follows
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Overuse in formal writing (vary with "after," "when"); confusing with "once" meaning "one time"
   
   **Root Analysis**: From "one" + "-s" (adverbial suffix) → conjunction use developed
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "ānes" (once, one time) → Middle English extension to temporal conjunction → Modern English (primary use as conjunction indicating enabling condition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Once you finish that, we can go."
   - "Everything got easier once I figured out the system."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Once the regulatory approvals are secured, the project may proceed to the implementation phase."
   - "The data will be made publicly available once the peer review process is complete."

5. **Linking Word**: when (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At or during the time that; at the moment that (temporal relationship, often simultaneous or triggering)
   - *Function*: Introduces temporal clause indicating when the main clause action occurs
   
   **Synonyms**: as, while (for simultaneous), once, at the time that
   
   **Antonyms**: (No direct antonyms; contrasts with "before" and "after" for sequencing)
   
   **When to Use**: All registers, indicating time of action or event, introducing temporal subordinate clauses, both specific moments and general time periods
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When emphasizing sequence rather than simultaneity (use "after" or "before"), when duration is emphasized (use "while"), in very formal legal language where precision requires more specific temporal markers
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: When + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + when + [dependent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "when" clause; no comma when "when" clause follows main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using future tense after "when" in time clauses (incorrect: "when I will finish"); confusing with "if" (conditional)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "hwænne" (at what time, when)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwænne" → Middle English "whan/when" → Modern English (interrogative and conjunction uses)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "When I heard the news, I couldn't believe it."
   - "Let me know when you're ready."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "When the committee convenes in April, it will review all submitted proposals."
   - "Notification will be sent to all stakeholders when the decision has been finalized."

6. **Linking Word**: while (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the time that; at the same time as (simultaneous actions or states)
   - *Function*: Indicates that two actions or states occur at the same time, emphasizing temporal overlap
   
   **Synonyms**: as, whilst (British formal), during the time that
   
   **Antonyms**: before, after (indicate sequence rather than simultaneity)
   
   **When to Use**: All registers, when emphasizing simultaneous or overlapping actions, indicating contrast between concurrent events, duration during which something occurs
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When events are sequential rather than simultaneous (use "before" or "after"), when instant moment is meant rather than duration (use "when"), in very concise writing where "as" is shorter
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: While + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + while + [dependent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (emphasizes simultaneity) or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "while" clause; optional comma when "while" follows
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing with contrast "while" (although); using with punctual verbs incorrectly (needs durative aspect)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "hwīl" (period of time, while)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwīl" (time period) → Middle English "while" (noun and conjunction) → Modern English (conjunction primary, noun archaic)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I'll watch the kids while you run to the store."
   - "She listened to music while working on her project."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "While the initial results are promising, further research is needed to establish causation."
   - "Participants may not communicate with each other while the assessment is in progress."

7. **Linking Word**: as soon as (type: compound subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Immediately when; at the very moment that (immediate temporal sequence)
   - *Function*: Emphasizes minimal or no delay between two events, creates sense of immediacy
   
   **Synonyms**: once, the moment that, immediately when, directly after
   
   **Antonyms**: long after, eventually after, well before
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing immediacy of response or sequence, both formal and informal contexts, when highlighting causal or enabling relationship with no delay
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When delay is expected or acceptable (use "after" or "when"), in legal contexts requiring precise temporal specifications, when understatement is preferable to urgency
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: As soon as + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + as soon as + [dependent clause]
   - [Position]: often sentence-initial to emphasize prompt action requirement
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "as soon as" clause; optional comma when following
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using future tense in "as soon as" clause (incorrect: "as soon as I will arrive"); redundancy with "immediately" (already implied)
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (temporal) + soon (without delay) + as (comparative/temporal marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English combination of comparative construction → Modern English fixed phrase (16th century onward as temporal conjunction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Call me as soon as you land, okay?"
   - "I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Corrective action must be initiated as soon as the deficiency is identified."
   - "As soon as the audit is complete, a comprehensive report will be distributed to all board members."
