1. **Functional Expression**: Could you complete this prior to [time/event]? (function: requesting with formal politeness)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request asking someone to finish a task before a specified deadline
   - *Formality*: formal to very formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (softened by modal "could" and formal "prior to")
   
   **Synonyms**: Could you finish this before [time]?, Would you be able to complete this ahead of [time]?, Can you have this done by [time]?
   
   **Antonyms**: You must complete this after [time], Please begin this following [event]
   
   **When to Use**: Professional settings with colleagues or superiors, formal written requests, contexts requiring politeness and respect, when addressing those with equal or higher status
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Urgent situations requiring direct commands, casual conversations with close colleagues, when addressing subordinates in emergency situations (too indirect)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Could you please complete this prior to [time]? (more polite with "please")
   - Would you be able to complete this prior to [time]? (slightly more tentative)
   - I would appreciate if you could complete this prior to [time] (very formal, extremely polite)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses negative politeness strategy (respecting autonomy), modal "could" suggests optionality even when compliance is expected, "prior to" adds formality weight
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Certainly, I'll have it ready prior to [time]" / "Yes, of course" / "No problem"
   - Declining: "I'm afraid that timeline may be challenging" / "I'll try my best, but [obstacle]" / "Would [alternative time] work?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Hey, can you finish this before Friday?" (More natural in casual contexts)
   - "Could you wrap this up before the meeting?" (Semi-formal)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Could you complete the financial analysis prior to the board meeting on Thursday?"
   - "I would appreciate if you could submit your review prior to the end of business today."

2. **Functional Expression**: It would be advisable to [action] prior to [event] (function: suggesting formally/recommending)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal suggestion or recommendation to take action before a specified time
   - *Formality*: very formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (hedged with "would be advisable")
   
   **Synonyms**: I would recommend [action] before [event], You might want to [action] ahead of [event], It would be wise to [action] before [event]
   
   **Antonyms**: You should avoid [action] before [event], It's unnecessary to [action] prior to [event]
   
   **When to Use**: Professional advice-giving, consulting contexts, senior advisors to decision-makers, formal recommendations in reports or memos
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual advice among peers, urgent warnings (too hedged), direct instructions to subordinates, friendly suggestions
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - It would be wise to [action] prior to [event] (slightly less formal)
   - I would strongly advise [action] prior to [event] (more emphatic)
   - One might consider [action] prior to [event] (very formal, academic tone)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Heavy hedging with "would be" + "advisable" distances speaker from direct command, appropriate for advice upward or lateral in hierarchy, maintains face for both parties
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Thank you for the advice, I'll proceed accordingly" / "That's a good point, I'll make sure to do that"
   - Considering: "I'll take that under advisement" / "That's worth considering"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "You might want to check that before submitting." (More natural)
   - "Maybe you should do this before the deadline?" (Casual suggestion)

   - "It would be advisable to conduct a thorough risk assessment prior to implementation."
   - "In my professional opinion, it would be advisable to secure board approval prior to announcing the merger."

3. **Functional Expression**: Prior to [action], we should/must/need to [preparatory action] (function: sequencing actions/expressing prerequisites)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Establishes logical sequence by stating necessary preparatory steps before main action
   - *Formality*: formal to neutral (depending on modal verb choice)
   - *Directness*: direct (clear sequence, though "prior to" adds formality)
   
   **Synonyms**: Before [action], we should [prep action], Ahead of [action], we need to [prep action], We must [prep action] before [action]
   
   **Antonyms**: After [action], we should [follow-up], Following [action], we need to [next step]
   
   **When to Use**: Project planning, process documentation, establishing workflows, clarifying prerequisites, formal procedures
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversations about simple tasks, when "before" would be clearer, over-explaining obvious sequences
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Prior to launching, we should test thoroughly (neutral professional)
   - Prior to implementation, we must obtain approval (formal, obligatory)
   - Before we start, we need to prepare (casual alternative)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Prior to" signals formal planning context, choice of modal verb ("should" vs "must" vs "need to") indicates degree of obligation, used to establish clear dependencies in processes
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Agreement: "Agreed, that's a necessary prerequisite" / "Yes, that makes sense" / "Good point"
   - Questioning: "Is that step absolutely necessary?" / "Can we do those in parallel?" / "What if we skip that?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Before we launch, we should probably test it thoroughly." (More natural)
   - "We need to get approval before we start." (Clear and direct)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Prior to initiating the clinical trial, we must obtain IRB approval and secure patient consent."
   - "Prior to executing the contract, all stakeholders should review the terms and conditions carefully."

4. **Functional Expression**: Just to clarify, this needs to be done prior to [time/event], correct? (function: clarifying/confirming understanding)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Seeks confirmation about a deadline or temporal requirement
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (hedged with "just to clarify" and tag question "correct?")
   
   **Synonyms**: Just to confirm, this is due before [time]?, To clarify, the deadline is before [event]?, So this needs to be finished by [time], right?
   
   **Antonyms**: (Not applicable for clarification questions)
   
   **When to Use**: Confirming instructions, checking understanding of deadlines, ensuring alignment on timing, professional communication where clarity is crucial
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you're completely certain (sounds unnecessarily tentative), repeatedly asking the same question (shows inattention)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just to confirm, this is due prior to [time]? (slightly more formal)
   - So, to be clear, we need this before [time], right? (casual)
   - If I understand correctly, the deadline is prior to [event]? (very polite)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Just to clarify" is a face-saving hedge that frames potential misunderstanding as joint responsibility, tag question "correct?" or "right?" invites confirmation without challenging authority
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Confirming: "Yes, that's correct" / "Exactly" / "Yes, prior to [time]"
   - Correcting: "Actually, it's before [different time]" / "Not quite, let me clarify..." / "Close, but [correction]"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Just to confirm, you need this before Friday, right?"
   - "So wait, this is due before the meeting?"

   - "To confirm my understanding, all materials should be distributed to participants prior to the conference commencement, is that accurate?"

5. **Functional Expression**: I'm afraid this won't be possible prior to [time] (function: refusing politely/explaining constraints)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Politely declines or explains inability to meet a deadline
   - *Formality*: formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (softened with "I'm afraid" and formal "prior to")
   
   **Synonyms**: Unfortunately, I can't complete this before [time], I won't be able to finish this ahead of [time], This won't be feasible by [time]
   
   **Antonyms**: I can definitely complete this prior to [time], No problem, I'll have it ready before [time]
   
   **When to Use**: Declining requests professionally, explaining capacity constraints, communicating delays, managing expectations with clients or superiors
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With close colleagues in casual settings (too formal), when simple "no" suffices, when refusing without offering alternatives (sounds unhelpful)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I'm afraid that won't be possible before [time] (slightly less formal)
   - Unfortunately, I won't be able to complete this prior to [time] (very formal)
   - I'm not sure I can make it happen prior to [time] (hedged, less certain)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "I'm afraid" is a conventional formula for bad news in formal English, using "prior to" maintains formality while delivering negative message, should ideally follow with alternative or explanation
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "I understand, when would be feasible?" / "What timeline would work better?"
   - Negotiating: "What if we adjusted the scope?" / "Is [alternative date] too late?" / "Can we prioritize certain aspects?"

6. **Functional Expression**: In order to meet the deadline, we'll need to [action] prior to [earlier time] (function: explaining necessity/setting intermediate deadlines)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explains causal relationship between early preparation and meeting final deadline
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: direct (clear cause-effect relationship)
   
   **Synonyms**: To meet the deadline, we need to [action] before [earlier time], If we want to finish on time, we should [action] ahead of [time]
   
   **Antonyms**: (Not applicable - causal explanation)
   
   **When to Use**: Project planning, explaining dependencies, setting intermediate milestones, managing team expectations, breaking down timelines
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When stating obvious sequences, over-explaining to experienced team members, when simpler language would be clearer
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - To meet the deadline, we'll need to [action] before [time] (semi-formal)
   - If we're going to hit our target, we need to [action] by [time] (motivational)
   - [Action] must occur prior to [time] in order to meet our commitments (very formal)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "In order to" explicitly marks causal/purpose relationship, creates shared understanding of why early action is needed, frames requirement as logical consequence rather than arbitrary demand
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Understanding: "That makes sense, I'll adjust my schedule" / "Understood, thanks for clarifying the timeline"
   - Questioning: "Is that timeline realistic?" / "What if we can't meet that intermediate deadline?" / "Can we get additional resources?"
