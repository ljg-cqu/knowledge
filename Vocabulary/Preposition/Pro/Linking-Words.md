1. **Linking Word**: in favour of (type: connector/prepositional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Expresses support or preference for one option, person, or policy over another.
   - *Function*: Presents the pro side in choices, debates, and evaluations.
   
   **Synonyms**: for, supportive of, on the side of, backing, inclined towards
   
   **Antonyms**: against, opposed to, in favour of not doing X, in favour of the alternative
   
   **When to Use**: When stating clearly which option you are pro, especially in careful spoken or written argument ("in favour of the pro-environment plan").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech where "for" is simpler ("I'm for it"). Do not use *in favour to* (incorrect preposition); always *in favour of*.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: be in favour of + noun/‑ing
   - [Subject] + be + in favour of + [option]
   - [Subject] + vote + in favour of + [proposal]
   - **Position**: mid‑clause or clause‑final: "They are in favour of option A." / "Most voters, in favour of reform, ..."
   - **Punctuation**: commas only when used as an inserted phrase
   - **Common errors to avoid**: *in favour to*, *in the favour of* (both incorrect in this meaning)
   
   **Root Analysis**: `in` (inside, with) + `favour` (approval, support) + `of` (relational preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *faveur* and Latin *favor* (goodwill, support). The phrase "in favour of" became a standard way to express support in legal and parliamentary English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm definitely in favour of a more pro-environment policy.
   - Most of the team are in favour of going fully remote.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A clear majority of respondents were in favour of the pro-democracy reforms.
   - The committee voted in favour of a strongly pro-customer compensation scheme.

1. **Linking Word**: for (type: coordinating/connector in pro–con framing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces the pro side when presenting arguments ("for or against"); also marks which choice you support ("vote for").
   - *Function*: Signals support, reasons on the pro side, or the chosen option in a binary decision.
   
   **Synonyms**: in favour of, on the side of, backing, in support of
   
   **Antonyms**: against, versus, opposed to
   
   **When to Use**: In concise speech and writing when marking which option is supported ("arguments for and against", "you can vote for either option").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use `for` instead of `because` in very formal writing; keep it for choices and support rather than causal explanations.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: 
   - for or against + noun/‑ing
   - arguments for and against + [issue]
   - vote for + [candidate/proposal]
   - be for + [idea] (informal: "I'm for this plan.")
   - **Position**: before the supported element or in paired lists (pros and cons → for and against)
   - **Punctuation**: no special punctuation inside phrases
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English `for` (on account of, in support of)
   
   **Etymology**: From Proto‑Germanic *fur*; in English long used to express purpose and support. In pro–con contexts it marks the pro side.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Are you for or against the new pro-environment tax?
   - I'm for giving this pro-innovation idea a chance.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The report sets out the main arguments for and against the pro-market package.
   - Members were asked to vote for or against the proposed pro-labour amendment.

1. **Linking Word**: on the plus side (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces positive points in favour of something, often after mentioning problems.
   - *Function*: Marks a shift back to pro arguments or advantages.
   
   **Synonyms**: on the positive side, the upside is, the advantage is, on the pro side
   
   **Antonyms**: on the minus side, on the downside, however, nevertheless
   
   **When to Use**: In spoken and informal written English when balancing pros and cons: "On the plus side, it's very pro-customer." 
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing; use "an advantage is that" or "a key benefit is that" instead.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: On the plus side, + [clause]
   - **Position**: Sentence‑initial discourse marker
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after the phrase when sentence‑initial
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Mixing with formal connectors in the same sentence ("On the plus side, however, ..." is usually redundant).
   
   **Root Analysis**: `on` (locative preposition) + `the plus side` (metaphor: positive column in a pros/cons table)
   
   **Etymology**: Late 20th‑century idiom from everyday comparisons of "pros and cons" with visual plus/minus columns.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - On the plus side, the policy is very pro-environment.
   - The plan is risky, but on the plus side it's strongly pro-customer.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The measure entails higher short‑term costs; on the plus side, it is clearly pro-labour.

1. **Linking Word**: on the other hand (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces the opposing, often less pro, side of an argument, typically after presenting pros.
   - *Function*: Signals contrast between pro arguments and counter‑arguments.
   
   **Synonyms**: by contrast, conversely, in contrast, at the same time
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, in the same way
   
   **When to Use**: When weighing pros and cons in balanced discussion: "Some see this as pro-business; on the other hand, workers may lose protections."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the second point is not truly contrasting but simply additional; then use "in addition" or "furthermore".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: On the other hand, + [contrasting clause]
   - **Position**: Typically sentence‑initial; occasionally mid‑sentence within parentheses
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after the phrase when initial; set off by commas if mid‑clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using without a clear first hand ("On the one hand") in very formal writing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: idiomatic phrase: `hand` = side of an issue
   
   **Etymology**: From physical metaphor of two hands representing two sides; paired with "on the one hand" in structured pro–con arguments.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The idea is very pro-innovation; on the other hand, it might overwhelm the team.
   - He's clearly pro-technology; on the other hand, he worries about privacy.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Linking Word**: as opposed to (type: connector/prepositional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explicitly contrasts one option with another, often pro vs anti or two pro options.
   - *Function*: Highlights a clear distinction between what is supported and what is not.
   
   **Synonyms**: rather than, instead of, as distinct from, in contrast to
   
   **Antonyms**: similar to, in line with, consistent with
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to draw a sharp line between camps: "pro-democracy as opposed to authoritarian solutions".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the difference is minor or when nuance is more important than sharp contrast.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: X, as opposed to Y
   - **Position**: mid‑clause after comma or clause‑final
   - **Punctuation**: Usually preceded by a comma in written English
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Doubling with "compared to" (*as opposed to compared to* is redundant).
   
   **Root Analysis**: `as` (in the role of) + past participle `opposed` (set against) + `to`
   
   **Etymology**: From verb `oppose`; phrase developed in English as a compact contrast marker.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm pro-customer as opposed to pro‑short‑term profit.
   - They went for a pro-environment option as opposed to the cheapest one.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The party positions itself as pro-European, as opposed to explicitly nationalist alternatives.

   - *Function*: Strengthens the perception of difference between pro and non‑pro positions.
   
   **Synonyms**: in contrast, conversely, on the other hand, whereas
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, in the same way, likewise
   
   **When to Use**: In formal writing when you want a clear, compact contrast between two stances: "One option is strongly pro-labour; by contrast, the other is unequivocally pro-business."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very informal speech where "but" or "on the other hand" is more natural.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Sentence 1. By contrast, sentence 2.
   - **Position**: Sentence‑initial; occasionally after semicolon
   - **Punctuation**: Capitalised at sentence start; comma after the phrase
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using after an already strong contrast marker in the same position ("however, by contrast" is usually too heavy).
   
   **Root Analysis**: `by` (indicating means) + `contrast` (difference)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *contrastare* (stand against); became a standard academic transition in English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This policy is really pro-environment. By contrast, the old one ignored climate issues.
   - Our competitors are pro-technology; by contrast, we've been slow to adopt new tools.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The first scenario is strongly pro-consumer; by contrast, the second primarily benefits incumbents.

1. **Linking Word**: therefore (type: logical connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a conclusion drawn from previously listed pros; means "for that reason".
   - *Function*: Connects pro arguments to a final recommendation or decision.
   
   **Synonyms**: thus, consequently, as a result, hence
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, nonetheless, despite this
   
   **When to Use**: In formal argumentation where you move from reasons (pros) to a clear pro conclusion ("the evidence is pro-X; therefore, we support X").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual talk ("so" is more natural), or when the relationship between pros and conclusion is weak.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Reasons]. Therefore, + [conclusion].
   - **Position**: Sentence‑initial or after a semicolon
   - **Punctuation**: Semicolon before and comma after when joining two independent clauses; comma after when sentence‑initial
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Overusing in short, informal texts; using without a clearly stated basis.
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (that) + fore (for that reason)
   
   **Etymology**: From Middle English, combining deictic "there" and preposition "for" (spelled *fore* in older English).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This approach is more pro-customer and pro-environment; therefore, it just feels right.
   - The pros clearly outweigh the cons; therefore, I'm in favour.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposal is simultaneously pro-labour and pro-innovation; therefore, the committee recommends adoption.
