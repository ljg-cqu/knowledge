1. **Preposition**: pro (type: simple/Latin loan)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Not applicable
   - *(Temporal)* Not applicable
   - *(Abstract)* In favour of or supporting a person, idea, policy, or side in a debate; on the side of something rather than against it. In some fixed uses, also "on behalf of" or "as, in the role of".
   
   **Synonyms**: for, in favour of, on the side of, backing, supportive of
   
   **Antonyms**: against, opposed to, anti-, hostile to
   
   **When to Use**: Use `pro` informally to label someone's stance ("I'm pro this change", "a pro-environment government"), in political or ethical debates (pro-democracy, pro-choice, pro-union), and when contrasting supporters with opponents (the pro camp vs the anti camp).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid `pro` alone in very formal writing where `in favour of` or `supporting` is clearer. Do not confuse `pro` as a preposition with `pro` meaning "professional" (a golf pro) or with the prefix `pro-` in words like `proactive` where it no longer feels like a separate preposition.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: pro change, pro reform, pro peace, pro democracy, pro science, pro worker, pro business
   - **Verb + prep**: come out pro [policy], vote pro [motion] (rare, more often *vote for*), lean pro [side]
   - **Adjective + prep**: strongly pro, openly pro, firmly pro, mildly pro
   - **Noun + prep**: the pro camp, a pro voice, pro lobby, pro side
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin `pro` (for, on behalf of, in front of)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin `pro` meaning "for, on behalf of". Entered English largely through Latin legal and academic expressions and is now also used as a clipped informal preposition marking support ("pro vs anti").
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm pro this idea as long as we keep the costs under control.
   - Most of the team are pro remote work, but a few people are still against it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organisation is explicitly pro-democracy and supports peaceful constitutional reform.
   - Survey data indicate that a clear majority of respondents are pro the proposed regulation.

1. **Preposition**: pro bono (type: Latin phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Not applicable
   - *(Temporal)* Not applicable
   - *(Abstract)* For the public good; describing professional work done without charge, typically to benefit people or causes that cannot pay.
   
   **Synonyms**: free of charge (in legal/service contexts), unpaid, voluntary, for the public good
   
   **Antonyms**: paid, fee-based, billable, commercial
   
   **When to Use**: Use `pro bono` mainly for professional services (especially legal, consulting, medical or design work) provided free to individuals, charities or the wider community for ethical or social reasons.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use `pro bono` for ordinary favours between friends (just say "for free"). Avoid in casual contexts where it sounds unnecessarily technical or self-important. Do not use when a reduced fee, not zero fee, is charged (use "discounted" or "subsidised").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: pro bono work, pro bono services, act pro bono, do something pro bono publico
   - **Verb + prep**: work pro bono, represent clients pro bono, take on cases pro bono, offer advice pro bono
   - **Adjective + prep**: available pro bono, provided pro bono
   - **Noun + prep**: commitment to pro bono, pro bono requirement, pro bono programme
   
   **Root Analysis**: `pro` (for) + `bono` (good) from Latin `pro bono publico` (for the public good)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin legal phrase `pro bono publico` (for the public good) shortened in English to `pro bono`, especially in legal practice from the 20th century onward.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She does some pro bono legal work for a local charity.

   - *(Temporal)* Not applicable
   - *(Abstract)* In proportion; allocated or calculated according to each person's share, time period, or contribution.
   
   **Synonyms**: proportionally, in proportion, according to share, on a proportional basis

   **When to Use**: Use `pro rata` in financial, legal, HR, and operations contexts when allocating money, time, benefits, or resources according to a fraction (e.g., part-year salary, part-time benefits, partial refunds).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual contexts where "in proportion" or "based on how much" is clearer. Do not use when an equal (non-proportional) split is intended.

   - **Prepositional phrases**: pro rata share, pro rata basis, pro rata payment, pro rata refund, calculated pro rata
   - **Verb + prep**: calculate pro rata, pay pro rata, allocate pro rata, adjust pro rata, refund pro rata
   - **Adjective + prep**: pro rata entitlement, pro rata salary
   - **Noun + prep**: distribution pro rata, adjustment pro rata
   
   **Root Analysis**: `pro` (for, according to) + `rata` (rate, reckoning, from Latin `ratus` = calculated)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin `pro rata parte` (for the calculated part). Entered English financial and legal language in the 17th century and is now standard terminology.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Not applicable
   - *(Temporal)* Not applicable
   - *(Abstract)* As a matter of form; done to satisfy formal requirements rather than to have real effect. Also used for documents or statements that are preliminary or for illustration only (e.g., `pro forma` invoice, `pro forma` accounts).

   **Antonyms**: substantive, binding, final, definitive, fully operative
   
   **When to Use**: Use `pro forma` in business, finance, legal, and administrative contexts for draft or illustrative documents and for actions done only because procedure requires it.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in everyday conversation when "draft", "example", or "formal only" is clearer. Do not use for documents that are legally binding or final.

   - **Prepositional phrases**: pro forma invoice, pro forma budget, pro forma accounts, pro forma meeting, pro forma approval
   - **Verb + prep**: issue pro forma, prepare pro forma, treat as pro forma, approve pro forma

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use `pro tempore` or `pro tem` in formal or semi-formal contexts, especially for temporary office-holders (e.g., President pro tempore, chair pro tem) or temporary arrangements.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for most casual speech—"for now" or "acting" is usually better. Avoid when the position is not clearly temporary.

   - **Verb + prep**: serve pro tempore, act pro tem, sit pro tempore

   - **Verb + prep**: administer pro re nata, meet pro re nata, act pro re nata

   **When to Use**: Use `pro hac vice` only in legal contexts, mainly in common-law jurisdictions, to describe one-off admission or permission.

   - **Verb + prep**: weigh the pros and cons of, list the pros and cons of, argue pro and con about
