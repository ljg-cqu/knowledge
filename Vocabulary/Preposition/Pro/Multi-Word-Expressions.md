   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Latin phrase meaning "for the good" (short for *pro bono publico*). Adopted by professional communities to label work done in service of society rather than profit.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin `pro` (for) + `bono` (good, from *bonus*)

   **Synonyms**: for the public good, in the public interest, for society's benefit
   
   **Antonyms**: for private gain, self‑interested, purely commercial
   
   **When to Use**: Rare in everyday speech; used in formal, ceremonial, or historical contexts to stress the public‑service dimension of pro work.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - act pro bono publico
   - work done pro bono publico
   - awards for service pro bono publico
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Classical Latin phrase that later inspired the shorter professional term "pro bono". The full form is kept for emphasis and tradition.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - pro rata salary
   - pro rata share

   - calculated pro rata
   - pro rata entitlement
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - allocated on a pro rata basis
   - charged on a pro rata basis
   - calculated on a pro rata basis
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines the Latin phrase with English legal‑bureaucratic formula "on a ... basis" to highlight calculation method.
   
   **Root Analysis**: `pro rata` (in proportion) + `basis` (underlying method or rule)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We'll split the rent on a pro rata basis, depending on room size.

   - pro forma invoice
   - pro forma budget
   - pro forma accounts
   - sign off pro forma
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Latin for "for the sake of form"; borrowed into English to describe actions and documents that exist mainly to satisfy formal expectations.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They sent us a pro forma invoice so we could get the payment approved.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - the pros and cons of [doing X]

   - consider the pros and cons
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Shortened from Latin *pro et contra* (for and against). The English binomial "pros and cons" is highly conventional and processed as a single chunk by fluent speakers.
   
   **Root Analysis**: `pros` (from Latin `pro`, for) + `cons` (from Latin `contra`, against)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's go over the pros and cons before we decide.
