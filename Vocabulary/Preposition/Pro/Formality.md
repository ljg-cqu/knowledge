   *Use when*: General workplace discussions, emails among colleagues, internal meetings.

   *Use when*: Presentations, written reports, meeting minutes, communication with senior stakeholders.
   
   **Humorous**: I'm firmly in the pro‑this‑idea camp.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor "camp"; light exaggeration; playful framing of being on the "pro" side.  
   *Use when*: Friendly teams, informal presentations, situations where mild humour is welcome.

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With senior stakeholders, prefer "I am in favour of this proposal"; with peers, "I support this idea" works well.  
   - *Social Distance*: Use casual or humorous variants only with people you know well.  
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high‑stakes or controversial topics, choose semi‑formal or formal forms.  
   - *Cultural Context*: In some cultures, strong first‑person statements ("I'm totally pro…") may be seen as too direct.  
   - *Medium*: Email and documents favour semi‑formal or formal variants; spoken meetings allow more casual flexibility.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "I'm pro" with no object in formal writing (too vague; specify *what* you support).  
   - Overusing intensifiers like "totally" in professional emails—can sound childish or unprofessional.  
   - Using humorous metaphors ("camp") in tense or sensitive meetings.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some workplace cultures, openly declaring "I'm pro this" can feel confrontational if seniors expect more hedged language ("I tend to support…"). Adjust directness accordingly.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Small internal meeting among peers → **Appropriate Variant**: "I support this idea." (clear but not over‑dramatic)  
   - **Situation 2**: Formal presentation to executives → **Appropriate Variant**: "I am in favour of this proposal."  
   - **Situation 3**: Informal team brainstorm → **Appropriate Variant**: "I'm all in for this idea!" (adds energy and enthusiasm)

   **Register Selection Guide**:

   - *Social Distance*: Use neutral or formal language with new partners; save humour for established relationships.  
   - *Gravity of Situation*: In crisis or compliance contexts, choose formal, precise wording and avoid jokes.  
   - *Cultural Context*: In some markets, public environmental claims are scrutinised; avoid exaggerated humour that could be read as "greenwashing".  
   - *Medium*: Short, lively variants suit slides and posters; formal variants suit long‑form documents.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using humorous lines when announcing serious environmental impacts or risks.  
   - Claiming to be "strongly" pro‑environment while describing only minor actions—can damage credibility.  
   - Over‑promising with emotional language without backing it up with concrete policies.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Expectations around pro‑environment claims differ; in some countries, regulators tightly control environmental marketing language. Ensure that "pro‑environment" statements are accurate and verifiable.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: ESG section of an annual report → **Appropriate Variant**: "The organisation is explicitly committed to pro‑environment policies."  
   - **Situation 2**: Internal all‑hands → **Appropriate Variant**: "We're proudly and actively pro‑environment!"

   - *Gravity of Situation*: Avoid humour if people have suffered because of a lack of democracy.  
   - *Cultural Context*: In some settings, calling a party "pro‑democracy" can be politically charged; neutral descriptions may be safer.

   - Combining highly emotional or humorous language with reports of violence or repression.  
   - Ignoring local self‑descriptions and imposing "pro‑/anti‑democracy" labels from outside.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Different political systems may frame "democracy" differently; what counts as a "pro‑democracy" platform can be contested. Writers should be transparent about their criteria.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Neutral news report → **Appropriate Variant**: "The party ran on a pro‑democracy platform."  
   - **Situation 2**: Academic analysis of party systems → **Appropriate Variant**: "The party contested the election on an explicitly pro‑democracy platform."  
   - **Situation 3**: Civic education workshop → **Appropriate Variant**: "They ran on a pro‑democracy platform that promised people a genuine voice in how they are governed."
