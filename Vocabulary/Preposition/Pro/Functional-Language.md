1. **Functional Expression**: I'm pro [NOUN / -ing]. (function: expressing opinion/support)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Statement of personal support for an idea, action, or policy using the preposition `pro`.
   - *Formality*: informal/neutral (context-dependent)  
   - *Directness*: direct (speaker states position clearly)
   
   **Synonyms**: I'm in favour of [X]., I support [X]., I'm for [X]., I'm on the side of [X].
   
   **Antonyms**: I'm against [X]., I'm not in favour of [X]., I oppose [X].
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - Stating your stance in discussions about options ("I'm pro remote work.").  
   - Informal meetings, debates, conversations among colleagues or friends.  
   - Situations where clarity about being on the pro side is helpful.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - Very formal writing (prefer "I am in favour of" or "I support").  
   - When you should appear neutral (facilitator, moderator, researcher reporting results).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I'm strongly pro [X].
   - I'm cautiously pro [X].
   - I'm definitely pro [X].
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: 
   - Using `pro` sounds concise and modern but can also sound blunt in hierarchical cultures.  
   - Adding adverbs ("cautiously", "strongly") lets you calibrate how committed you sound.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting/aligning: "Same here—I'm pro [X] too."  
   - Contrasting: "I'm actually more against it." / "I'm not pro or against—I’m undecided."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm pro this change as long as we communicate it clearly.  
   - I'm pro a strongly pro-customer refund policy.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In less formal segments of the interview, participants frequently used expressions like "I'm pro this idea" to signal support.  
   - Several managers described themselves as "pro remote work" in internal surveys.

1. **Functional Expression**: Are you pro or against [NOUN / -ing]? (function: inquiring about stance)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Direct question about whether someone supports or opposes a proposal or idea.
   - *Formality*: informal/neutral  
   - *Directness*: direct, potentially face‑threatening in sensitive topics
   
   **Synonyms**: Are you for or against [X]?, Where do you stand on [X]?, Do you support [X]?
   
   **Antonyms**: (not a direct opposite; alternative is to avoid asking or to ask about concerns instead)
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - Discussions where it's acceptable to ask for a clear position.  
   - Group decisions, planning meetings, or debates about pro‑/anti‑ issues.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - Highly sensitive topics (politics, identity) with strangers; may feel too confrontational.  
   - When people need space to explore ideas without committing.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Are you pro‑[X] or more against it?  
   - Are you generally pro or against this kind of reform?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: 
   - Framing the question as pro *or* against can push people into a binary choice; some may prefer to say "it depends".  
   - Tone of voice and context strongly influence how pushy this sounds.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "I'm definitely pro [X]."  
   - "I'm more against it."  
   - "I'm somewhere in the middle to be honest."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Are you pro or against moving to a more pro‑environment supplier?  
   - Be honest—are you pro or against this pro‑market package?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Survey items asked whether respondents were "pro or against" specific pro‑democracy reforms.  
   - In interviews we avoided asking "Are you pro or against…?" directly on highly sensitive issues.

1. **Functional Expression**: There’s a strong pro-[GROUP/ISSUE] camp. (function: describing alignment)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describes a clearly identifiable group of people who are strongly pro a particular side or issue.
   - *Formality*: neutral (usable in both spoken and written analysis)  
   - *Directness*: descriptive rather than confrontational
   
   **Synonyms**: There is a strong group supporting [X]., There is a clear pro-[X] bloc., Many people are firmly in the pro-[X] camp.
   
   **Antonyms**: There’s a strong anti-[X] camp., There’s little support for [X].
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - Analysing debate dynamics ("a strong pro‑environment camp and a smaller sceptical camp").  
   - Explaining how opinions cluster in organisations or societies.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - When positions are very fluid or individual; then talk about "mixed views" rather than "camps".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - a strong pro‑[X] camp
   - a vocal pro‑[X] camp
   - the pro‑[X] camp and the anti‑[X] camp
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: 
   - "Camp" imagery turns politics into sides; helpful for clarity but can reinforce polarisation.  
   - Works well in commentary and analysis, less so in highly diplomatic communication.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Yes, and the anti‑[X] camp is getting louder too."  
   - "Actually, the pro‑[X] camp is smaller than it looks."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There's a strong pro‑remote‑work camp in our team right now.  
   - Online, there's a really vocal pro‑technology camp.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Within the legislature, there is a strong pro‑democracy camp and a smaller status‑quo camp.
   - Survey data confirm the emergence of a clear pro‑environment camp among younger voters.

1. **Functional Expression**: We position ourselves as proudly pro-[ISSUE]. (function: signalling identity/branding)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A self‑description used by organisations to communicate a clear pro stance as part of their brand or mission.
   - *Formality*: neutral/semi‑formal (branding and mission statements)  
   - *Directness*: direct, identity‑defining
   
   **Synonyms**: We present ourselves as strongly in favour of [X]., Our brand is openly pro‑[X]., We see ourselves as pro‑[X].
   
   **Antonyms**: We remain neutral on [X]., We don't take a position on [X]., We avoid identifying as pro‑ or anti‑[X].
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - About‑page copy, mission statements, speeches describing core values ("proudly pro‑science, pro‑environment").

   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - When legal or regulatory frameworks require neutrality.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - We are proudly pro‑[X].
   - We position ourselves as pro‑[X].
   - Our organisation is openly pro‑[X].
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: 
   - "Proudly" can inspire supporters but may provoke critics; use when you intend to take a clear side.  
   - Combining multiple labels ("pro‑science, pro‑innovation, pro‑customer") quickly sketches a value set.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "It's good to see a company that's openly pro‑environment."  
   - "Some investors are wary of organisations that are so explicitly pro‑[X]."

1. **Functional Expression**: I wouldn't say I'm fully pro-[X], but… (function: hedging/softening stance)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Softens or qualifies a pro stance, signalling mixed feelings or partial support.
   - *Formality*: informal/neutral  
   - *Directness*: indirect; uses hedging to reduce commitment
   
   **Synonyms**: I'm cautiously pro‑[X]., I'm leaning pro‑[X]., I'm not completely against [X].
   
   **Antonyms**: I'm fully pro‑[X]., I'm completely against [X].
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - Discussions where you want to show nuance or avoid sounding extreme.  
   - Early stages of negotiation or brainstorming.

   - I wouldn't say I'm exactly pro‑[X], but…
   - I'm not fully pro‑[X], but…

   - Works well in cultures that value modesty or dislike highly polarised statements.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "So you're cautiously pro‑[X]?"  
   - "What would make you more fully pro‑[X]?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Several interviewees commented, "I wouldn't say I'm fully pro‑integration, but…", signalling cautious support.  
   - Participants often used hedged expressions such as "I wouldn't say I'm fully pro‑technology" to manage potential disagreement.

1. **Functional Expression**: I'm more pro-[A] than [B]. (function: expressing relative preference)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates a comparative stance: you lean towards one option while not completely rejecting the other.
   - *Formality*: informal/neutral  
   - *Directness*: moderately direct but still relatively soft
   
   **Synonyms**: I tend to prefer [A] over [B]., I'm more in favour of [A] than [B]., I lean towards [A].
   
   **Antonyms**: I'm equally in favour of both., I'm more pro-[B] than [A].
   
   **When to Use**: 
   - When two pro options are on the table and you want to show a tilt rather than an absolute choice.

   - I'm slightly more pro‑[X] than [Y].
   - I'm much more pro‑[X] than [Y].
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**:

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Interesting—I'm more pro‑[B] than [A]."

   **Examples [Casual]**:
