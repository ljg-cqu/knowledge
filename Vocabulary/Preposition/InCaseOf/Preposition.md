1. **Preposition**: in case of (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Conditional/Preventive)* Used before a noun phrase to specify what should happen if a particular risk, problem, or event occurs or might occur.
   - *(Instructional/Policy)* Very common in written instructions, safety notices, contracts, and procedures to introduce required actions when a named situation happens.
   
   **Synonyms**: in the event of (formal notices), in the case of (neutral), if (before clauses, not noun phrases)
   
   **Antonyms**: regardless of, despite, in spite of, irrespective of
   
   **When to Use**: Use `in case of + noun` when giving clear guidance or rules about how to respond to specific situations, especially emergencies, failures, or exceptions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use it directly before a full clause (*"in case of it rains" ✗). Use `in case + clause` instead ("in case it rains"). Avoid stacking causal markers (e.g., *"because of in case of"*).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: in case of emergency, in case of fire, in case of earthquake, in case of system failure, in case of doubt, in case of need
   - **Verb + prep**: call [number] in case of emergency, evacuate in case of fire, shut down the system in case of overheating
   - **Adjective + prep**: prepared in case of delay, available in case of emergency, ready in case of power cuts
   - **Noun + prep**: procedures in case of fire, instructions in case of emergency, backup plan in case of outage
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (inside, within) + case (situation, instance) + of (linking noun phrase) → literally "in the situation of"
   
   **Etymology**: English → built from common words `in` + `case` + `of`. The pattern "in case of + noun" became standard in safety language, legal documents, and technical manuals to introduce contingency instructions.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In case of emergency, call this number and wait for instructions.
   - Keep a small amount of cash at home in case of power cuts or card problems.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In case of fire, occupants must use the stairwells and refrain from using elevators.
   - In case of system failure, all transactions shall be logged and recovered according to the business continuity plan.
