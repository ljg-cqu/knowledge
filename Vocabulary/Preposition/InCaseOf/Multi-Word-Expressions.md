1. **Expression**: in case of emergency (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A standard phrase used on signs, forms, and instructions to introduce what to do when a serious problem or danger occurs.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed; wording rarely changes).
   
   **Synonyms**: if there is an emergency, in an emergency, in an emergency situation

   **When to Use**: Use on labels, safety notices, ID cards, and instructions to signal emergency‑only actions (phone numbers, exits, contacts).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for minor issues—it is reserved for real emergencies. Do not follow it with a clause; use a noun phrase: "in case of emergency, dial 119" vs *"in case of emergency happens"*.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - In case of emergency, break glass.
   - In case of emergency, call [number].
   - In case of emergency, contact [name].
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - The words combine to form a globally recognized safety formula, especially in public spaces and on equipment, signalling special rules that only apply when something serious happens.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (inside) + case (situation) + of (linking) + emergency (serious danger).

   **Synonyms**: next of kin (formal/legal), emergency number, person to contact in an emergency
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (no direct opposite; conceptually "regular contact")
   
   **When to Use**: Use in forms, HR records, school documents, and apps where people must name someone to be called in case of emergency.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - list an emergency contact
   - update your emergency contact details
   - primary/secondary emergency contact
   - emergency contact information
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Emergency" specifies the special situation; "contact" names the person to reach. Together they form the standard phrase used worldwide in risk and safety documents.
   
   **Root Analysis**: emergency (serious danger) + contact (person to reach).

   **Common Variations**: 
   - mark the emergency exits
   - emergency exit route
   - emergency exit sign/lighting
   - keep emergency exits clear in case of fire
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   - test the contingency plan in case of system failure
   - legal contingency plan in case of dispute
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Contingency" (possible future problem) naturally pairs with "plan" to describe structured preparation for in‑case‑of scenarios.
   
   **Root Analysis**: contingency (possible event) + plan (organized set of actions).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need a contingency plan in case our main supplier can't deliver.
   - As a contingency plan in case of rain, we've booked an indoor venue.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We should have a backup plan in case the train is cancelled.
