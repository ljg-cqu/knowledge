1. **Linking Word**: if (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a condition; shows that one thing happens only when another thing happens.
   - *Function*: The most common way to express what should happen in case of a particular event.
   
   **Synonyms**: in case (clausal), provided that, assuming that
   
   **Antonyms**: unless, regardless of, even if (for contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Use `if + clause` to describe actions or results that apply in case of accidents, failures, or emergencies ("If there is a fire, ...").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use `if` directly before a noun when you need a preposition; use `in case of + noun` instead ("in case of fire" not *"if fire"* in safety notices).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: If [danger/event happens], [instruction/action].
   - **Position**: sentence‑initial (comma after) or mid‑sentence (no comma).
   - **Punctuation**: If‑clause first → comma; main clause first → no comma.
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Mixing `if` and `in case` incorrectly ("If fire" instead of "If there is a fire").
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple conjunction from Old English.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *gif* (if) used as standard conditional marker since the earliest records of English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If there is an emergency, call this number.
   - If anything goes wrong, just send me a message.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - If an alarm sounds, occupants must proceed directly to the nearest exit.
   - If system integrity is compromised, the incident‑response plan shall be activated.

1. **Linking Word**: in the event that (type: phrasal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal way of saying "if"; introduces a possible future situation, especially in legal, policy, or safety language.
   - *Function*: Expresses what applies in case of a named event with a high level of formality.
   
   **Synonyms**: if, should, in case, in the event of (prepositional form)
   
   **Antonyms**: regardless of, even if, despite the fact that
   
   **When to Use**: Use in contracts, policies, and formal instructions when specifying obligations or procedures in case of certain events.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for everyday conversation—"if" or "in case" is more natural there.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: In the event that [clause], [consequence/procedure].
   - **Position**: Usually sentence‑initial.
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after the introductory phrase.
   
   **Root Analysis**: event (happening) + prepositional frame "in the event that".
   
   **Etymology**: Developed in formal English to frame hypothetical situations in legal and bureaucratic texts.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Uncommon; people normally say "if".)
   - In the event that you can't come, just text me. (Sounds formal in speech.)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In the event that a system outage occurs, critical services shall fail over to the backup site.
   - In the event that evacuation is required, staff must assist visitors to the assembly points.

1. **Linking Word**: should (conditional use; type: auxiliary/subordinator)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Placed before the subject to introduce a formal conditional clause with the meaning "if it happens that".
   - *Function*: Elegant way to express what to do in case of a possible event, especially in written instructions.
   
   **Synonyms**: if, in case, in the event that
   
   **Antonyms**: unless, regardless of, even if (depending on structure)
   
   **When to Use**: Use at the beginning of a clause in formal notices and manuals ("Should a fire break out, ...") as an alternative to "If a fire breaks out, ...".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in low‑level learners' materials or very casual speech where the inversion may confuse; use plain "if" instead.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Should + subject + verb, [instruction].
   - **Position**: Sentence‑initial, comma before main clause.
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Adding "if" as well (*"Should if"* ✗), or using past tense where present is needed.
   
   **Root Analysis**: modal verb "should" used with subject‑auxiliary inversion.
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English *sceolde* (past of *shall*), later grammaticalized as modal for advice, expectation, and condition.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rare; more natural in formal contexts.)
   - Should anything happen, just call me. (Semi‑formal.)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Should an emergency arise, the duty manager must be contacted immediately.
   - Should the primary site become unavailable, services will be restored from backup.

1. **Linking Word**: otherwise (type: connector/adverb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates what will happen if the previous condition is not met; "if not" or "or else".
   - *Function*: Expresses consequences of not following instructions in case of risk.
   
   **Synonyms**: or else, if not, alternatively (in some uses)
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise (when adding similar information)
   
   **When to Use**: Use after instructions to warn what happens if people do not act correctly in case of fire, system failure, or other hazards.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal legal language where "failing which" or "otherwise" with explicit conditions may be preferred; also avoid sounding threatening in interpersonal contexts.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Follow [procedure]; otherwise, [negative consequence].
   - **Position**: Sentence‑initial in the second sentence, or mid‑sentence with commas.
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after "otherwise" when sentence‑initial.
   
   **Root Analysis**: other + wise (manner) → in a different way.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *othre wisan* (in another way) → "otherwise".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In case of fire, use the stairs; otherwise, you might get stuck in the elevator.
   - Keep your phone charged in case of emergency; otherwise, you won't be able to call for help.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Follow the documented shutdown procedure in case of malfunction; otherwise, equipment damage may occur.
   - Backups must be tested regularly; otherwise, recovery in case of failure cannot be guaranteed.

1. **Linking Word**: unless (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Except if; used to say that something will happen or be true only if another thing does not happen.
   - *Function*: States what applies except in a particular in‑case‑of scenario.
   
   **Synonyms**: except if, if not
   
   **Antonyms**: if, provided that, as long as
   
   **When to Use**: Use when expressing rules that hold in general but stop applying in case of emergency, failure, or exception ("Do not use this exit unless...").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid double negatives (*"won't survive unless doesn't get help"* ✗). Do not use when you want a simple positive condition—then use "if".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Main rule] unless [exception condition].
   - **Position**: Usually mid‑sentence; may be sentence‑initial in formal writing.
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Combining with "except" (*"except unless"* ✗) or adding extra negative verbs.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + less (on a lower condition) → "under a different condition".
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English *on lesse (than)* → "unless" with meaning "except if".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don't call this number unless it's really an emergency.
   - We won't leave the building unless there's an actual fire alarm.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Emergency exits must remain closed unless evacuation is in progress.
   - Staff are not permitted to override safety interlocks unless authorized in writing.
