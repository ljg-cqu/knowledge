1. **Adjective**: prepared (for) (gradable; attributive and predicative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Ready and properly equipped to deal with a particular situation, especially an unexpected problem or emergency.
   
   **Synonyms**: ready, equipped, organized, set, primed
   
   **Antonyms**: unprepared, caught off guard, vulnerable, exposed
   
   **When to Use**: Use when talking about people, teams, systems, or plans that can respond effectively in case of emergencies, failures, or disruptions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when nothing has actually been planned or provided—then "hopeful" or "confident" may be more accurate than "prepared".
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - be prepared in case of emergency
   - fully prepared in case of disaster
   - prepared in case of power outage
   - prepared for any contingency
   
   **Root Analysis**: pre- (before) + pare (make ready) + -ed (state/result)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *praeparare* (to make ready beforehand) → Old French → English "prepare" → "prepared" as past participle and adjective.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep some bottled water at home so you're prepared in case of an earthquake.
   - I'm always prepared in case of delays—I carry a power bank and some snacks.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization must remain prepared in case of large-scale system outages.
   - Hospitals are required to be fully prepared in case of mass-casualty incidents.

1. **Adjective**: precautionary (non-gradable; primarily attributive)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Taken in advance to prevent possible danger, harm, or problems; serving as a safeguard against potential risk.
   
   **Synonyms**: preventive, protective, safety-focused, risk-averse
   
   **Antonyms**: reckless, negligent, careless, risky
   
   **When to Use**: Use before nouns like "measures," "steps," or "checks" when describing actions taken in case of possible emergencies or failures, even if nothing has gone wrong yet.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech; "extra safety" or "just to be safe" is more natural in conversation.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - precautionary measures in case of fire
   - precautionary checks in case of equipment failure
   - precautionary evacuation in case of gas leak
   - precautionary shutdown in case of overheating
   
   **Root Analysis**: pre- (before) + caution (care) + -ary (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: From "precaution" (17th century) + "-ary" to form an adjective describing actions taken in advance for safety.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They ordered a precautionary evacuation in case of aftershocks.
   - I'm taking some precautionary steps in case of job cuts.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Precautionary measures must be implemented in case of elevated threat levels.
   - The team carried out a precautionary shutdown in case of potential data corruption.

1. **Adjective**: redundant (in safety sense; gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Of equipment or systems) Duplicated so that one can take over if another fails; providing backup capacity in case of failure.
   
   **Synonyms**: duplicated, backup, failover, standby, secondary
   
   **Antonyms**: single-point, sole, irreplaceable, non-redundant
   
   **When to Use**: Use in engineering, IT, and risk management when describing extra systems kept ready in case of outages, breakdowns, or disasters.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse with the everyday meaning "unnecessary"—in technical contexts redundant systems are deliberate and desirable.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - redundant power supply in case of grid failure
   - redundant backups in case of data loss
   - redundant network links in case of outage
   - highly redundant architecture in case of disasters
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (again) + undare (to rise, swell) → overflowing, more than enough
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *redundare* (to overflow) → "redundant" (more than necessary). In modern engineering, reinterpreted positively as deliberate duplication for safety.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We have a redundant internet line in case of problems with the main one.
   - Keep a redundant copy of your documents in case of laptop failure.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The data center relies on redundant power feeds in case of upstream supply interruptions.
   - Redundant communication channels are required in case of primary-network disruption.

1. **Adjective**: fail-safe (non-gradable; primarily attributive)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Designed so that, if something goes wrong, it will default to a safe condition rather than a dangerous one.
   
   **Synonyms**: safety-critical, self-protecting, protective, fault-tolerant
   
   **Antonyms**: fragile, unsafe, failure-prone, high-risk
   
   **When to Use**: Use for mechanisms, designs, or procedures that automatically protect people or systems in case of failure, error, or emergency.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid exaggeration—many systems are "safer" but not truly fail-safe. Reserve for designs that really default to safety.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - fail-safe switch in case of overload
   - fail-safe mechanism in case of power loss
   - fail-safe design in case of human error
   - fail-safe mode in case of software crash
   
   **Root Analysis**: fail (stop working) + safe (not causing harm) → safe even when it fails
   
   **Etymology**: 20th‑century engineering term for designs where any failure drives the system into a safe state.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The elevator has a fail-safe brake in case of cable problems.
   - Set up a fail-safe so your files sync to the cloud in case of laptop loss.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Railway signaling systems must include fail-safe mechanisms in case of component malfunction.
   - The controller enters a predefined fail-safe state in case of sensor inconsistencies.

1. **Adjective**: contingency (attributive only)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing something (often a plan, budget, or arrangement) that is reserved for possible future problems or emergencies.
   
   **Synonyms**: backup, reserve, alternative, standby, emergency (attributive)
   
   **Antonyms**: primary, main, core, standard
   
   **When to Use**: Use before nouns like "plan," "fund," or "arrangements" when talking about resources or strategies kept ready in case of unexpected events.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use on its own as predicate (*"the system is contingency" ✗). It is normally only attributive: "contingency plan," "contingency fund."
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - contingency plan in case of disruption
   - contingency fund in case of revenue shortfall
   - contingency arrangements in case of cancellation
   - contingency capacity in case of peak demand
   
   **Root Analysis**: from noun "contingency" (possible event) used attributively before another noun
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *contingere* (to happen) → "contingency" (possible event) → attributive use in "contingency plan/fund" in risk‑management language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We should have a contingency plan in case of bad weather on the wedding day.
   - Keep a small contingency fund in case of sudden expenses.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All projects must include a contingency budget in case of cost overruns.
   - The organization maintains contingency arrangements in case of large-scale service disruption.
