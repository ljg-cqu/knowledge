1. **Original Expression**: In case of emergency, call this number.  
   **Context**: Standard wording on signs, cards, and equipment telling people what to do in emergencies
   
   **Core Intent**: To give a clear, simple instruction about who to contact when an emergency happens
   
   **Casual**: If there's an emergency, just call this number.  
   *Characteristics*: Contraction ("there's"), softer "just," friendly tone, everyday vocabulary  
   *Use when*: Speaking to friends or family, informal briefings, internal chats where tone can be relaxed
   
   **Semi-Formal**: In case of emergency, please call this number.  
   *Characteristics*: Keeps the fixed safety phrase, adds "please," neutral professional tone  
   *Use when*: Workplace posters, school information sheets, company ID cards, visitor guides
   
   **Formal**: In the event of an emergency, please contact the following number without delay.  
   *Characteristics*: "In the event of" instead of "in case of," full noun phrase "an emergency," formal verb "contact"  
   *Use when*: Policies, legal documents, safety manuals, contracts, official building notices
   
   **Humorous**: If everything suddenly goes sideways, this is your "help me" number—use it!  
   *Characteristics*: Colloquial metaphor ("goes sideways"), playful quotation marks, exclamation  
   *Use when*: Light internal presentations, informal training slides, friendly team documentation  
   *Avoid when*: High‑risk industries, legal/compliance texts, situations where tone must stay strictly serious
   
   **Lively**: If something serious happens, grab your phone and call this number right away!  
   *Characteristics*: Imperatives ("grab," "call"), urgency markers ("right away"), energetic rhythm  
   *Use when*: Safety briefings, training sessions, spoken announcements, engaging instructional videos
   
   **Empathetic**: If you ever find yourself in an emergency, please call this number so we can help you.  
   *Characteristics*: Direct address ("you"), supportive purpose clause ("so we can help"), calm reassuring tone  
   *Use when*: Staff/volunteer handbooks, wellbeing communications, student/employee support materials
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: For the general public or external stakeholders, use Semi‑Formal or Formal; Casual/Humorous fits only equal‑status internal audiences.
   - *Social Distance*: The more distant/unknown the reader, the more neutral and standard the wording should be (Semi‑Formal or Formal).
   - *Gravity of Situation*: The higher the potential risk, the more appropriate Semi‑Formal/Formal variants become; avoid Humorous when lives or serious harm are involved.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect emergency wording to be very direct and serious; others allow slightly softer tones as long as the action is clear.
   - *Medium*: Printed signs and cards favour Semi‑Formal/Formal; spoken briefings and online training can safely use Lively/Empathetic versions.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using overly casual jokes on official emergency signage (undermines seriousness and clarity).
   - Mixing structures (*"in case of emergency happens"*) instead of the correct "in case of emergency" + clause.
   - Leaving the action vague ("get help" instead of clearly saying "call this number").
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Many organisations standardise emergency wording across sites and countries. In more hierarchical cultures, the Formal variant is preferred; in flatter cultures, a Semi‑Formal or Empathetic style is often chosen to feel both clear and supportive.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Printed on a company ID badge → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal ("In case of emergency, please call this number.")
   - **Situation 2**: Clause in a legal agreement about site access → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("In the event of an emergency, please contact the following number without delay.")
   - **Situation 3**: Safety talk to students on their first day → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively or Empathetic (spoken: "If something serious happens, grab your phone and call this number right away.")

1. **Original Expression**: If anything goes wrong, call me.  
   **Context**: Reassuring someone that they have support in case of problems or emergencies
   
   **Core Intent**: To promise personal help and availability in case something goes wrong
   
   **Casual**: If anything goes wrong, just call me.  
   *Characteristics*: Contraction, short clause, supportive "just," intimate tone  
   *Use when*: Friends, family, close colleagues, informal text messages and calls
   
   **Semi-Formal**: If anything goes wrong, please give me a call.  
   *Characteristics*: Polite "please," verb phrase "give me a call," neutral professional tone  
   *Use when*: Emails to colleagues, handover notes, project coordination within teams
   
   **Formal**: Should any issues arise, please do not hesitate to contact me.  
   *Characteristics*: Inversion ("Should any issues arise"), nominal "issues," polite formula "do not hesitate"  
   *Use when*: Client communication, official letters, reports, service agreements
   
   **Humorous**: If the plan explodes spectacularly, call me before you panic.  
   *Characteristics*: Exaggeration ("explodes spectacularly"), playful instruction, light tone  
   *Use when*: Relaxed team culture, internal chats, presentations where humour lowers anxiety  
   *Avoid when*: Serious emergencies, sensitive incidents, high‑stakes failures
   
   **Lively**: If anything starts to go off track, pick up the phone and reach out to me right away!  
   *Characteristics*: Dynamic verbs ("pick up," "reach out"), urgency ("right away"), upbeat tone  
   *Use when*: Motivating teams, coaching conversations, live briefings before events or launches
   
   **Empathetic**: If something feels wrong at any point, please call me so you don't have to handle it alone.  
   *Characteristics*: Focus on feelings ("feels wrong"), emotional support ("so you don't have to handle it alone"), gentle reassurance  
   *Use when*: Supporting juniors, students, vulnerable users, or anyone likely to feel overwhelmed in case of problems
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: When speaking downward (manager to staff), Empathetic or Semi‑Formal shows support; upward (staff to manager) usually needs Semi‑Formal or Formal.
   - *Social Distance*: Close relationships allow Casual/Humorous; new or formal relationships call for Semi‑Formal or Formal.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For serious risks, prefer Semi‑Formal/Empathetic; keep Humorous for low‑risk "things might go wrong" scenarios.
   - *Cultural Context*: In some cultures, promising personal help too strongly can create obligations; Formal versions soften the promise while staying supportive.
   - *Medium*: Spoken reassurance may lean Empathetic or Casual; written professional communication often uses Semi‑Formal or Formal forms.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Sounding too casual or joking when the possible emergency is truly serious.
   - Offering help that you cannot realistically provide, especially in formal agreements.
   - Using a very Formal structure with people who might interpret it as cold or distant when they need emotional support.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some workplaces, expressing overt personal support is expected; in others, it must be framed through formal roles ("contact the duty manager"). Adjust the promise based on local norms around responsibility and hierarchy.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Message to a friend travelling alone → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("If anything goes wrong, just call me.")
   - **Situation 2**: Email from project lead to client → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("Should any issues arise, please do not hesitate to contact me.")
   - **Situation 3**: Manager reassuring a new hire about on‑call support → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic ("If something feels wrong at any point, please call me so you don't have to handle it alone.")

1. **Original Expression**: In the event of a system failure, operations will be switched to the backup site.  
   **Context**: Business continuity plans describing what happens in case of major technical failure
   
   **Core Intent**: To specify the formal contingency action when systems fail
   
   **Casual**: If the system goes down, we'll move everything over to the backup site.  
   *Characteristics*: "goes down" as informal verb, "we'll move," conversational tone  
   *Use when*: Internal team discussions, stand‑ups, informal planning meetings
   
   **Semi-Formal**: If the system fails, operations will switch to the backup site.  
   *Characteristics*: Plain "if" clause, neutral verbs, clear subject ("operations"), no heavy jargon  
   *Use when*: Internal documentation, runbooks, training materials for operational staff
   
   **Formal**: In the event of a system failure, all critical operations shall be transferred to the designated backup site.  
   *Characteristics*: "In the event of," modal "shall," "critical operations," "designated backup site," highly formal register  
   *Use when*: Policies, contracts, service‑level agreements, formal continuity plans
   
   **Humorous**: If the system decides to take a nap, we seamlessly teleport everything to the backup site.  
   *Characteristics*: Personification ("takes a nap"), playful exaggeration ("teleport"), light tone  
   *Use when*: Internal tech talks, informal slides, culture‑building sessions  
   *Avoid when*: External documentation, regulated environments, audit‑facing materials
   
   **Lively**: If the main system suddenly fails, our backup site steps in and keeps everything running!  
   *Characteristics*: Dramatic adverbs ("suddenly"), personification ("steps in"), exclamation, positive reassurance  
   *Use when*: Executive briefings, high‑level overviews, non‑technical audiences who need reassurance about in‑case‑of scenarios
   
   **Empathetic**: If the system ever fails, operations will move to the backup site so teams and customers can continue with as little disruption as possible.  
   *Characteristics*: Focus on impact on people ("teams and customers"), aim ("as little disruption as possible"), calm, reassuring tone  
   *Use when*: Communicating with stakeholders, customers, or staff who worry about outages and need confidence in contingency planning
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: For regulators, auditors, and senior leadership, Formal wording is often expected; for peers and internal teams, Semi‑Formal or Lively usually works.
   - *Social Distance*: External audiences require more formal, precise wording; internal audiences can accept simpler, more human language.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Higher business risk pushes you toward Formal and Empathetic; Humorous is only suitable when explaining concepts, not documenting obligations.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some corporate cultures value very direct technical language; others prefer reassuring, people‑centred explanations of in‑case‑of procedures.
   - *Medium*: Contracts and policies → Formal; intranet FAQs and presentations → Semi‑Formal, Lively, or Empathetic.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Being vague about scope (not specifying "critical operations" vs. all operations).
   - Using overly technical jargon that non‑specialist stakeholders cannot understand.
   - Adding humour to official continuity documents, which can appear unprofessional.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Business continuity language often follows industry templates. Some regulators expect strict phrasing like "In the event of" rather than "If"; always align your chosen variant with sector and jurisdiction norms.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Clause in a business continuity policy → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("In the event of a system failure, all critical operations shall be transferred to the designated backup site.")
   - **Situation 2**: Internal engineering runbook → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal ("If the system fails, operations will switch to the backup site.")
   - **Situation 3**: Presentation to non‑technical executives about contingency planning → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively or Empathetic ("If the main system suddenly fails, our backup site steps in and keeps everything running!")
