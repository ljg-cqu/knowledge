1. **Linking Word**: as (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a subordinate clause indicating time (when, while), reason (because, since), or manner (in the way that)
   - *Function*: Creates complex sentences by showing temporal, causal, or comparative relationships
   
   **Synonyms**: while (temporal), because (causal), since (reason), like (manner - informal)
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (function-specific)
   
   **When to Use**: In complex sentences across all registers to show simultaneous action, causation, or manner of comparison
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when clarity requires more specific conjunctions; can create ambiguity if meaning (time/cause/manner) isn't clear from context
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [independent clause] + as + [dependent clause]; or As + [dependent clause], [independent clause]
   - **Position**: Can introduce sentence or connect mid-sentence
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after introductory "as" clause; typically no comma when "as" clause follows main clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing "as" with "like" in formal writing; creating ambiguity about which meaning is intended
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English eallswā (all so)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English eallswā → Middle English als → Modern "as" (evolved from "all so" meaning "in like manner")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'll call you as soon as I get home.

   **Synonyms**: as though, like (informal)
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A
   
   **When to Use**: To describe appearances, behaviors, or situations that seem a certain way (whether true or not)
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal academic writing, "as though" is often preferred; avoid when stating facts rather than appearances
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [main clause] + as if + [subordinate clause]
   - **Position**: Typically follows main clause
   - **Punctuation**: Usually no comma before "as if"

   - **Position**: Typically follows main clause
   - **Punctuation**: Usually no comma before "as though"
