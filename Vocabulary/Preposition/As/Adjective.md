1. **Adjective**: comparable (comp: more comparable, sup: most comparable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Similar in size, amount, quality, or degree; able to be compared with something else (often used with "as")
   - *Gradable adjective; can be used predicatively or attributively*
   
   **Synonyms**: similar, equivalent, analogous, parallel, alike
   
   **Antonyms**: incomparable, dissimilar, different, unlike
   
   **When to Use**: In formal and academic contexts when discussing similarities or equivalences; commonly paired with "as" in phrases like "comparable as"

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - comparable quality as
   - not as comparable as
   - roughly comparable as
   
   **Root Analysis**: compare (from Latin comparare) + -able (able to be)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin comparare (to pair, match) → Old French comparer → English "compare" + suffix "-able" (capable of being)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new phone isn't as comparable as they claimed.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - equivalent as a measure
   - regarded as equivalent
   - functionally equivalent as
   
   **Root Analysis**: equi- (equal) + val- (worth, value) + -ent (adjective suffix)
