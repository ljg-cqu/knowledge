   *Characteristics*: Informal pronouns (*we*, *the other guys*), everyday verb *doing*, simple *compared to*  
   *Use when*: Talking with close colleagues, small internal team, low‑stakes status chats

   *Characteristics*: Keeps *position vis-à-vis*, adds time marker *right now*, neutral professional tone  
   *Use when*: Internal meetings, slide decks, emails within the company

   *Characteristics*: Indirect question (*could you*), *summarize* and *key competitors* sound analytical and precise

   *Use when*: Team retros, informal offsites, breaking tension around performance  
   *Avoid when*: Discussing serious underperformance or sensitive financials
   
   **Lively**: So, where exactly do we stand vis-à-vis everyone else in this game?  
   *Characteristics*: Direct question, *exactly* adds energy, *this game* metaphor, conversational rhythm  
   *Use when*: Rallying a product team, kicking off competitive reviews, energizing discussions
   
   **Empathetic**: Can we get a clear picture of where we stand vis-à-vis competitors, so the team knows what we’re really up against?

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use the formal variant when speaking upward to executives; casual variants fit peer‑level chats.
   - *Social Distance*: New cross‑team meetings favor semi‑formal; close teams can use humorous or lively forms.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: High‑stakes board reviews require formal; routine check‑ins can use semi‑formal.
   - *Cultural Context*: Conservative or risk‑averse cultures expect semi‑formal or formal; startup cultures tolerate humor.
   - *Medium*: Slides and docs favor semi‑formal or formal; chat tools can carry casual or lively versions.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Overusing *vis-à-vis* in very casual talk—sounds pretentious or performative.
   - Asking *How are we doing vis-à-vis everyone?* without clarifying metric (revenue, share, quality?).
   - Using a humorous scale when stakeholders are under real pressure from competition.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, explicit “score‑keeping” vis-à-vis others can feel confrontational. Softer alternatives like *How do we compare right now?* may land better.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Quarterly business review with execs → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal *Could you summarize our current position vis-à-vis key competitors?*
   - **Situation 2**: Slack chat with product squad → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑formal *What’s our position vis-à-vis the competition right now?*
   - **Situation 3**: Team feeling anxious about a rival launch → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic *Can we get a clear picture… so the team knows what we’re really up against?*

   *Use when*: Internal debriefs, honest team conversations, one‑to‑one chats

   - *Gravity of Situation*: The more material the risk, the more you should lean to formal/empathetic.
   - *Medium*: Written minutes favor semi‑formal or formal; spoken briefings can carry lively or empathetic versions.

   - Using only casual *upper hand* language in official documentation.
   - Ignoring the emotional impact on staff when describing weak positions.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, openly stating weakness vis-à-vis partners is unusual. Softening with *constrained* or *limited* can be more acceptable.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal legal memo → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal *bargaining position… is constrained*.
   - **Situation 2**: Team meeting before renegotiation → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑formal or empathetic version acknowledging risk.

   - **Situation 2**: Compliance training kick‑off → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively or humorous to keep attention.
