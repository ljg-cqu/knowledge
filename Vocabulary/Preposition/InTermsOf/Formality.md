1. **Original Expression**: We measure success by how much money we make.
   **Context**: Casual conversation about business or career goals
   
   **Core Intent**: To define success using a specific metric or criterion (financial gain)
   
   **Casual**: We count success by how much cash we bring in.
   *Characteristics*: Informal vocabulary ("cash," "bring in"), contracted forms possible, simple structure
   *Use when*: Friends, close colleagues, relaxed settings, everyday conversation
   
   **Semi-Formal**: We measure success in terms of revenue generated.
   *Characteristics*: Professional vocabulary ("revenue," "generated"), balanced tone, clear structure
   *Use when*: General workplace, business meetings, professional emails, standard reports
   
   **Formal**: Success is quantified in terms of financial performance metrics.
   *Characteristics*: Technical vocabulary, passive constructions, abstract nouns ("quantified," "metrics"), impersonal tone
   *Use when*: Academic writing, formal reports, executive presentations, research papers
   
   **Humorous**: We define success by checking if our bank account laughs or cries.
   *Characteristics*: Personification, playful imagery, relatable metaphor
   *Use when*: Ice-breaking moments, casual presentations, social gatherings
   *Avoid when*: Serious business discussions, financial distress situations, formal meetings
   
   **Lively**: Success? It's all about those numbers going up, up, up!
   *Characteristics*: Exclamatory tone, repetition for emphasis, energetic punctuation
   *Use when*: Motivational contexts, team rallies, celebratory moments
   
   **Empathetic**: We tend to measure success financially, though I know that's not everything that matters.
   *Characteristics*: Hedging language ("tend to"), acknowledgment of alternative perspectives, validating tone
   *Use when*: Counseling contexts, sensitive discussions about values, acknowledging diverse perspectives
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher authority requires "quantified in terms of" (formal); peers allow "measure by" (casual)
   - *Social Distance*: Professional acquaintances require semi-formal; close friends allow casual
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Financial reporting requires formal; everyday chat allows casual
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures prefer indirect, formal expressions even in casual settings
   - *Medium*: Written reports require formal; face-to-face allows more casual
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "in terms of" excessively in casual speech sounds awkward and overly academic
   - Mixing registers: "We quantify success by cash" combines formal verb with casual noun inappropriately
   - Overusing the phrase as filler: "In terms of success, in terms of money..." becomes redundant
   
   **Cultural Notes**: English speakers, especially Americans, may overuse "in terms of" as a filler phrase. In some cultures, direct statements without the phrase are preferred. British English may favor "as regards" or "with respect to" in formal contexts.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Annual board meeting presentation → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("quantified in terms of financial performance metrics") because authority figures present, high stakes, written report format
   - **Situation 2**: Coffee chat with colleague about career → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("count success by how much cash we bring in") because equal status, relaxed setting, conversational
   - **Situation 3**: Department meeting with manager → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-formal ("measure success in terms of revenue generated") because moderate power distance, professional context, standard business discussion

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Overusing "-wise" suffix in formal writing: "Quality-wise" sounds too casual for reports
   - Mixing metaphors inappropriately: "Quality meter hits the roof" confuses measurement with height
   - Using "in terms of" when simpler alternatives exist: "Regarding quality" or "The quality is" may be clearer
   
   **Cultural Notes**: The "-wise" suffix (quality-wise, price-wise) is common in American English but less favored in British English, where "as regards" or "with respect to" are preferred in formal contexts.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: ISO quality audit report → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("demonstrates exceptional standards from a quality perspective") for regulatory compliance and documentation
