   - I'm very satisfied with [X] (intensifying)
   - I'm not entirely happy with [X] (hedging negative feedback)

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - To satisfaction: "I'm glad to hear that" / "That's great to know"
   - To dissatisfaction: "I understand your concerns" / "What can we do to improve?"

   - I partially agree with [X] (hedging, showing nuance)
   - I'm afraid I disagree with [X] (softening disagreement)
   - I see your point, but I disagree with [X] (acknowledging before disagreeing)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Agreement is positive politeness (builds rapport); disagreement is face-threatening and often requires mitigation. Cultural norms vary: some cultures value direct disagreement (showing engagement), others require indirection (preserving harmony).
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - To agreement: "I'm glad we're on the same page" / "Great minds think alike"
   - To disagreement: "I see your perspective" / "Let's explore that further" / "Fair enough"

   **Meaning**: 
   - Pragmatic function: To request help or assistance with a task, problem, or activity

   - *Directness*: indirect (modal question form reduces imposition)
   
   **Synonyms**: Would you mind helping me with, I was wondering if you could help me with, Could I trouble you to help with
   
   **Antonyms**: I don't need help with (declining help)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when requesting assistance in everyday situations, workplace contexts, or when you need support. The indirectness shows respect for the other person's autonomy and time.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in emergencies where direct imperatives are needed ("Help me!"). Don't use when formal requests require more elaborate structures.
   
   **Common Variations**:

   - I need help with [X] (more direct, less polite)
   - Would you be able to help me with [X]? (more formal, checking ability/availability)

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Sure, I'd be happy to" / "Of course" / "No problem"
   - Declining: "I'm sorry, I can't right now" / "I wish I could, but..." / "Maybe ask [someone else]?"

   - Is something wrong with [X]? (yes/no question, softer)
   - What seems to be wrong with [X]? (more formal, professional troubleshooting)

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Describing problem: "It's not working properly" / "There's a malfunction" / "The [component] is broken"
