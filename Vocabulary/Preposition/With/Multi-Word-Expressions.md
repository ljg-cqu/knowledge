1. **Expression**: deal with (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To handle, manage, or take action concerning a problem, situation, or person; to address difficulties or responsibilities
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very commonly paired; "deal" rarely used without preposition in this sense)
   
   **Synonyms**: handle, manage, address, tackle, cope with, take care of
   
   **Antonyms**: avoid, ignore, neglect, evade
   
   **When to Use**: Use for problem-solving, managing responsibilities, handling difficult situations, or conducting business. Universal across registers from casual to formal.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when more specific verbs are available ("solve" for math problems, "treat" for medical issues). Don't use as euphemism when direct language is needed ("reject" not "deal with rejection").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - have to deal with
   - learn to deal with
   - deal effectively with
   - deal directly with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Deal" evolved from "divide/distribute" to "handle/manage." The preposition "with" naturally followed to indicate the object being handled. This pairing became conventionalized in business and problem-solving contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "dǣlan" (divide, distribute) + "with" (instrumental/accompaniment preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I can't deal with this drama right now.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - strictly in accordance with
   - fully in accordance with
   - in accordance with regulations
   - in accordance with established procedures
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Accordance" (harmony, agreement) naturally pairs with "with" to indicate what one is in harmony with. This fixed phrase became standard in legal and formal English for expressing compliance.
   
   **Root Analysis**: ac- (to) + cord (heart, agreement) + -ance (noun suffix) + with
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just follow what the manual says.
   - Do it the way they told you to.

   - come up with an idea
   - come up with a solution
   - come up with a plan
   - manage to come up with
   - couldn't come up with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Originally metaphorical: ideas "come up" (emerge) "with" (accompanying) the thinker. The spatial metaphor of ideas rising became conventionalized into today's idiom meaning "produce/devise."
   
   **Root Analysis**: come (Old English "cuman" = arrive, move) + up (direction) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you come up with a better excuse than that?

   - in line with expectations
   - in line with company policy
   - in line with industry standards
   - broadly in line with
   - directly in line with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Line" metaphorically represents alignment or arrangement. "In line with" extends this spatial metaphor to mean "aligned/consistent with," becoming standard business and formal English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (position) + line (row, alignment) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That matches what we discussed before.

   - won't put up with
   - have to put up with
   - refuse to put up with
   - tired of putting up with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Etymology uncertain, but likely from nautical/lodging origins ("put up" = house/lodge + "with" = alongside). Metaphorical extension to "tolerate the presence of" became conventionalized.
   
   **Root Analysis**: put (place) + up (direction) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm not putting up with this nonsense anymore.

   - keep up with demand
   - struggle to keep up with
   - hard to keep up with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Keep up" (maintain position/level) + "with" (alongside) creates transparent meaning of maintaining pace alongside someone/something. Strong collocation through frequent co-occurrence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: keep (maintain, hold) + up (maintained level) + with (alongside)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I can't keep up with all these new apps.
