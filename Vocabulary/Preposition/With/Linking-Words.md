1. **Linking Word**: with (type: subordinating connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Functions as a preposition that introduces phrases showing accompaniment, instrument, manner, or circumstances; connects noun phrases to clauses showing relationships
   - *Function*: Creates adverbial relationships showing how, with what, or under what circumstances an action occurs
   
   **Synonyms**: using (for instrument), alongside (for accompaniment), by means of (for instrument), having (for possession)
   
   **Antonyms**: without, lacking, absent
   
   **When to Use**: Use to add information about instruments, accompaniment, manner, or circumstances to main clauses. Essential for expressing relationships between actions and their contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing "with" in a single sentence (creates awkward "with" chains). Don't use when active verb constructions would be clearer ("The report with data" → "The report contains data").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Noun phrase] + with + [noun phrase]: "The teacher with experience" (possession/characteristic)
   - [Main clause] + with + [noun phrase]: "She completed the task with efficiency" (manner)
   - [Verb] + with + [noun phrase]: "Cut with scissors" (instrument)
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence or end-sentence, rarely sentence-initial
   - **Punctuation**: No comma when phrase is essential; comma when phrase is non-essential additional information
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Dangling "with" phrases (ensure clear connection to main clause), "with" phrase overload
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "wiþ" (against, toward, by)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "wiþ" → Middle English "with" → Modern English (meanings expanded from "against" to include accompaniment, instrument, manner)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I made dinner with the leftovers in the fridge.
   - The guy with the blue jacket is my brother.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Researchers approached the problem with systematic rigor and methodological precision.
   - Organizations with robust compliance frameworks demonstrate superior risk management.

1. **Linking Word**: along with (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Functions as a phrasal preposition that introduces additional elements; adds information while maintaining focus on the main subject
   - *Function*: Creates additive relationships, similar to "and" but subordinating the added information
   
   **Synonyms**: together with, in addition to, as well as, besides, alongside
   
   **Antonyms**: without, excluding, apart from
   
   **When to Use**: Use to add supplementary information while keeping grammatical focus on the main subject. Common when listing additional items or people without changing verb agreement.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when simple "and" would be clearer and more concise. Be careful with verb agreement—"along with" doesn't change singular to plural ("John, along with his friends, IS here" not "are").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Main subject] + along with + [additional elements] + [verb agreeing with main subject]
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence, after main subject
   - **Punctuation**: Typically set off with commas when mid-sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Verb agreement errors (verb must agree with main subject, not added elements), confusing with coordinating conjunction "and"
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + long (beside) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "andlang" (alongside) → "along" + "with" → phrasal preposition for addition
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My sister, along with her friends, is coming to the party.
   - The package, along with instructions, should arrive tomorrow.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Linking Word**: together with (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Functions as a phrasal preposition that emphasizes combination or joint consideration; links elements that should be considered collectively
   - *Function*: Creates relationships of combination, joint action, or collective consideration
   
   **Synonyms**: along with, combined with, in conjunction with, coupled with, plus
   
   **Antonyms**: separately from, apart from, independently of
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing to emphasize combination or collective consideration. Common in academic writing when discussing multiple factors or combined effects.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "and" or "with" is simpler. Watch verb agreement—like "along with," this doesn't make singular subjects plural.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Main element] + together with + [additional element] + [verb]
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence or sentence-initial for emphasis
   - **Punctuation**: Often set off with commas, especially mid-sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Verb agreement errors, redundancy with verbs implying combination ("combine together with" is redundant)
   
   **Root Analysis**: to- (toward) + gather (assemble) + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "togædere" (in a group) → "together" + "with" → formal phrasal preposition
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The main course together with dessert costs fifty dollars.

   **Synonyms**: combined with, together with, along with, in addition to, added to
   
   **Antonyms**: separated from, apart from, independent of
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or academic writing when discussing multiple contributing factors or combined influences. Particularly common when explaining causes or outcomes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where simpler connectors suffice. Don't use when factors are independent rather than working together.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Factor 1] + coupled with + [Factor 2] + [result/outcome]
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence, connecting contributing factors
   - **Punctuation**: Usually preceded by comma, sometimes followed by comma if phrase is long
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using when factors don't actually combine or interact, verb agreement issues
   
   **Root Analysis**: couple (Latin "copula" = bond, tie) + -ed + with (accompaniment)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "copula" (link, bond) → Old French "cople" → English "couple" (join, combine) → "coupled with" (combined with)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The bad weather, combined with traffic, made us really late.

   **When to Use**: Use in formal, legal, or regulatory contexts when indicating adherence to rules, standards, or procedures. Essential in compliance and legal writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts. Don't overuse—can make writing excessively formal or bureaucratic.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Action/procedure] + in accordance with + [rules/standards/guidelines]
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence or end-sentence, occasionally sentence-initial
   - **Punctuation**: May be set off with commas for clarity, especially if phrase is long
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using in contexts not requiring formal compliance language
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + ac- (to) + cord (heart, agreement) + -ance + with
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "cor" (heart) → "accord" (agreement) → "accordance" (harmony) → formal phrase "in accordance with"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use in academic, analytical, or professional writing when discussing alignment between data, theories, findings, or principles. Critical for logical argumentation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "matches" or "agrees with" is clearer. Don't use when claiming identity rather than compatibility.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Finding/result] + is/are + consistent with + [theory/expectation/previous findings]
   - **Position**: Predicate position after "be" verb, or as reduced relative clause
   - **Punctuation**: Standard sentence punctuation; no special requirements
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing consistency (compatibility) with causation, claiming consistency when contradictions exist
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + sist (stand) + -ent + with
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "consistere" (to stand firm together) → "consistent" (compatible, non-contradictory) + "with"

   - **Position**: Mid-sentence, connecting coordinated elements
   - **Punctuation**: Often preceded by comma; may be set off with commas if creating parenthetical information
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using for unrelated or non-coordinated actions, excessive formality in inappropriate contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + con- (together) + junct (join) + -ion + with
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "conjungere" (to join together) → "conjunction" (joining) → formal phrase "in conjunction with"
