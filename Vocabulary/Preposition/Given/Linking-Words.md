1. **Linking Word**: given (type: subordinating connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a fact, situation, or condition that must be taken into account when making a judgment or decision; functions as a subordinating connector establishing a premise-conclusion relationship
   - *Function*: Creates a causal/conditional logical relationship; signals that what follows is a consideration or constraint that affects the main clause
   
   **Synonyms**: considering, taking into account, in view of, bearing in mind, in light of
   
   **Antonyms**: disregarding, ignoring, despite, regardless of, notwithstanding
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing, academic discourse, analytical contexts, and logical argumentation when establishing premises or conditions; appropriate when presenting facts that constrain or influence conclusions; common in research papers, formal essays, business analysis, and technical writing; effective for building logical arguments
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation; avoid overuse which can make writing stilted; not appropriate for hypothetical conditions (use "if" instead); don't use when the condition is being disputed rather than accepted; learners often misplace it or confuse it with "giving"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Given [noun phrase], [independent clause] OR [Independent clause], given [noun phrase]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial (most common) / mid-sentence / sentence-final (rare)
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after "given [noun phrase]" at sentence start; comma before when mid-sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing with "giving" (present participle); omitting necessary comma; using with purely hypothetical conditions; incorrect word order
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (base verb) + -en (past participle) → evolved to connector function
   
   **Etymology**: Latin donare (to give) → Old English giefan → Middle English given → Modern English connector usage emerged from past participle meaning "granted as true" (17th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Given the weather, we should probably cancel the picnic.
   - I think it's a fair price, given what we're getting.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Given the statistical significance of the results, we reject the null hypothesis.
   - The intervention demonstrates remarkable efficacy, given the constraints of the study design.

1. **Linking Word**: given that (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a clause stating a fact or condition that serves as the basis for the conclusion or statement in the main clause
   - *Function*: Subordinating conjunction creating premise-conclusion relationship; more explicit than "given" alone; emphasizes causality
   
   **Synonyms**: considering that, seeing that, since, because, in view of the fact that
   
   **Antonyms**: although, despite the fact that, even though, regardless of the fact that
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal writing when the premise is a complete clause rather than a noun phrase; appropriate in academic writing, business reports, analytical essays; effective when making arguments based on established facts; common in scientific and technical discourse; works well when building complex logical chains
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly formal or bureaucratic in everyday conversation; avoid when a simpler connector like "since" or "because" would suffice; not appropriate when the premise is contested or uncertain; overuse can make writing repetitive
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: Given that [subject + verb], [independent clause] OR [Independent clause], given that [subject + verb]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial (most common) / mid-sentence (less common)
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after entire "given that" clause at sentence start; comma before when mid-sentence
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using "given" without "that" before a clause; omitting comma; confusing with "given" + noun phrase; incorrect tense agreement
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (verb) + -en (past participle) + that (conjunction) = compound subordinating conjunction
   
   **Etymology**: Developed as extension of "given" (premise marker) + "that" (clause introducer) → formal written English (18th-19th century) → standard in academic and professional discourse
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Given that you're already here, you might as well stay for dinner.
   - I'm not surprised she got the job, given that she has all the qualifications.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Given that previous research has yielded contradictory findings, further investigation is warranted.
   - The policy appears economically sound, given that market conditions remain stable.

1. **Linking Word**: that given (type: demonstrative + discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to refer back to a previously stated fact or condition that serves as the basis for current reasoning
   - *Function*: Cohesive device creating reference chain; "that" points to previous information while "given" marks it as an accepted premise
   
   **Synonyms**: that fact, that condition, that circumstance, that assumption, that premise
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (referential function has no direct opposites)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in extended arguments or analysis when referring back to a previously established fact or condition; appropriate in academic writing, formal analysis, and complex argumentation; helps maintain coherence in multi-paragraph reasoning; effective for building on prior points without repetition
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be unclear if the reference is ambiguous; avoid when "that fact" or simpler reference would be clearer; inappropriate in casual conversation; don't use when the premise hasn't been clearly established earlier; may confuse readers if too far from referent
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Previous statement]. That given, [independent clause] / With that given, [independent clause]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial after establishing premise in prior sentences
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after "that given" at sentence start
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Unclear reference (what does "that" point to?); using without prior establishment of premise; omitting comma
   
   **Root Analysis**: that (demonstrative pronoun) + give (verb) + -en (past participle) = referential discourse marker
   
   **Etymology**: Combination of demonstrative "that" + "given" (premise) → emerged in formal academic writing (19th-20th century) → used for coherence in extended reasoning
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We know the car needs new brakes. That given, I don't think we should take it on a long trip.
   - She's allergic to cats—that given, getting a kitten probably isn't a great idea.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The experimental design contains several methodological limitations. That given, the findings should be interpreted with appropriate caution.
   - Market volatility has increased substantially in recent quarters. With that given, investors may wish to reassess their risk tolerance.
