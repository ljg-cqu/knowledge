   **Root Analysis**: give (Old English giefan, meaning "to bestow") + -en (past participle suffix) → nominalized to mean "that which is given/granted"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English giefan (to grant, bestow) → Middle English given (past participle) → Modern English noun use emerged from mathematical/logical discourse (18th century) where "givens" meant starting conditions → generalized to mean "accepted facts" (19th-20th century)
