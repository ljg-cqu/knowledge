1. **Adverb**: (not applicable - "given" does not function as an adverb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Note: "Given" does not have a true adverbial form in standard English. However, it can function as a sentence adverb or discourse marker when positioned at the beginning of sentences to indicate conditional reasoning.
   - *Function*: When used sentence-initially (e.g., "Given the circumstances, we proceeded cautiously"), it modifies the entire sentence by establishing a premise-conclusion relationship, functioning similarly to sentence adverbs like "fortunately" or "clearly"
   
   **Synonyms**: considering (sentence adverb), bearing in mind (discourse marker), taking into account (discourse marker)
   
   **Antonyms**: disregarding, ignoring (as discourse markers)
   
   **When to Use**: "Given" functions as a preposition or discourse marker rather than a traditional adverb; use at sentence beginning to introduce conditions or considerations that affect the main clause; appropriate in formal and analytical writing when establishing premises
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not attempt to use "given" as a manner adverb (e.g., *"he spoke given" is incorrect); do not use "givenly" (non-standard); avoid using "given" to modify verbs directly as traditional adverbs do
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - Given [noun phrase], [sentence]
   - Given that [clause], [sentence]
   - [Sentence], given [noun phrase]
   - (Note: these are prepositional/discourse marker uses, not true adverbial uses)
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (base verb) + -en (past participle) → no standard adverbial derivation exists
   
   **Etymology**: Old English giefan → Middle English given → Modern English "given" remained as past participle and developed prepositional/discourse marker functions but never developed true adverbial form; English does not form adverb from "given" using typical -ly suffix
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - *Not applicable - no true adverbial usage exists in standard English*
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - *Not applicable - "given" functions as preposition/discourse marker, not adverb*

**Note on Usage**: While "given" can appear in positions typical of sentence adverbs (beginning of sentence, separated by comma), it is more accurately classified as a preposition or discourse marker introducing a noun phrase or clause. For expressing similar meanings in adverbial form, use phrases like:
- "accordingly" (in a manner consistent with the given conditions)
- "consequently" (as a result of the given circumstances)  
- "conditionally" (in a conditional manner)

These are true adverbs that can express meanings related to conditional reasoning, which "given" conveys through prepositional or discourse marker functions rather than adverbial form.
