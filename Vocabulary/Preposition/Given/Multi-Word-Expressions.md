1. **Expression**: take (something) as given (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To accept something as true, established, or self-evident without questioning or verification; to assume something without proof
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed collocation with "take...as given")
   
   **Synonyms**: take for granted, assume, presume, accept as true, regard as self-evident
   
   **Antonyms**: question, challenge, verify, investigate, doubt
   
   **When to Use**: Appropriate in academic writing, analytical contexts, logical reasoning, and philosophical discussions when discussing assumptions or premises; use when establishing what facts are accepted without proof; common in mathematics, logic, and formal argumentation; effective in critical thinking discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when assumptions should be questioned; inappropriate when encouraging critical thinking; don't use for contested or controversial claims; can suggest intellectual complacency if overused; learners may confuse with "take for granted"
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - take it as given that...
   - be taken as given
   - can be taken as given
   - should not be taken as given
   - taking as given
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Take" (accept) + "as" (in the role of) + "given" (premise/fact) creates strong semantic unit from mathematical/logical discourse; "given" evolved from past participle to noun meaning "accepted fact"; high frequency of co-occurrence in academic and formal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: take (Old English tacan) + as (Old English alswa) + give (Old English giefan) + -en (past participle)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don't just take it as given that they'll help us; we should ask first.
   - I took as given that you knew how to get there, sorry!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: given name (type: compound noun/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A person's first name, as distinguished from their surname or family name; the personal name given at birth or baptism
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed compound noun)
   
   **Synonyms**: first name, forename, Christian name, personal name, baptismal name
   
   **Antonyms**: surname, family name, last name, patronymic
   
   **When to Use**: Formal documents, official forms, administrative contexts, legal papers, international settings where naming conventions vary; appropriate in professional and bureaucratic communication; common in government, immigration, and identification contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for everyday conversation where "first name" is more natural; "Christian name" variant is culturally specific and potentially inappropriate in multicultural contexts; can sound impersonal or bureaucratic in friendly settings
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - legal given name
   - full given name
   - given and family name
   - given name and surname
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Historical practice of "giving" a name to a child at birth/baptism → "given name" emerged as compound to distinguish from inherited surnames; became standard administrative terminology; fixed expression in official discourse
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (Old English giefan) + -en (past participle) + name (Old English nama)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just put your given name here, not a nickname.
   - Her given name is Margaret, but she goes by Maggie.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Please enter your given name exactly as it appears on your identification document.
   - The application requires both given name and surname in separate fields.

1. **Expression**: given the circumstances (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Taking into account the particular conditions or situation; considering what has happened or exists
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly frequent fixed phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: considering the situation, under the circumstances, in light of the situation, all things considered
   
   **Antonyms**: regardless of circumstances, without regard to the situation, irrespective of conditions
   
   **When to Use**: Both formal and informal contexts when making judgments based on contextual factors; appropriate when explaining decisions, evaluating outcomes, or justifying actions based on situational constraints; common in explanations, excuses, and rational assessments
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound like making excuses if overused; avoid when circumstances shouldn't matter or when suggesting moral relativism; don't use to justify clearly wrong actions; may weaken arguments if used excessively
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - given the situation
   - given current circumstances
   - given these circumstances
   - given all the circumstances
   - under the given circumstances
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Given" (considering) + "the circumstances" (specific conditions) forms natural semantic unit for conditional reasoning; extremely high frequency in both spoken and written English; standardized phrase for contextual evaluation
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (verb) + -en (past participle) + the (definite article) + circumstance (Latin circumstantia "surrounding conditions") + -s (plural)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I think she handled it pretty well, given the circumstances.
   - Given the circumstances, I'm just glad everyone is okay.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee's decision was entirely reasonable given the circumstances prevailing at the time.

1. **Expression**: at any given moment/time (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At any particular point in time that might be selected; at whatever specific time you choose to consider
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed collocation with "at any given" + time noun)
   
   **Synonyms**: at any particular time, at any point, at any specific moment, at any time
   
   **Antonyms**: at no time, never, at all times, constantly
   
   **When to Use**: Appropriate in formal and informal contexts when discussing possibilities, variations over time, or instantaneous states; use when emphasizing that something can happen or be true at unspecified times; common in descriptions of dynamic systems, variable conditions, or probabilistic situations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be wordy; simpler "anytime" may suffice in casual contexts; avoid when discussing continuous rather than point-in-time phenomena; may sound overly formal in relaxed conversation
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - at any given moment
   - at any given time
   - at any given point
   - on any given day
   - at any given instant
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "At" (temporal preposition) + "any" (unspecified) + "given" (particular) + time noun creates emphasis on specificity without specifying which time; common in temporal reasoning and probabilistic statements; "given" adds specificity that "any" alone lacks
   
   **Root Analysis**: at (preposition) + any (Old English ænig) + give (Old English giefan) + -en + moment/time
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - At any given moment, there are probably fifty people in that coffee shop.
   - You never know what she'll say at any given time.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: given to understand (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To be led to believe or informed; to receive an impression or understanding, often indirectly or implicitly
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed passive construction)
   
   **Synonyms**: led to believe, informed, made to understand, told to expect, caused to think
   
   **Antonyms**: kept in ignorance, misled, deceived, uninformed about
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and semi-formal contexts when describing how information was conveyed, often with implication that the information may have been indirect, misleading, or incomplete; appropriate when reporting expectations that were created; common in legal, business, and formal narrative contexts; useful when distancing from direct claims
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation; can sound evasive or legalistic; avoid when direct statement "I was told" would be clearer; may suggest passive acceptance of information; can obscure responsibility for communication
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - be given to understand that...
   - was given to understand
   - had been given to understand
   - were given to understand
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Passive construction "be given" + infinitive "to understand" creates formal expression for information transfer; implies causative relationship (someone caused understanding); originated in formal/legal English; maintains subtle distance from direct claims
   
   **Root Analysis**: be (auxiliary) + give (Old English giefan) + -en (past participle) + to (infinitive marker) + understand (Old English understandan)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was given to understand that the meeting was optional, but apparently it wasn't.
   - We were given to understand there would be food, so we didn't eat lunch.

1. **Expression**: it's a given (that) (type: idiomatic expression)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Something is accepted as an established fact; something is so obvious or certain that it doesn't need to be stated or proven
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiomatic structure with "it's a given")
   
   **Synonyms**: it's obvious, it's certain, it's understood, it goes without saying, it's taken for granted
   
   **Antonyms**: it's uncertain, it's questionable, it's debatable, it's up in the air
   
   **When to Use**: Both casual and semi-formal contexts when asserting that something is universally accepted or so obvious it needn't be argued; appropriate when establishing common ground or shared assumptions; common in discussions, negotiations, and informal reasoning; effective for emphasizing certainty
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound presumptuous if the "given" isn't actually shared by all parties; avoid when the claim is actually controversial; inappropriate in formal academic writing where explicit argumentation is preferred; may shut down discussion prematurely
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - it's a given that...
   - that's a given
   - it's just a given
   - it should be a given
   - take it as a given
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "It" (anticipatory subject) + "be" + "a given" (noun use meaning "fact") evolved from mathematical language where "givens" are starting conditions → idiomatic expression for stating obvious facts or shared assumptions; "given" nominalized from past participle to mean "accepted fact"
   
   **Root Analysis**: it (pronoun) + be (verb) + a (article) + give (verb) + -en (past participle nominalized to noun)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's a given that she'll be late; she always is.
   - That he's brilliant is a given—the question is whether he can work with others.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
