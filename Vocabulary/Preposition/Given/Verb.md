1. **Verb**: give (past participle: given)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To transfer possession of something to someone; to hand over or present something to another person (transitive)
   - *(Sense 2)* To provide, supply, or offer something such as information, help, or attention (transitive)
   - *(Sense 3)* To perform or execute an action, such as giving a speech or giving advice (transitive)
   - *(Sense 4)* To yield, collapse, or break under pressure (intransitive)
   
   **Synonyms**: provide, offer, present, hand over, donate, bestow, grant, confer
   
   **Antonyms**: take, receive, withhold, keep, deny, refuse
   
   **When to Use**: Extremely versatile verb appropriate in all registers from casual to formal; use for physical transfer of objects, abstract transfer of information or qualities, performance of actions, or yielding under pressure; one of the most fundamental verbs in English used across all contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Given" as past participle should not be confused with "giving" (present participle); avoid overuse of "give" in formal writing where more specific verbs (provide, offer, present) might be more precise; be careful with phrasal verbs (give up, give in) which have distinct meanings
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - give someone something
   - give a speech/presentation
   - give advice/help/support
   - be given to (be prone to)
   - given the circumstances (considering)
   - take it as given (assume it's true)
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (base form from Old English giefan, no complex morphology in base form)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English giefan (to bestow, grant, deliver) → Middle English given → Modern English "give" with past participle "given" maintaining the -en suffix pattern
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you give me a hand with these boxes?
   - She gave me some great advice about the interview.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The foundation has given substantial support to educational initiatives.
   - Permission was given to proceed with the construction project.

1. **Verb**: be given (passive construction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To receive something from someone; to have something transferred, provided, or assigned to you (passive voice, transitive)
   - *(Sense 2)* To be assigned or allocated something such as a task, responsibility, or opportunity
   - *(Sense 3)* To be told, informed, or presented with information
   
   **Synonyms**: receive, be provided with, be granted, be assigned, be allocated
   
   **Antonyms**: give, provide, deny, withhold, take away
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasizing the recipient's perspective rather than the giver's action; common in formal contexts, academic writing, and professional settings; appropriate when the giver is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from context; frequently used in instructions, policies, and formal descriptions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound passive or impersonal in contexts requiring active voice; overuse weakens writing in many contexts; avoid when the agent (giver) is important to the meaning; less natural in casual conversation compared to active voice
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - be given a chance/opportunity
   - be given permission
   - be given a task/assignment
   - be given the impression
   - be given to understand
   - be given access to
   
   **Root Analysis**: be (auxiliary verb) + give (base) + -en (past participle marker) = passive construction
   
   **Etymology**: Passive construction developed alongside the verb "give" → "be given" became standard passive form in Middle English → widely used in formal and written English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was given this old guitar by my uncle when I was a kid.
   - Were you given a receipt when you paid?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Students are given three hours to complete the examination.

1. **Verb**: take as given
   **Meaning**: 
   - To accept something as true or established without question or proof; to assume something without verification (transitive phrasal)
   - To treat something as an established fact or as self-evident
   
   **Synonyms**: assume, presume, take for granted, accept as true, regard as self-evident
   
   **Antonyms**: question, challenge, doubt, verify, investigate
   
   **When to Use**: Use in academic, analytical, or logical contexts when discussing assumptions, premises, or starting points; appropriate when establishing the foundation for argument or analysis; common in mathematics, philosophy, and formal reasoning; use when discussing what facts or conditions are accepted without proof
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when assumptions should be questioned or verified; inappropriate in contexts requiring critical thinking or skepticism; don't use when the assumption is controversial or contested; can suggest intellectual laziness if overused
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - take it as given that
   - can be taken as given
   - should not be taken as given
   - take as given the assumption
   - we take as given
   
   **Root Analysis**: take (Old English tacan) + as (preposition) + give (Old English giefan) + -en (past participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Idiomatic expression developed from mathematical and logical discourse (17th-18th century) where certain premises are "given" (granted as true) → expanded to general usage meaning "assume as true"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I just took it as given that you'd be coming to the party.
