   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts requiring descriptive detail rather than reference to pre-established facts; inappropriate when the information is new rather than previously mentioned; can sound overly formal in casual conversation; learners often overuse it where "this" or "that" would be more natural

   - at a given time
   - under given circumstances
   - a given fact
   - in a given situation

   - on any given occasion
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (base verb from Old English giefan) + -en (past participle suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English giefan (to bestow, grant) → Middle English given → Modern English adjective use emerged from past participle, meaning "granted as true" or "specified" (16th century)

   - The name given to a person at birth or baptism, typically chosen by parents
   
   **Synonyms**: first name, forename, Christian name, personal name, baptismal name
   
   **Antonyms**: surname, family name, last name
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal documents, official forms, legal contexts, and academic or professional settings where distinguishing between first and last names is important; common in international contexts where naming conventions differ; appropriate in administrative and bureaucratic language
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for everyday conversation where "first name" is more natural; may sound bureaucratic or impersonal in friendly contexts; "Christian name" is culturally specific and potentially inappropriate in multicultural settings
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - given name and surname
   - enter your given name
   - legal given name
   - given name order
   - by their given name
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (verb) + -en (past participle) + name (noun) = compound adjective + noun phrase
   
   **Etymology**: From the practice of "giving" a name to a child at birth or baptism → "given name" emerged in English (15th century) to distinguish from inherited family names
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just use your given name on the form, not a nickname.
   - Her given name is Elizabeth, but everyone calls her Beth.

   **When NOT to Use**: May be inappropriate in secular or scientific contexts where religious references are unwelcome; can sound presumptuous when claiming personal entitlements; avoid in contexts discussing learned skills or earned achievements; may offend in multicultural or interfaith settings if used too casually
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - God-given talent
   - God-given right
   - God-given ability
