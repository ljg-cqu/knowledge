1. **Adverb**: nearly (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Almost; not quite; very close to being or doing something
   - To a great extent; almost completely
   - Used to indicate approximation or near completion
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, practically, virtually, approximately, just about
   
   **Antonyms**: completely, entirely, fully, totally, exactly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "nearly" to indicate close approximation but not complete achievement; when something is almost but not quite finished or true; in all registers; typically in mid-position before main verbs or adjectives
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid with negative verbs in British English (use "hardly" instead of "not nearly"); don't use for exact measurements; not suitable when precision is required
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - nearly finished, nearly complete, nearly impossible
   - nearly there, nearly done, nearly perfect
   - not nearly enough, very nearly, nearly always
   
   **Root Analysis**: near + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēar" + "-ly" → Middle English "nerly" → Modern English "nearly" - indicating approximation or close approach
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're nearly there—just five more minutes!
   - I nearly died laughing at that joke.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The project is nearly complete, with only final documentation remaining.

2. **Adverb**: close (type: manner/degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At a short distance; near in space or time
   - In a way that leaves little space or gap; tightly

   **Synonyms**: near, nearby, closely, tightly, almost
   
   **Antonyms**: far, distantly, loosely, remotely
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close" as adverb after verbs of position or movement; when describing tight spacing or proximity; with "to" for approximation; in both formal and informal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with "closely" (manner adverb for careful attention); avoid when "near" would be clearer; not standard in very formal academic writing without "to"
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - come close, get close, stand close
   - close behind, close by, close together
   - close to (+ number/state), stay close, hold close
   
   **Root Analysis**: clos- (shut, near) + -e (can function as adverb without -ly)
   
   **Etymology**: Old French "clos" → Middle English "close" → developed adverbial function meaning "near" or "tightly"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Come close so I can whisper this to you.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - live nearby, park nearby, located nearby
   - standing nearby, waiting nearby, stay nearby
   - somewhere nearby, right nearby, just nearby
   
   **Root Analysis**: near + by → "in the near vicinity"

   - work closely, follow closely, monitor closely
   - closely related, closely connected, closely associated
   
   **Root Analysis**: close + -ly (adverb suffix for manner)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - practically impossible, practically certain, practically finished
   - practically speaking, practically identical, practically everyone
   - practically worthless, practically perfect, practically guaranteed
   
   **Root Analysis**: practical (practice + -ical) + -ly
