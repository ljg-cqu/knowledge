1. **Linking Word**: as...approaches/nears (type: subordinating conjunction phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - While something is coming closer in time; during the period when something is getting near
   - *Function*: Temporal connector showing time relationship and simultaneous actions
   
   **Synonyms**: when...approaches, while...nears, as...gets closer, as...draws near
   
   **Antonyms**: as...recedes, as...moves away, while...departs
   
   **When to Use**: Use "as...approaches/nears" to connect two clauses where one action happens during the approach of a time or event; common in formal and narrative contexts; emphasizes temporal progression
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be wordy in some contexts (simpler "when" may suffice); avoid when static time reference is meant; not suitable for spatial relationships without modification
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: As [event/time] approaches/nears, [independent clause]
   - [Position]: typically sentence-initial with comma after dependent clause
   - [Punctuation]: comma required when dependent clause comes first
   - [Common errors to avoid]: mixing tenses incorrectly, using with past completed events
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (temporal conjunction) + [subject] + approaches/nears (verb)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "ælswā" (as) + approach/near (verbs indicating coming closer) → temporal conjunction pattern
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As the deadline approaches, I always get more stressed.
   - As winter nears, the days get shorter and shorter.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

2. **Linking Word**: near/close to (type: preposition functioning as connector)

   - *Function*: Shows proximity to achieving or reaching something; creates causal or conditional relationship
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, nearly, approaching, on the verge of, about to
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, distant from, nowhere near
   
   **When to Use**: Use "near/close to" before gerunds or nouns to indicate proximity to achieving or experiencing something; in both formal and informal contexts; emphasizes imminent state
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Ambiguous with spatial meaning; avoid when simple "almost" would be clearer; not suitable as pure sentence connector
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject + verb] near/close to [gerund/noun]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence after main verb
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing with spatial proximity, using with incompatible verbs
   
   **Root Analysis**: near/close (indicating proximity) + to (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēar"/"close" + "to" → prepositional phrase indicating approach to a state
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was close to tears when I heard the news.
   - We're near to finishing this whole project.

   **Synonyms**: nearing, coming to, close to, getting near to
   
   **Antonyms**: leaving, departing from, moving away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "approaching" before times, ages, numbers, or deadlines to indicate movement toward; in formal and neutral contexts; emphasizes progressive nature
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Less suitable for completed actions; avoid when exact time/number is known; can sound formal in casual speech
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] [verb], approaching [time/number/state]
   - [Position]: typically after main clause, can be sentence-initial with participle construction
   - [Punctuation]: comma when used in participial phrases
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using with incompatible nouns, confusion with spatial approach
   
   **Root Analysis**: ap- (toward) + proach (from proximare = come near) + -ing
   
   **Etymology**: Old French "approcher" + "-ing" → creating progressive/prepositional form
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's approaching fifty but looks thirty.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + nearly/almost + [verb/adjective/adverb]
   - [Position]: mid-position before main verb or adjective
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using with negatives incorrectly, placing after main verb
   
   **Root Analysis**: near + -ly / all + most → adverbial forms indicating approximation
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēar" + "-ly" / "ealmost" → adverbs indicating close approximation
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're nearly there—just five more minutes!
   - I almost forgot to tell you something important.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - [Clause structure]: [Noun/subject] + in proximity to + [noun/location]
   - [Position]: typically after main noun or verb phrase
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: redundancy ("close proximity"), overuse in informal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + proximity (proxim- = nearest) + to
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "proximitas" → English phrasal preposition pattern
