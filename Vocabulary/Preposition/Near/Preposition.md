   **When to Use**: Use "near" for general proximity without requiring immediate adjacency; when indicating approximate time or approaching deadlines; when describing closeness to achieving a goal or state; in both formal and informal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise adjacency is required (use "beside" or "next to"); incorrect for exact locations requiring "at" or "in"; not suitable when describing emotional closeness (use "close to" instead)

   **Root Analysis**: nēah (close, nigh) → near
