   **When to Use**: Use "in the near future" in formal or professional contexts to indicate upcoming events without specific dates; common in business, official communications, and formal announcements

   **Common Variations**: 
   - in the very near future
   - in the not-too-distant future
   - sometime in the near future
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Near future" is a temporal collocation where "near" specifically modifies "future" to indicate proximity in time; conventional usage in formal planning and announcements

   **Common Variations**: 
   - near-miss incident
   - near miss event
   - near miss collision
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Near miss" is a strong collocation used in safety and risk management contexts; conventional pairing where "near" intensifies the closeness of the potential negative event

   **Common Variations**: 
   - nowhere near enough
   - nowhere near ready
   - nowhere near finished/done
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Nowhere near" is an intensifying fixed phrase where "nowhere" (no place) + "near" creates emphatic negation of proximity; idiomatic construction
   
   **Root Analysis**: no + where (place) + near (close)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're nowhere near finished with this project yet.

   - hit close to home
   - too close to home
   - strike close to home
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Metaphorical expression using "home" as center of personal life; "close" indicates proximity to personal concerns; originated from the idea that events near one's home are more personally affecting

   **Common Variations**: 
   - in immediate proximity to
   - in direct proximity to
   - in geographic proximity to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Close proximity" is a common collocation, technically redundant (proximity already means nearness) but conventionally used for emphasis; "in...to" creates prepositional phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + close (near) + proximity (nearness) + to
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Metaphorical expression from military/hunting contexts where "striking distance" means close enough to attack or strike; extended to mean achievable proximity to any goal

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're within striking distance of first place in the league!
   - The finish line is within striking distance now.

   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Root Analysis**: near (close) + and + dear (beloved, precious)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Less common) As winter draws near, I start getting excited about the holidays.
