1. **Linking Word**: on account of (type: subordinating connector/causal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Because of; due to; used to introduce the reason or cause for something
   - *Function*: Expresses causation; links an effect to its cause; introduces explanatory information
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, by reason of, as a result of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding, irrespective of
   
   **When to Use**: Formal written contexts requiring elevated register; official reports and documents; academic writing (though less common than "due to"); professional explanations; contexts emphasizing formal causation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual everyday conversation (sounds pretentious); informal emails; when simpler "because of" or "due to" suffice; spoken English except in very formal speeches; when brevity is valued
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [main clause] + on account of + [noun phrase]
   - **Position**: typically mid-sentence or end-position after main clause
   - **Punctuation**: Usually no comma before "on account of" when it follows main clause; comma after if it begins sentence (rare)
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using "on account of" + clause instead of noun phrase; mixing formality levels in same text; overusing in casual contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (indicating position/basis) + account (reckoning, explanation) + of (possession/origin)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "on" + "acount" (from Old French "aconter" meaning to count/explain) + "of" → evolved to mean "by reason of" (15th century)

   **Root Analysis**: owing (being indebted/attributable) + to (indicating attribution)
