1. **Expression**: on account of (type: phrasal preposition)

   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed three-word prepositional phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, by reason of, as a result of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding
   
   **When to Use**: Formal written communication (reports, official letters, academic writing); professional contexts requiring elevated register; official announcements; legal and business documents; when precise formal causation needs expression
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual everyday conversation (sounds overly formal or pretentious); informal emails between colleagues; spoken English except formal speeches; modern casual business communication where simpler alternatives work better
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - because of (less formal, more versatile)
   - due to (semi-formal, widely used)
   - owing to (equally formal, slightly archaic)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal prepositions*: Historical development from "on" (indicating basis) + "account" (reckoning/explanation) + "of" (source) created fixed expression meaning "by reason of." The phrase became conventionalized in formal English as a sophisticated causal marker, particularly in written discourse. Its three-word structure signals formality and care in expression.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (prep: indicating basis/position) + account (n: from Old French "aconter" - to count, reckon, explain) + of (prep: indicating source/origin)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We cancelled on account of the rain. (sounds formal for casual speech)
   - Better casual: We cancelled because of the rain.

   **Antonyms**: overlook, ignore, disregard, neglect
   
   **When to Use**: All registers when discussing consideration of factors; professional decision-making contexts; analytical discussions; planning and evaluation contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simpler "consider" suffices; overly repetitive use in single text
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - take into consideration
   - take into account that [clause]
   - must take account of
   - failed to take into account
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Take" naturally combines with "account" because "account" in this context means "consideration/reckoning," and "take" metaphorically means "receive/accept." The partnership emerged from accounting/calculation metaphors where one "takes account" of numbers. Extended to mean considering any factors. Very high frequency of co-occurrence in both spoken and written English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: take (v: Old English "tacan" - grasp, receive) + into/of (preps) + account (n: reckoning, consideration)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You need to take into account how much it'll cost.

   **When to Use**: Formal contexts discussing accountability; professional situations requiring explanation; discussions of oversight and governance; contexts emphasizing responsibility
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual everyday situations about minor issues; when collaborative rather than confrontational tone is needed; informal contexts where simpler language works
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - held to account
   - bring to account
   - called to account for [specific actions]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Medieval origin from financial accounting practices where debtors were literally "called" to give an "account" (reckoning) of monies owed. Extended metaphorically to mean demanding any form of explanation or justification. The financial/legal origins give it formal, serious connotations retained in modern use.
   
   **Root Analysis**: call (v: summon) + to account (n: reckoning, explanation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They need to call him to account for what happened. (acceptable but formal)
   - Better casual: They need to hold him responsible for what happened.

   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (sounds overly formal); informal instructions; when simpler "never" or "don't" suffices
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - under no account (less common variant)
   - not on any account
   - on every account (all respects/reasons)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Developed from "on" (indicating basis) + "account" (reason, grounds). "On no account" literally means "on no grounds/for no reason." Historical legal and formal usage created strong fixedness. The expression carries weight of absolute prohibition, making it powerful in formal directives.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (prep: indicating basis) + no/any (determiners: quantity) + account (n: reason, grounds)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - On no account should you touch that! (very formal/emphatic for casual)

   **When NOT to Use**: Casual situations about minor matters; when shared responsibility is more appropriate; contexts requiring supportive rather than evaluative tone
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - held accountable for [actions]
   - be held accountable
   - must hold accountable
   - holding leaders accountable
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Hold" and "accountable" form natural partnership because "hold" suggests maintaining or enforcing a state, while "accountable" describes that state (being required to account for actions). Very high co-occurrence frequency in professional discourse. The collocation emerged from organizational and governance language as standard expression for responsibility enforcement.
   
   **Root Analysis**: hold (v: maintain, keep in position) + accountable (adj: required to give account/explanation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need to hold people accountable for their mistakes.
   - She was held accountable on account of being the project lead.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - by his/her account
   - by one's own account
   - by every account
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Account" here means "report" or "narrative." "By all accounts" literally means "according to all reports/narratives." Emerged from journalism and storytelling contexts where multiple witnesses or sources provided consistent "accounts." Fixed expression signals that information is widely corroborated rather than from single source.
   
   **Root Analysis**: by (prep: according to) + all (determiner: every) + accounts (n: reports, narratives)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - By all accounts, the party was amazing—everyone had a blast!
   - The new restaurant is, by all accounts, worth trying.

   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual contexts where simpler "did well/badly" suffices; when technical performance metrics are more appropriate
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - gave a creditable account
   - gave an excellent account of himself/herself
   - failed to give a good account
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Historical origin from medieval tournaments and battles where knights would "give account" (report) of their performance. Extended to mean any situation where one's performance reflects on personal reputation. "Account" metaphorically represents the narrative or story of one's actions—thus "giving a good account" means creating a favorable narrative through actions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: give (v: provide, present) + account (n: report, reckoning of conduct) + of oneself (reflexive: one's own performance)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He gave a good account of himself in the interview despite being nervous.
   - The team gave a poor account of themselves on account of lack of preparation.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Problem analysis contexts; discussions of missing information; investigation and inquiry contexts; analytical writing identifying gaps
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simpler "can't explain" or "overlooked" is clearer; overly casual contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - failed to account for
   - does not account for
   - cannot account for
   - unaccounted for
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Account for" means "explain" or "include in reckoning." Negating it creates expression meaning "fail to explain" or "omit from consideration." High frequency in analytical discourse identifying explanatory gaps. The negative construction emphasizes what's missing rather than what's present—useful for critical analysis.
   
   **Root Analysis**: not (negative) + to account for (explain, include in reckoning)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The theory doesn't account for these new findings.
   - We can't account for the missing time on account of incomplete records.
