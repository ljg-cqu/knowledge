1. **Linking Word**: above all (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces the most important point or consideration in a series; prioritizes one element above others
   - *Function*: Emphasizes primary importance; signals hierarchy in argument or list
   
   **Synonyms**: most importantly, primarily, first and foremost, chiefly, principally
   
   **Antonyms**: least importantly, lastly, finally, incidentally
   
   **When to Use**: Arguments requiring prioritization; lists with varying importance; emphatic statements; formal and informal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When all points have equal weight; when avoiding explicit ranking; when diplomatic neutrality preferred
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Point 1]. [Point 2]. Above all, [most important point].
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), can be mid-sentence with commas
   - [Punctuation]: followed by comma when sentence-initial; enclosed in commas mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use multiple times in same argument (weakens impact); avoid with "also" (contradicts exclusivity)
   
   **Root Analysis**: above (superior position) + all (totality) → prioritization marker
   
   **Etymology**: Spatial metaphor → discourse function (16th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
