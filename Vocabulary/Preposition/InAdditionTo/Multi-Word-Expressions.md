1. **Expression**: in addition to (type: phrasal preposition/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used before a noun or gerund to introduce something extra beyond what has already been mentioned; besides; as well as
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed phrasal preposition)
   
   **Synonyms**: besides, as well as, along with, apart from (additive sense)
   
   **Antonyms**: instead of, rather than, excluding, except for
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and semi-formal writing; academic papers; business documents; adding information or items to existing content; emphasizes addition
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual conversation (use "also," "and," or "plus"); beginning of sentences is less common (prefer "Additionally" or "Furthermore"); avoid redundancy with "additionally"
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in addition
   - addition to this/that
   - added in addition to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "In" (inclusion) + "addition" (the act of adding) + "to" (relation marker) form a fixed phrasal preposition that grammatically functions like a single preposition; conventional usage in formal English; frequency of co-occurrence makes this the standard formal way to express addition
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin in (in, within) + additio (adding) + to (direction/relation marker)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In addition to pizza, we should get some wings.
   - She's smart, and in addition to that, she's really nice.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: instead of, rather than, without
   
   **When to Use**: Informal and semi-formal contexts; emphasizing additional burden or responsibility; showing accumulation of items or problems
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal academic writing (use "in addition to"); can sound too casual for professional documents; avoid when positive additions are emphasized (use "in addition to")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - on top of that
   - on top of this
   - on top of everything (else)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Originated from spatial metaphor—items literally piling on top of each other → extended metaphorically to abstract accumulation of responsibilities, problems, or facts; first known use in additive sense from mid-20th century informal English
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English on (position) + topp (summit, highest point) + of (relation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I have three essays due, and on top of that, I have to work this weekend.
   - On top of being late, he forgot his wallet.

   **When to Use**: All registers from casual to formal; connecting parallel items; note: subject-verb agreement follows the first noun; emphasizes inclusion
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Common learner error: treating it like "and" for subject-verb agreement (incorrect: "Tom as well as his friends are coming"—should be "is coming"); when only one item needs emphasis
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as well as [noun/gerund]
   - [noun] as well as [noun]
   - doing X as well as Y
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "As" (comparison/equality marker) + "well" (satisfactorily, equally) + "as" (comparison) → conventional combination emphasizing equal status of connected items; semantic compatibility from comparison structure; high frequency of co-occurrence in English
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English combinations of as + well + as
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She speaks French as well as English.

   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal academic writing; when the additional item is minor rather than significant; creates emphasis, so use intentionally
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - not to mention the fact that
   - not to mention [noun]
   - not to mention [gerund]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Paradoxical expression (you mention something while saying you won't mention it) → used for rhetorical effect; emphasizes importance of the additional point; conventional usage developed from litotes (understatement for emphasis); first documented use in 18th-century rhetoric
   
   **Root Analysis**: not + to mention (from Latin mens, mind)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The car is expensive, not to mention the insurance costs.
   - He's rude and lazy, not to mention incompetent.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - coupled with the fact that
   - if coupled with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Coupled" (past participle of couple: to join) + "with" (association marker) → semantic compatibility from joining/connection meaning; conventional usage in formal English to emphasize combined impact; high frequency in academic and professional writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin copula (bond) → couple + with
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The rain, coupled with strong winds, made it dangerous to drive.
