1. **Preposition**: out (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Moving away from the inside of a place or container; not in or inside something
   - *(Spatial)* At a distance from a particular place; away from home or office
   - *(Abstract)* Not in a particular state or condition; excluded from something
   
   **Synonyms**: outside of (in context of location), away from (in context of movement), beyond (in context of limits)
   
   **Antonyms**: in, into, inside, within
   
   **When to Use**: Use "out" to express movement from inside to outside, absence from a location, exclusion from a group or state, or distance from a reference point. Common in spatial descriptions, directional phrases, and abstract states.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using "out" when you mean "from" without spatial movement (e.g., ~~"out Monday to Friday"~~ should be "from Monday to Friday"). Don't confuse "out" with "outside" in formal contexts where precision is needed. L1 interference: speakers of languages without spatial prepositions may overuse or misplace "out."
