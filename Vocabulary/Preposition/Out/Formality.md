   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher status contexts require formal; equals allow casual/semi-formal
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers/professional contexts need semi-formal to formal; close relationships allow casual
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Minor problems allow casual/humorous; significant issues require formal
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures prefer indirectness and formality in professional contexts
   - *Medium*: Written communication (especially email) typically requires more formality than spoken
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "figured out" in formal academic writing—sounds too casual and may undermine credibility
   - Using formal "determined the solution" with friends—sounds pretentious and creates social distance
   - Using humorous variants when others are frustrated—may seem insensitive or boastful
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In hierarchical cultures (e.g., many Asian contexts), using casual forms with superiors would be inappropriate regardless of personal relationship. American contexts generally accept more casual language across hierarchies.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Solving a technical problem with your development team → **Appropriate Variant**: "I worked it out" or "Got it!" (semi-formal/lively) - celebrates success without being too formal

   - Using humorous approach when other party is genuinely upset—trivializes their feelings and escalates conflict
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Direct conflict resolution is valued in low-context cultures (US, Germany, Netherlands); high-context cultures (Japan, China, Arab countries) may find direct "let's talk this out" too confrontational and prefer indirect mediation.

   *Avoid when*: Serious errors with consequences, professional mistakes, when others were harmed by error

   **Cultural Notes**: Direct error admission is valued in Western cultures but may cause significant face loss in cultures with high emphasis on saving face (many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures). In those contexts, indirect acknowledgment with focus on learning is preferred.
