1. **Linking Word**: except (type: subordinating conjunction/preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce the only thing or person that a statement does not apply to; with the exclusion of
   - *Function*: Creates exception relationship by excluding specific items from a general statement
   
   **Synonyms**: apart from, aside from, excluding, save (formal), but (after negative/question)
   
   **Antonyms**: including, as well as, together with, along with
   
   **When to Use**: When making exceptions to general statements. Common after negative statements, questions, and universal quantifiers (all, everyone, everything). Used in all registers and text types.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with "accept" (common spelling error). Avoid in very formal legal writing where "with the exception of" is preferred. Not appropriate when no exception exists.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Statement about group] + except + [noun/pronoun]: "Everyone came except Tom"
   - [Negative statement] + except: "Nobody knew except her"
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence after the main clause
   - [Punctuation]: no comma needed in most cases; comma used if followed by a clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "Except for" vs. "except" - use "except for" at sentence start; plain "except" mid-sentence
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + cept (take, seize) = "taken out"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin exceptus (taken out, excluded) → Old French excepter → English except (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like all vegetables except Brussels sprouts.
   - Everyone's going to the party except me.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All participants successfully completed the study except three individuals who withdrew.
   - The policy applies to all employees except those in temporary positions.

1. **Linking Word**: but (type: coordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (As exception marker) Used after negative statements or words like "all" to introduce an exception; except
   - *Function*: Creates exception after negative or universal quantifier; synonymous with "except" in this usage
   
   **Synonyms**: except, save (archaic/formal), other than
   
   **Antonyms**: and, including, with
   
   **When to Use**: After "all," "every," "any," "no," "none," "nothing," etc. to introduce exceptions. Particularly common in fixed expressions. More limited distribution than "except."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Cannot replace "except" in all contexts (*"I like all fruits but apples" is less natural than "except apples"). Primarily used after negative/universal quantifiers.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Universal quantifier] + but + [exception]: "All but two students passed"
   - [Negative] + but: "Nothing but complaints"
   - [Position]: mid-sentence after negative/universal element
   - [Punctuation]: no comma when used as exception marker (different from adversative "but")
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing exception "but" with contrast "but"—different functions require different comma rules
   
   **Root Analysis**: Germanic root meaning "outside" or "except"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English būtan (outside, except) → Middle English but → Modern English but (multiple senses including exception)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone but Sarah knows about the surprise party.
   - I've got nothing but problems with this computer.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All but three of the respondents indicated satisfaction with the service.
   - The committee found no violations but one minor procedural irregularity.

1. **Linking Word**: whereas (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to show contrast between two facts or situations, often highlighting that one thing is excluded or different from what was expected
   - *Function*: Creates contrastive relationship, implicitly excluding similarity between two situations
   
   **Synonyms**: while (when showing contrast), in contrast, on the other hand, conversely
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, in the same way, just as
   
   **When to Use**: In formal writing, legal documents, academic papers when contrasting two situations. Common in definitions, legal clauses, and academic comparisons. Shows exclusivity of characteristics.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (too formal), when simple "but" or "while" is more natural, when contrast is not the main point.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause 1] + whereas + [contrasting clause 2]: "X has property A, whereas Y has property B"
   - [Position]: typically sentence-initial when introducing contrast, or mid-sentence connecting two clauses
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "whereas" when mid-sentence; no comma after when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "whereas" in informal speech (sounds overly formal), forgetting comma punctuation
   
   **Root Analysis**: where + as (comparative)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "where as" (in the place that, considering that) → "whereas" (13th century, contrast sense developed later)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My brother loves spicy food, whereas I can't handle it at all.
   - She's an early bird, whereas I'm definitely a night owl.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Group A showed significant improvement, whereas Group B demonstrated no measurable change.
   - Whereas the previous policy included all employees, the revised version excludes temporary staff.

1. **Linking Word**: excluding (type: preposition/participial connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Not including; leaving out particular items from consideration
   - *Function*: Explicitly marks items as outside the scope of a statement or count
   
   **Synonyms**: not including, not counting, leaving out, omitting, barring
   
   **Antonyms**: including, counting, incorporating, with
   
   **When to Use**: When explicitly clarifying scope, especially with numbers, lists, or categories. Common in business, academic, and technical contexts where precision about inclusion/exclusion is important.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "except" is more natural, in very casual speech (use "not counting"), when exclusion should be downplayed rather than emphasized.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Statement/number] + excluding + [noun phrase]: "The cost is $500, excluding shipping"
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence or end-sentence after the main clause
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "excluding" when it functions as a non-restrictive modifier
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Dangling modifiers—ensure "excluding" clearly relates to the right element
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + clud (close) + -ing (present participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin excludere (to shut out) → English exclude → excluding (participial form, 16th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There are 15 people coming, excluding the kids.
   - The whole trip costs about $2000, excluding flights.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Total expenditures reached $1.5 million, excluding capital investments.
   - All participants were surveyed, excluding those who withdrew prior to completion.

1. **Linking Word**: save (type: preposition/conjunction - archaic/formal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Except; other than (formal or literary register)
   - *Function*: Introduces exception, synonymous with "except" but more elevated register
   
   **Synonyms**: except, but, apart from, aside from
   
   **Antonyms**: including, with, along with
   
   **When to Use**: Literary writing, formal or archaic contexts, legal documents, poetic language. Adds formality or traditional tone. Rare in modern everyday usage.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (sounds archaic), modern business writing (use "except"), when clarity is prioritized over style (unfamiliar to many speakers).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Statement] + save + [exception]: "All were lost save one"
   - [Position]: similar to "except," typically mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: follows same rules as "except"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using in contexts that require modern, clear language
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin salvare (to keep safe, preserve, set aside)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin salvare → Old French sauver → English save (exception sense emerged from "preserving/setting aside" an exception, 13th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rare in casual speech) All my friends attended, save Peter.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All provisions of the original agreement remain in effect, save those explicitly amended herein.
   - The territory remained under their control, save for a small coastal region.

1. **Linking Word**: other than (type: phrasal preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Except; apart from; used to introduce the only exception to a statement
   - *Function*: Introduces exception or alternative, often emphasizing that no other possibilities exist
   
   **Synonyms**: except, apart from, aside from, besides (in exception sense)
   
   **Antonyms**: as well as, in addition to, including
   
   **When to Use**: All registers. Particularly common after negative statements ("nothing other than") or in questions. More flexible position than "except."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "except" is simpler and clearer, in formal legal documents (where "with the exception of" is preferred).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Statement] + other than + [noun phrase]: "I have no concerns other than the budget"
   - [Question] + other than + [noun phrase]: "Who other than you could do this?"
   - [Position]: flexible—can appear at various positions in the sentence
   - [Punctuation]: typically no comma; comma used if non-restrictive or for clarity
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Redundancy with "except" (*"except other than" is redundant)
   
   **Root Analysis**: other (different) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Compound phrase formed in Middle English from "other" + "than," functioning as exception marker (15th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I don't know anyone here other than you.
   - Is there any way to solve this other than starting over?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The results suggest no significant differences other than those attributable to sampling variation.
