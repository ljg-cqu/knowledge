   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Not including; leaving out; with the exception of
   
   **Synonyms**: except (for), apart from, not including, not counting, barring
   
   **Antonyms**: including, counting, with, plus
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and semi-formal contexts when clarifying scope, especially with numbers, costs, lists, or categories. Common in business, academic, and technical writing where precision is important.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual speech (use "not counting"), when "except" is more natural and clear, when you want to downplay the exclusion.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: excluding [noun], excluding [noun phrase]
   - **Verb + prep**: calculated excluding, priced excluding, counted excluding
   - **Adjective + prep**: (rare with excluding)
   - **Noun + prep**: price excluding, cost excluding, total excluding
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + clud (close, shut) + -ing (present participle functioning as preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin excludere (to shut out) → English exclude → excluding (16th century, prepositional use)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're 15 people excluding the kids.
   - The dinner costs $30 per person, excluding drinks.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Total revenue reached $5 million, excluding extraordinary items.

   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Not including; other than; apart from; used to introduce the only exception to a statement
   
   **Synonyms**: apart from, aside from, but (after negative), save, excluding
   
   **Antonyms**: including, with, plus, along with
   
   **When to Use**: All registers and contexts when making exceptions. Most versatile and common preposition for expressing exclusion. Can follow positive or negative statements.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal legal writing may prefer "with the exception of" for added formality and precision.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: except [noun], except for [noun phrase]
   - **Verb + prep**: work except, apply except, include except
   - **Adjective + prep**: (rare—"except" typically doesn't follow adjectives)
   - **Noun + prep**: everyone except, everything except, all except
   - **Note**: Use "except for" at sentence start; "except" mid-sentence
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + cept (take, seize) = "taken out"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin exceptus (taken out, excluded) → Old French excepter → English except (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like all fruits except bananas.
   - Everyone's here except Tom.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Preposition**: besides (type: simple preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* (Archaic) Next to, at the side of
   - *(Abstract)* In addition to; as well as; other than (in negative/question contexts meaning "except")
   
   **Synonyms**: apart from (in negative contexts), other than, except (in negatives), in addition to (in positive contexts), as well as
   
   **Antonyms**: only, solely, exclusively
   
   **When to Use**: "Besides" in modern English primarily means "in addition to" in positive statements. In negative/question contexts, it can mean "except." This dual meaning causes learner confusion.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using "besides" when you mean "except" in positive statements—this is a common error. In American English, prefer "except" for exclusion to avoid ambiguity.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: besides [noun], besides [gerund]
   - **Verb + prep**: do besides, have besides
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Common errors**: Using "besides" for "except" in positive statements: *"Everyone besides John came" (ambiguous—use "except")
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by) + side + -s (genitive marker, now fossilized) = "by the side"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English be sīdan (by the side) → Middle English besides → Modern English besides (meaning evolved from spatial to abstract)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Besides you, who else knows about this? (meaning "except")
   - Besides going to work, I also volunteer on weekends. (meaning "in addition to")

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: apart from [noun], apart from [gerund]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Context clues**: Positive context suggests "except"; list context suggests "in addition to"
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + part (separated piece) + from (preposition)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: aside from [noun], aside from [noun phrase]
   - **Position**: typically sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Context determines meaning**: Exception vs. addition usually clear from context
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + side + from (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English on side from → aside from (prepositional phrase, 15th century)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: without [noun], without [gerund]
   - **Verb + prep**: go without, do without, live without, proceed without
   - **Adjective + prep**: (rare—"without" primarily follows verbs)
   - **Common patterns**: "without [verb]-ing" = excluding that action
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (alongside) + out (outside) = "on the outside"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English wiþūtan (on the outside) → Middle English without → Modern English without
