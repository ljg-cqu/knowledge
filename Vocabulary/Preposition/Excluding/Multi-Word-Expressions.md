1. **Expression**: with the exception of (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce the only person or thing that a statement does not apply to; formal way of saying "except"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (this exact wording is conventional in formal contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: except for, apart from, aside from, excluding, save for
   
   **Antonyms**: including, together with, in addition to
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing, legal documents, business communications, academic papers, official announcements when making specific exceptions to general rules or statements.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (too formal—use "except" instead), when multiple exceptions exist (becomes repetitive), informal writing where brevity is valued.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - with the sole exception of (emphasizes only one exception)
   - with the notable exception of (highlights significance of the exception)
   - with few exceptions (indicates multiple but rare exceptions)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: Conventional legal and formal register expression that evolved from Latin legal terminology. The full phrasal form adds gravity and precision appropriate for formal contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: exception (from Latin exceptio "taking out") in fixed prepositional phrase structure
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone passed the test with the exception of two students.
   - All the restaurants were closed, with the exception of the diner on Main Street.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All employees are required to comply with the new policy, with the exception of those hired before January 2020.

1. **Expression**: leave out (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To not include someone or something; to exclude deliberately or accidentally; to omit
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed verb-particle combination with specific meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: exclude, omit, skip, miss out, not include
   
   **Antonyms**: include, incorporate, add in, count in
   
   **When to Use**: All registers. When discussing intentional or accidental omissions in lists, groups, plans, or accounts. Common in instructions, feedback, and social contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal academic writing (prefer "omit" or "exclude"), when permanent exclusion is meant (use "exclude"), legal documents (prefer precise terminology).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - leave someone/something out
   - get left out (passive, often social exclusion)
   - feel left out (psychological impact of exclusion)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Leave" + "out" creates a clear spatial metaphor of putting something outside the boundaries. The particle "out" concretizes the abstract act of exclusion. High frequency of co-occurrence in both literal and figurative contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: leave (Old English læfan "to let remain") + out (spatial particle) = "cause to remain outside"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don't leave me out! I want to come too.
   - You left out the best part of the story!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Please ensure that you do not leave out any relevant information from your application.

1. **Expression**: rule out (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To exclude something as a possibility; to decide that something is not possible or suitable; to eliminate from consideration
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed verb-particle combination)
   
   **Synonyms**: exclude, eliminate, dismiss, reject, discount
   
   **Antonyms**: include, consider, keep as an option, leave open
   
   **When to Use**: Decision-making contexts, medical diagnosis, investigations, problem-solving when eliminating possibilities systematically. All registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When options remain open (premature use sounds dismissive), social contexts about people (sounds harsh—use "exclude" more carefully).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - can't rule out (leaving possibility open)
   - rule out the possibility of
   - rule something out entirely
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Rule" (make a decision/judgment) + "out" (exclusion) creates a decisive act of elimination. Common in legal, medical, and investigative discourse where systematic exclusion of possibilities is routine. Very high frequency pairing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: rule (from Latin regula "straight stick, pattern") + out (exclusion particle) = "decide to exclude by judgment"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We can't rule out the possibility that he just forgot.
   - The doctor ruled out cancer, which was a huge relief.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The investigation has ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of the accident.

1. **Expression**: shut out (type: phrasal verb)

   **Synonyms**: exclude, lock out, keep out, bar, ostracize
   
   **Antonyms**: include, let in, welcome, embrace, involve
   
   **When to Use**: When describing deliberate exclusion, particularly with emotional connotations. Common in social relationships, psychological contexts, and sports (shutout = preventing opponent from scoring).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Professional contexts where neutral language is preferred (use "exclude"), when accidental omission occurred (use "leave out").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - feel shut out (experience exclusion)
   - shut someone out emotionally
   - get shut out (passive experience)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The strong partnership comes from the literal image of closing a door with someone on the outside. Extended metaphorically to emotional and social exclusion. The particle "out" is essential to the exclusion meaning.
   
   **Root Analysis**: shut (Old English scyttan "to bar, bolt") + out (spatial/exclusion particle) = "close with exclusion"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He really shut me out after the argument—won't even talk to me.
   - I felt shut out when they made all the decisions without me.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: put aside, reserve, exclude temporarily, bracket, table
   
   **Antonyms**: address immediately, include now, consider presently
   
   **When to Use**: Meeting management, budgeting (set aside funds), discussion organization (set aside topic), legal contexts (set aside verdict). Professional and formal registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When immediate action is needed (sounds like avoidance), casual conversation (more natural alternatives exist like "save" or "put away").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - set aside time/money
   - set aside differences
   - set aside a decision/verdict (legal)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Set" (place deliberately) + "aside" (to the side, separate from main) creates image of deliberate, temporary exclusion with intent to return. Medium fixedness because other particles can work with "set" in different meanings (set up, set down, set out).
   
   **Root Analysis**: set (Old English settan "to place") + aside (to the side) = "place to the side"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's set aside that argument and just enjoy dinner.
   - I try to set aside some money each month for emergencies.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The court decided to set aside the lower court's ruling.

   **Synonyms**: exclude, leave out, not include, discount, rule out
   
   **Antonyms**: count in, include, involve, sign up
   
   **When to Use**: Planning activities, forming teams, making group decisions when someone opts out or is excluded. Somewhat informal. Often used with "me" in first person ("count me out").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal writing (prefer "exclude"), when permanent exclusion is harsh reality (sounds casual for serious situations).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - count me out (I don't want to participate)
   - don't count me out (I still have a chance)
   - count someone out of something
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Count" (include in enumeration) + "out" (exclusion) creates opposite of "count in." The partnership is strong because the particle reverses the meaning completely. Common in informal planning discourse.
   
   **Root Analysis**: count (from Latin computare "to calculate") + out (exclusion particle) = "calculate as excluded"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you're going hiking, count me out—I hate bugs.
   - Count Jim out; he said he can't make it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - (*Typically informal; avoid in formal contexts*)

1. **Expression**: keep out (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To prevent someone or something from entering; to exclude from a space or activity; to stay away from
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed verb-particle combination)

   **Antonyms**: let in, allow entry, welcome, admit, include
   
   **When to Use**: Physical exclusion from spaces (doors, properties), metaphorical exclusion from affairs or businesses. All registers. Often used in warnings and prohibitions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When inclusion is the goal, in contexts where exclusion sounds hostile rather than protective.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - keep someone/something out
   - keep out of (stay away from someone's business)
   - "Keep Out" (sign/warning)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Keep" (maintain a state) + "out" (outside position) creates sustained exclusion, different from one-time "shut out." Implies ongoing effort to maintain exclusion. Strong partnership with very high frequency.
   
   **Root Analysis**: keep (Old English cepan "to seize, hold") + out (spatial particle) = "maintain in excluded position"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep out of my room! This means you!
   - I try to keep out of their arguments—not my business.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The barrier is designed to keep out unauthorized personnel.
