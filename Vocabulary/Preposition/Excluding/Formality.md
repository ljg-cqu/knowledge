   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher status requires more formal language ("With the exception of")
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers require semi-formal ("Excluding"), close friends allow casual ("Not counting")

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "besides" when meaning "except" - "Everyone besides him" (incorrect) vs. "Everyone except him" (correct)
