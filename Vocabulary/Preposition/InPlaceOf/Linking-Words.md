   - *Function*: Shows substitution or alternative choice; connects contrasting actions or situations
   
   **Synonyms**: alternatively, rather, as an alternative, in place of that
   
   **Antonyms**: also, additionally, furthermore, moreover
   
   **When to Use**: Connecting two contrasting choices or actions; showing what was done in place of something else; in both formal and informal writing; emphasizing the alternative taken
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When adding information rather than substituting; when both actions occur (use "also" or "in addition")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about what didn't happen]. Instead, [statement about what did happen].
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: Period before "instead" when starting new sentence; comma before when ending sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "instead" when both actions occur; forgetting punctuation
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + stead (place)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "in stede of" → Modern English "instead" (adverb showing substitution)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Chosen option] rather than [rejected option]; [Subject] [verb] X rather than Y
   - [Position]: mid-sentence connecting two parallel structures
   - [Punctuation]: No comma needed before "rather than" in most cases
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Comma splices; non-parallel structures (e.g., "to swim rather than running")
   
   **Root Analysis**: rather (preferably) + than (comparison marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hraþor" (sooner, more readily) + "than" → preference comparison structure

   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using in casual contexts; overuse in informal writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + lieu (French = place) + of
