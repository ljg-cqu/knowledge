1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Preposition vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Preposition*, capture the small set of ideas that explain what English prepositions do, how their meanings are organized, and how learners should approach them as vocabulary patterns rather than random little words.
   - **Scope**: Focus on high-leverage understanding of English prepositions as relationship markers (space, time, abstract relations) and as parts of common chunks (prepositional phrases, verb/adjective/noun + preposition patterns, phrasal verbs). Excludes a full grammar treatment, exhaustive lists, or rare idioms; those live in detailed reference files.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What role do prepositions play in sentences, and what exactly do they "mean"?
     - Which few relationship types and structural patterns cover most everyday preposition use?
     - How should learners organize and practice prepositions so they stick and errors go down?
     - Where do preposition errors create the most confusion or unnatural English?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Relationship domain**: spatial / temporal / abstract (cause, purpose, manner, topic, comparison, etc.).
     - **Structure**: simple / compound / phrasal prepositions; free vs part of a phrasal verb.
     - **Chunk type**: prepositional phrase vs dependent preposition after a verb/adjective/noun vs fixed expression.
     - **Precision & register**: approximate vs exact meanings; casual vs formal/academic choices.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Preposition*: A word (often short) that links a noun or pronoun to another word and shows a relationship such as place, time, or cause (for example, *in, on, at, for, with*).
     - *Object of the preposition*: The noun or pronoun that follows a preposition and completes its meaning (for example, *in the room*, *for her*).
     - *Prepositional phrase*: A preposition plus its object (and modifiers) that functions together as one unit (for example, *in the morning*, *at the station*).
     - *Dependent preposition*: A preposition that commonly follows a particular verb, adjective, or noun (for example, *interested in*, *good at*, *reason for*).
     - *Phrasal verb*: A verb combined with a particle or preposition (for example, *look after*, *give up*) whose meaning is not just the sum of the parts.
     - *Collocation*: A natural combination of words that usually appear together (for example, *depend on*, *on time*, *in charge of*).
     - *Spatial / temporal / abstract use*: Three broad ways prepositions express relationships: physical space, time, and more figurative links like cause, topic, or manner.

     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.

1. Q: Essence card – Prepositions mark relationships, not objects
   A:
   - **Label**: Prepositions mark relationships, not objects
   - **Core Idea**: Prepositions do not name things; they signal how one element relates to another in space, time, or abstract ways (for example, *on the table*, *in July*, *for health*). The same preposition can connect many different words as long as the underlying relationship type fits.
   - **Why It Matters**: Treating prepositions as "relationship markers" rather than random tiny words helps learners look for the link they express and choose between options like *in / on / at* based on the relationship, not translation from their first language.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Relationship domain = spatial / temporal / abstract; Chunk type = prepositional phrase.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - preposition
     - object of the preposition
     - spatial / temporal / abstract use

1. Q: Essence card – Three big domains: space, time, abstract
   A:
   - **Label**: Three big domains: space, time, abstract
   - **Core Idea**: Most everyday preposition uses cluster into three domains: where something is or moves (space), when it happens (time), and how or why it happens (abstract relations like cause, purpose, topic, manner, comparison).
   - **Why It Matters**: Organizing prepositions by these domains lets learners build a mental map: first master basic spatial uses, then see how the same forms extend to time and abstract meanings, instead of memorizing long unsorted lists.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Relationship domain = spatial / temporal / abstract; Precision & register = from concrete to more abstract, formal uses.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - spatial use
     - temporal use
     - abstract use

1. Q: Essence card – Learn prepositions in chunks and collocations
   A:
   - **Label**: Learn prepositions in chunks and collocations
   - **Core Idea**: Prepositions are most stable inside common chunks such as prepositional phrases (*on the weekend*), verb + preposition (*depend on*), adjective + preposition (*afraid of*), and noun + preposition (*reason for*). Learners remember and use these better than isolated single words.
   - **Why It Matters**: Most serious errors come from choosing a preposition that does not fit the usual collocation. Focusing on high-frequency chunks directly improves naturalness and accuracy in real sentences.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Chunk type = prepositional phrase / dependent preposition; Relationship domain = mostly abstract in verb/adjective/noun + preposition patterns.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - dependent preposition
     - collocation
     - prepositional phrase

1. Q: Essence card – Structural types: simple, compound, phrasal
   A:
   - **Label**: Structural types: simple, compound, phrasal
   - **Core Idea**: English prepositions come in simple one-word forms (*in, on, at*), compound forms (*into, onto, throughout*), and multi-word or phrasal forms (*in front of, because of, in spite of*). Many tricky meanings live in these longer forms, not in the simple core alone.
   - **Why It Matters**: Noticing which structural type you are dealing with stops learners from splitting or dropping parts (for example, saying *despite of* or *because* instead of *because of*) and guides which entries belong on separate vocabulary cards.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Structure = simple / compound / phrasal; Precision & register = some phrasal forms are more informal, others more formal.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - simple preposition
     - compound preposition
     - phrasal preposition

1. Q: Essence card – High-risk contrasts drive learning priorities
   A:
   - **Label**: High-risk contrasts drive learning priorities
   - **Core Idea**: A small set of preposition contrasts (*in / on / at* for place and time, *for / since*, *by / with*, *to / for*, *in / into / within*) causes a large share of learner mistakes and misunderstandings.
   - **Why It Matters**: Prioritizing practice around these contrasts gives the biggest payoff for clarity and correctness in exams, emails, and everyday talk; rare obscure prepositions can wait until the high-risk pairs are under control.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Relationship domain = spatial / temporal / abstract; Precision & register = accurate vs approximate choice in common contexts.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - at / in / on
     - to vs for
     - for vs since
