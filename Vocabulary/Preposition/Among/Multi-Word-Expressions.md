# Extract Multi-Word Expressions for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract multi-word expressions (collocations, idioms, phrases, fixed expressions) that are essential for fluent, native-like communication from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one multi-word expression with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, fixedness level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all multi-word expressions that represent natural word partnerships or carry special meaning
- Prioritize: collocations, idiomatic expressions, fixed phrases, binomials, phrasal constructions, domain-specific multi-word terms
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and culturally significant expressions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both transparent collocations and opaque idioms

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in expressions actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- **Collocations (transparent meaning)**:

  - Verb + adverb (argue strongly, apologize profusely, examine closely)
  - Noun + verb (prices rise, rain falls, heart beats)
  - Noun + noun (round of applause, sense of humor, word of mouth)
  - Verb + preposition + noun (rely on intuition, result in failure)

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Expression**: among others (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate that there are additional items, people, or things besides those already mentioned
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed discourse marker)
   
   **Synonyms**: inter alia (Latin, formal), including but not limited to, and more, et cetera, to name a few
   
   **Antonyms**: exclusively, only, solely, specifically
   
   **When to Use**: Use in lists when you want to acknowledge that the list is not exhaustive; appropriate in both formal and informal contexts; commonly used in academic writing, reports, and casual conversation to indicate selective examples
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overuse (sounds vague); don't use when complete enumeration is required; not appropriate in legal contexts requiring precision (use "including but not limited to")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - among other things
   - among other factors
   - among other reasons
   - among many others
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Fixed phrase*: Functions as a discourse marker signaling non-exhaustive enumeration; historically developed from the literal spatial meaning of "among" to abstract usage indicating membership in a larger set
   
   **Root Analysis**: among (in the company of) + others (additional members)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The restaurant serves pizza, pasta, and burgers, among others.
   - She speaks English, Spanish, and French, among others.

   **Synonyms**: inter alia, including, additionally, also, furthermore

   **Common Variations**: 
   - among many other things
   - among several other things
   - among countless other things
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Fixed phrase*: Functions as a hedging device and discourse marker; "things" serves as a general placeholder for unspecified items, making this highly versatile across contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: among + other + things (general placeholder)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I need to buy milk, eggs, and bread, among other things, before the store closes.
   - He's annoying because, among other things, he never listens when you talk to him.

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts with clear hierarchical structures; not appropriate when describing explicit leadership roles; can sound pretentious in casual conversation
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - a first among equals
   - the first among equals
   - primus inter pares (Latin variant)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Idiom*: Originated from Latin "primus inter pares," used in ancient Rome to describe the emperor's role; the English translation "first among equals" captures the paradoxical nature of equal status with acknowledged leadership
   
   **Root Analysis**: first (primary) + among (within a group) + equals (peers of same status)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In our friend group, Sarah is kind of the first among equals—we all have a say, but everyone looks to her to make final decisions.

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts requiring precise quantification; less appropriate for purely numerical counting; can sound formal in very casual conversation
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - count someone/something among
   - count yourself among
   - be counted among
   - proud to count among
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Collocation*: "Count" naturally pairs with "among" when expressing membership in a group; semantic compatibility stems from "count" (enumeration/inclusion) combining with "among" (group membership)
   
   **Root Analysis**: count (enumerate, include) + among (within a group)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm lucky to count you among my closest friends.
   - He counts among the best guitarists I've ever heard.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - divide equally among
   - divide fairly among
   - divide evenly among
   - be divided among
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Collocation*: "Divide" requires a preposition indicating distribution pattern; "among" specifically signals distribution to three or more recipients; this partnership is semantically motivated by the need to express multiple-way division
   
   **Root Analysis**: divide (separate into parts) + among (distributed to multiple members of a group)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's divide the pizza among the five of us—everyone gets two slices.
   - We need to divide the work among the team members so no one gets overwhelmed.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - particularly popular among
   - increasingly popular among
   - highly popular among
   - most popular among
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Collocation*: "Popular" requires a preposition indicating the group showing preference; "among" is the standard prepositional choice for expressing acceptance within a group; this is a dependent preposition pattern
   
   **Root Analysis**: popular (well-liked, from Latin "populus" meaning "people") + among (within a group)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That new coffee shop is really popular among college students.
   - Korean dramas have become super popular among my friends lately.

   - most common among
   - less common among
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Collocation*: "Common" requires a preposition indicating the group exhibiting the trait; "among" is the standard choice for expressing prevalence within a group; dependent preposition pattern
   
   **Root Analysis**: common (occurring frequently) + among (within a group)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Anxiety about exams is pretty common among students, so don't worry—you're not alone.
   - That kind of thinking is common among people our age.

   - rank among the best
   - rank among the top
   - rank among the worst
   - rank highly among
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *Collocation*: "Rank" as an intransitive verb requires "among" to indicate the reference group for comparison; semantic compatibility from "rank" (position in hierarchy) and "among" (within a group)
   
   **Root Analysis**: rank (assign position or status) + among (within a comparative group)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That movie ranks among my all-time favorites—I've probably watched it ten times.
   - She ranks among the best players on the team.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
