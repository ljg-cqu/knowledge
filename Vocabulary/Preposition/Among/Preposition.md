# Extract Prepositions for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract prepositions (simple, compound, phrasal prepositions) that are essential for expressing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one preposition with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, common patterns, prepositional phrases, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all prepositions expressing relationships between elements
- Prioritize: prepositions with multiple meanings, abstract/metaphorical uses, prepositional phrases, and prepositions commonly confused by learners
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and challenging prepositions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both literal and figurative uses

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in prepositions actually present in source
- Never invent prepositions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Simple prepositions (in, on, at, by, with, for, to, from, etc.)
- Compound prepositions (into, onto, upon, throughout, etc.)
- Phrasal prepositions (in front of, on behalf of, in spite of, etc.)
- Spatial relationships (location, direction, movement)
- Temporal relationships (time, duration, sequence)
- Abstract relationships (agency, purpose, manner, possession)
- Dependent prepositions (verb + preposition, adjective + preposition)

**Format:**
- **Preposition**: [word/phrase] (type: simple/compound/phrasal)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *If preposition has multiple senses, number them clearly*
  - *Cover spatial, temporal, and abstract meanings*
  - *Use simple, clear language to explain relationships*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 prepositions with similar meaning (in specific contexts)
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 prepositions with opposite meaning (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or relationships where this preposition is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this preposition would be incorrect (common learner errors)
- **Common Patterns**: 
  - Prepositional phrases
  - Verb + preposition combinations
  - Adjective + preposition combinations
  - Noun + preposition combinations
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (for compound prepositions)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Preposition**: among (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Surrounded by; in the middle of; in the company of (three or more people/things)
   - *(Abstract)* Indicating membership or inclusion in a group, category, or collection
   - *(Distributive)* Expressing division or distribution among members of a group
   - *(Comparative)* Used when comparing one member with other members of a group
   
   **Synonyms**: amid (in context of being surrounded), amongst (British variant), between (when only two entities), within (in context of a group)
   
   **Antonyms**: outside of, apart from, separate from, excluded from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "among" for groups of three or more; in both physical and abstract contexts; when expressing membership, distribution, or comparison within a group; appropriate in all registers from casual to formal
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "among" for only two entities (use "between"); avoid in contexts requiring precise spatial boundaries (use "in" or "within"); common error: using "among" when "between" is needed for two items
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: among friends, among colleagues, among the crowd, among the options, among the best, among other things
   - **Verb + prep**: distribute among, divide among, share among, count among, rank among, number among
   - **Adjective + prep**: popular among, common among, rare among, prevalent among, divided among
   - **Noun + prep**: discussion among, agreement among, consensus among, conflict among, relationship among
   
   **Root Analysis**: among = a- (on, in) + -mong (related to Old English "gemang" meaning "mingling, crowd")
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "ongemang" → Middle English "among, amonge" → Modern English "among" (meaning "in the company of, surrounded by a group")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's really popular among her friends because she's always there when they need her.
   - We need to split the bill among the four of us—it comes to about twenty bucks each.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The research findings indicate significant variations among the participant groups.
   - Among the proposed solutions, this approach demonstrates the highest potential for sustainable impact.

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on prepositions that are essential for accurate expression
- Prioritize prepositions with learning value (multiple meanings, common errors, abstract uses)
- Clearly distinguish spatial, temporal, and abstract meanings
- Highlight dependent prepositions (collocations) as these are challenging for learners
