# Extract Formality Variants for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract expressions (words, phrases, sentences) from the source text and generate equivalent variants across formality registers to help learners understand appropriate language choices for different contexts.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one communicative intent or expression, providing multiple variants across formality levels (Casual, Semi-Formal, Formal) and stylistic registers (Humorous, Lively, Empathetic) with comprehensive context guidance.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify expressions where register choice significantly impacts appropriateness and effectiveness
- Prioritize: expressions with clear register sensitivity, professional/social interactions, opinions/requests/refusals, descriptive language
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact communicative intents)
- Do not skip sections; cover both explicit statements and implicit communicative functions

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all variants in realistic, natural language usage
- Never create artificial or unnatural expressions
- Ensure semantic equivalence across variants—same core meaning, different register
- Derive context sensitivity from actual usage patterns

**Focus:**
- Expressions with significant register variation (casual ↔ formal spectrum)
- Professional communication needs (emails, meetings, presentations, reports)
- Social interaction patterns (requests, refusals, agreements, disagreements, opinions)
- Tone modulation (neutral ↔ humorous ↔ lively ↔ empathetic)
- Cross-cultural formality expectations
- Common learner errors in register selection

**Format:**
- **Original Expression**: [expression from source] (context: [brief description])
- **Core Intent**: Simple statement of what the speaker wants to communicate
- **Casual**: Natural informal variant (friends, close colleagues, relaxed settings)
- **Semi-Formal**: Neutral professional variant (general workplace, polite strangers, standard business)
- **Formal**: Academic/official variant (authority figures, legal contexts, academic writing, ceremonies)
- **Humorous**: Engaging playful variant (appropriate humor, rapport-building)
- **Lively**: Energetic expressive variant (enthusiasm, engagement, storytelling)
- **Empathetic**: Emotionally attuned variant (support, understanding, emotional validation)
- **Register Selection Guide**: Decision criteria for choosing appropriate formality level
- **Common Mistakes**: Typical errors learners make with this expression type
- **Cultural Notes**: Cross-cultural formality expectations (if applicable)
- **Context Examples**: 3-4 specific situations showing appropriate variant selection

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Original Expression**: among (vs. amongst)  
   **Context**: Choosing between "among" and "amongst" in various contexts
   
   **Core Intent**: Indicating location, distribution, or membership within a group of three or more
   
   **Casual**: among  
   *Characteristics*: Modern, standard, universally accepted; no archaic feel; default choice in American English  
   *Use when*: All casual conversations, friendly emails, text messages, everyday speech
   
   **Semi-Formal**: among  
   *Characteristics*: Professional standard, clear, contemporary; preferred in modern business writing  
   *Use when*: Business communications, professional emails, reports, standard workplace interactions
   
   **Formal**: among / amongst (optional stylistic choice)  
   *Characteristics*: "Among" is standard; "amongst" adds slightly more formal or literary tone; "amongst" more common in British English formal writing  
   *Use when*: Academic papers, formal speeches, legal documents, ceremonial occasions
   
   **Humorous**: amongst (playfully archaic)  
   *Characteristics*: Can be used ironically or playfully for comic effect, suggesting mock-formality  
   *Use when*: Joking with friends, playful exaggeration, creating humorous contrast  
   *Avoid when*: Humor may be misunderstood, professional contexts, unfamiliar audiences
   
   **Lively**: among  
   *Characteristics*: Crisp, modern, energetic feel; maintains narrative pace  
   *Use when*: Storytelling, engaging presentations, dynamic writing
   
   **Empathetic**: among

   *Use when*: Supportive conversations, counseling, inclusive communication
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Regional Variation*: "Among" preferred in American English; "amongst" more acceptable in British English
   - *Temporal Context*: "Among" is modern standard; "amongst" can sound archaic or overly formal
   - *Audience Expectations*: Younger audiences strongly prefer "among"; older British audiences may accept "amongst"
   - *Medium*: "Among" works everywhere; "amongst" primarily in written formal or literary contexts
   - *Style Preference*: Use "among" as default; use "amongst" only for specific stylistic effect
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "amongst" in casual American English—sounds pretentious or archaic
   - Mixing "among" and "amongst" inconsistently in the same document—pick one style
   - Using "amongst" to sound more formal when audience expects contemporary language—can backfire
   
   **Cultural Notes**: "Amongst" is more acceptable in British English formal writing but declining in usage; in American English, "amongst" is generally viewed as archaic or affected except in deliberately formal or literary contexts
