1. **Adjective**: round (comp: rounder, sup: roundest)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Shaped like a circle or ball; having a curved shape with no angles or corners.
   - *(Sense 2)* Complete; full (used to emphasize a number or amount, e.g., "a round dozen").
   - *(Sense 3)* (of numbers) Expressed as a whole number, especially one ending in zero, rather than exactly.
   - *Gradable adjective; can be used both attributively and predicatively*
   
   **Synonyms**: circular, spherical, curved, rounded, cylindrical
   
   **Antonyms**: square, angular, flat, pointed, sharp
   
   **When to Use**: When describing physical shapes (objects, faces, body parts), approximate numbers, or complete amounts. Use in both casual and formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precision is required for measurements or when describing shapes with defined angles or edges.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - round face
   - round table
   - round number
   - round figure
   - in round terms
   
   **Root Analysis**: round (from Latin "rotundus" = circular, wheel-like)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "rotundus" → Old French "roond" → Middle English "round" (12th century). Originally referred to circular shapes, later extended to mean complete or approximate.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She has a round face and bright eyes.
   - Just give me a round number—I don't need the exact figure.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee convened at a round table to ensure equal participation.

1. **Adjective**: circular
   **Meaning**: 
   - Having the shape of a circle; round.
   - *(Sense 2)* (of reasoning or argument) Using the conclusion as part of the proof; not valid because it assumes what it is trying to prove.
   - *Gradable adjective; primarily attributive*
   
   **Synonyms**: round, ring-shaped, annular, curved, rotund
   
   **Antonyms**: linear, straight, angular, rectangular
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing the precise circular shape (especially in technical, mathematical, or design contexts), or when describing logical fallacies.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for spherical (3D) objects—"circular" typically refers to 2D shapes. Don't use for approximate descriptions where "round" is more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - circular motion
   - circular reasoning
   - circular path
   - circular saw

   **Antonyms**: flat, planar, angular, cubic, cylindrical
   
   **When to Use**: In technical, scientific, or formal contexts when describing three-dimensional round objects. Common in astronomy, geometry, physics, and geography.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "round" is more natural. Don't use for flat circular shapes (use "circular" instead).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - spherical shape
   - spherical coordinates
   - spherical trigonometry
   - spherical surface
   - nearly spherical
   
   **Root Analysis**: spher (Greek "sphaira" = ball, globe) + -ical (adjective suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Greek "sphairikos" → Late Latin "sphaericus" → English "spherical" (1570s). Technical term from mathematics and astronomy.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The earth isn't perfectly spherical—it bulges at the equator.
   - Those spherical ornaments look great on the tree.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - Calculations assumed a spherical model for simplification.

1. **Adjective**: rounded

   **When to Use**: When describing smooth curves (especially edges or corners), or when describing complete development (education, personality, skills).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for perfectly circular shapes where "round" or "circular" is more precise. Don't use for incomplete development.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - rounded edges
   - rounded corners
   - well-rounded education
   - rounded shoulders
   - rounded vowel
