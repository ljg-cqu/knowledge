1. **Adjective**: adjacent (gradable: no)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Next to or very near something; sharing a common border, wall, or point of contact
   - *(Non-gradable)* Normally not used with degree adverbs like "very" (you are either adjacent or not), though "immediately adjacent" is common
   
   **Synonyms**: next to, adjoining, contiguous, neighbouring, side-by-side
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, remote, separate, detached, faraway
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjacent" in formal or technical contexts (architecture, geography, maths) when emphasising that two spaces or objects are directly next to each other. It often appears in diagrams, manuals, exam questions, and academic texts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Feels too formal for everyday speech ("next to" or "right next to" sounds more natural). Avoid when there is a noticeable gap; "near" is better when things are simply in the same area.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - adjacent rooms
   - adjacent buildings
   - adjacent cells
   - adjacent to the park
   - immediately adjacent properties
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to, toward) + jacent (lying)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin "adjacēns" (lying near), via Old French, giving English "adjacent" as a formal adjective for things next to each other.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our bedroom is adjacent to the bathroom—basically right next to it.
   - The café is in a building adjacent to the station.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The two laboratories occupy adjacent rooms next to the central corridor.
   - Adjacent parcels of land next to the highway were acquired for the project.

1. **Adjective**: adjoining (gradable: no)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Of rooms, buildings, or pieces of land) next to and often connected to each other
   
   **Synonyms**: adjacent, next-door, connecting, directly next to, continuous
   
   **Antonyms**: separate, detached, isolated, stand-alone
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjoining" when two rooms or properties are next to each other and usually share a wall or door ("adjoining rooms" in a hotel). It is common in real estate, hospitality, and building descriptions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not natural for small movable objects (we do not usually say "adjoining chairs"); "side-by-side" or "next to each other" is better. Feels slightly formal for very casual talk.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - adjoining room
   - adjoining property
   - adjoining office
   - adjoining land/plot
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to, toward) + join (connect) + -ing (forming an adjective)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French "ajoinre" (to join), giving English "adjoin" and then the participial adjective "adjoining" to describe spaces that are joined next to each other.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We got two adjoining rooms so the kids could sleep next to us.
   - Their house and ours are adjoining—our kitchens back onto each other.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Adjoining offices located next to the main corridor facilitate collaboration.
   - The report covers the main facility and the adjoining warehouse.

1. **Adjective**: next-door (gradable: no)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Immediately next to your home or building; in the house, flat, or office beside yours
   - By extension, belonging to or typical of a very ordinary person who lives next to you ("the girl/boy next-door")
   
   **Synonyms**: neighbouring, adjacent, immediately next to, right beside
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, faraway, across town, remote
   
   **When to Use**: Use "next-door" before a noun when you refer to the person or place directly next to yours ("our next-door neighbours"). In expressions like "boy next-door", it suggests someone relatable and ordinary.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not used after a verb (*"the neighbour is next-door" sounds incomplete; say "lives next door"). Avoid in very formal writing where "adjacent" or "neighbouring" may be preferred.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - next-door neighbour
   - next-door office
   - next-door flat/apartment
   - boy/girl next-door
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (nearest) + door (entrance/building)
   
   **Etymology**: Originally a literal description of the house whose door is next to yours; extended to an adjective meaning "immediately neighbouring".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our next-door neighbours are moving out next month.
   - There's a bakery in the next-door unit right next to our shop.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The next-door premises, located immediately next to the main branch, have been leased for expansion.
   - Residents reported disturbances originating from the next-door property.
