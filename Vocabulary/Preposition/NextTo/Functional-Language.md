1. **Functional Expression**: Could I sit next to you? (function: requesting seating position politely)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request to take a seat in the place immediately beside someone
   - *Formality*: neutral to polite
   - *Directness*: indirect (question form softens the request)
   
   **Synonyms**: Do you mind if I sit next to you?, Is it okay if I sit next to you?, Can I sit beside you?, May I sit here next to you?
   
   **Antonyms**: Please don't sit next to me, This seat is taken, I'd rather sit alone
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to join someone and sit in the seat directly next to them—on public transport, in a classroom, at a meeting, or at an event. The modal "could" makes the request feel considerate and less pushy.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal contexts where a more distant seat is expected (e.g. sitting next to senior executives without invitation). Avoid when the other person clearly wants privacy (headphones on, body turned away).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Do you mind if I sit next to you?
   - Is anyone sitting next to you?
   - Is this seat next to you free?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Indirect request that attends to the other person's negative face (desire not to be imposed on). Often accompanied by softeners like "excuse me" and a friendly tone or smile.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Sure, go ahead / Of course / Not at all (accepting)
   - Sorry, I'm saving this seat / Actually, someone's sitting here (refusing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Excuse me, could I sit next to you? There's nowhere else free.
   - Hey, is it okay if I sit next to you for this session?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - May I sit next to you, or would you prefer some space?
   - If no one has reserved this chair, could I sit next to you for the presentation?

1. **Functional Expression**: It's right next to [landmark]. (function: giving directions / locating)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to describe the location of a place as being immediately beside a known landmark
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct statement of location
   
   **Synonyms**: It's beside [landmark], It's just next to [landmark], It's immediately next to [landmark], It's right by [landmark]
   
   **Antonyms**: It's far from [landmark], It's nowhere near [landmark]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when giving simple, visual directions based on something easy to spot ("the shop is right next to the bank"). Very common in spoken English and in informal written guides.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In highly technical directions that require precise addresses or coordinates; in that case, add street names or numbers. Avoid if the two places are close but not actually side by side; "near" or "around the corner from" fits better.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - It's right next to the station/bank/exit.
   - The entrance is just next to the car park.
   - Our office is next to the main reception.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses a shared reference point to reduce cognitive load for the listener. The intensifier "right" reassures them that they will not have to search once they find the landmark.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Great, thanks—that's easy to find.
   - Okay, so it's right next to the pharmacy, got it.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Where's the coffee shop? — It's right next to the bookstore on the corner.
   - Our building's entrance is next to the big glass bank.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The conference room is located next to the main reception desk on the second floor.
   - Visitor parking is right next to the south entrance of the building.

1. **Functional Expression**: Please don't stand right next to the door. (function: polite instruction/warning)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request telling someone not to stand in the space immediately beside a door, usually for safety or access reasons
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: mitigated directive ("please" softens the command)
   
   **Synonyms**: Please move away from the door, Could you step away from the door?, Don't block the door, Please don't stand so close to the door
   
   **Antonyms**: Please wait next to the door, Stand right next to the door until your name is called
   
   **When to Use**: Use in queues, on public transport, or in crowded rooms when someone is blocking a doorway by standing right next to it. Common for safety announcements and day-to-day crowd management.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid a blunt tone that may sound scolding; in some contexts, a softer version ("Would you mind stepping away from the door?") is more appropriate. Do not use with aggressive body language; it should be a polite safety reminder.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Please don't stand so close to the door.
   - Could you not stand right next to the door?
   - Please keep the area next to the door clear.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Combines clear directive content with politeness markers ("please", "could you"). It protects negative face (right not to be ordered around) while still managing safety and access.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, sorry—I'll move. / My bad, I'll step back.
   - Sure, no problem.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Guys, please don't stand right next to the door; people need to get off.
   - Could you not wait right next to the door? It's hard to open it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - For your safety, please do not stand right next to the doors while the train is moving.
   - Passengers are requested not to stand directly next to the emergency exits.
