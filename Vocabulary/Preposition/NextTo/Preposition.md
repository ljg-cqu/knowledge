1. **Preposition**: next to (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* immediately beside someone or something; sharing a side or with almost no gap between them
   - *(Temporal)* *(rare)* immediately before or after something in an ordered list of events or items
   - *(Abstract)* almost; very close to a particular degree, quantity, or state (for example, "next to nothing", "next to impossible")
   
   **Synonyms**: beside, by, adjacent to, alongside, close to
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, away from, distant from, separate from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "next to" when you want to emphasise very close spatial position (two chairs touching, houses sharing a wall), or when you want to say that something is almost equal to another thing on a scale ("next to useless"). It works in both spoken and written English and is natural in everyday, business, and academic settings.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "next to" when the relationship is inclusion ("in" a box, "inside" a building) or exact position ("at" the door, "on" the table). Avoid it when you need a precise measure of distance ("three metres from" is better) or when the meaning is emotional closeness ("close to" someone is more natural than "next to" for relationships).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: next to the door, next to the station, next to my desk, next to the last page
   - **Verb + prep**: sit next to, stand next to, live next to, park next to, put/leave something next to
   - **Adjective + prep**: right next to, directly next to, immediately next to
   - **Noun + prep**: seat next to, house next to, office next to, building next to
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (from "nearest" or "following") + to (preposition marking direction or relation)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēhst" (nearest, superlative of "nēah" meaning near) developed into "next". Combined with "to" it formed the phrasal preposition "next to", first used for literal adjacency and later extended metaphorically to degree ("next to nothing").
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you sit next to me so we can share the screen?
   - There's a great little café next to my office.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The new research facility is located next to the main library building.
   - On the chart, the control group is plotted next to the experimental group for ease of comparison.

1. **Preposition**: right next to (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* immediately beside something with no noticeable gap; directly adjacent
   - *(Abstract)* emphatic form of "next to" meaning "almost exactly" or "as good as"
   
   **Synonyms**: immediately next to, directly beside, hard up against, pressed against
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, removed from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "right next to" when you want to stress that two things are touching or as close as they can reasonably be ("The printer is right next to my desk"). It is also common in spoken English to emphasise how close one thing is to another in quality or importance ("This plan is right next to perfect").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing where simple "next to" or "adjacent to" sound more appropriate. Do not overuse it as a general intensifier; it should describe genuine immediate adjacency or very strong similarity.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: right next to the exit, right next to the window, right next to the main road
   - **Verb + prep**: stand right next to, park right next to, put it right next to
   - **Adjective + prep**: located right next to, positioned right next to
   - **Noun + prep**: room right next to, table right next to
   
   **Root Analysis**: right (adverb meaning "exactly" or "directly") + next (nearest) + to (preposition of relation)
   
   **Etymology**: "Right" has long been used as an adverb meaning "exactly" ("right here", "right now"). Combined with "next to", it formed an emphatic collocation for zero-gap adjacency, especially common in spoken English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was standing right next to her and still couldn't hear what she said.
   - There's a convenience store right next to the station.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The emergency exit is located right next to the central staircase for rapid evacuation.
   - The control samples were stored right next to the treated samples under identical conditions.
