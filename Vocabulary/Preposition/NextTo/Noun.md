1. **Noun**: adjacency (U/C, pl: adjacencies)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The state of being next to or very close to something; direct spatial contact or neighbourhood
   - In technical fields, the relationship between two objects or units that share a boundary or are immediately next to each other
   
   **Synonyms**: proximity, contiguity, nearness, juxtaposition, side-by-sideness
   
   **Antonyms**: separation, distance, remoteness, isolation
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjacency" in technical, architectural, design, and mathematical contexts when you need a precise noun for things that are next to each other (rooms, nodes, cells, regions). It is more formal than "being next to" and works well in diagrams, reports, and specifications.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for most everyday conversation; say "next to" or "right beside" instead. Avoid when the relationship is more about similarity than physical position ("similarity" fits better there).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - spatial adjacency
   - room adjacency
   - adjacency matrix
   - adjacency of cells/nodes
   - functional adjacencies
   
   **Root Analysis**: adjacent (lying next to) + -cy (noun suffix forming abstract nouns)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin "adjacentia" (a lying near), via Old French into English as a technical noun describing the state of being next to something.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We don't worry about fancy terms—we just care about which rooms have good adjacency.
   - The kids' bedrooms and the bathroom should all have adjacency so they don't walk far at night.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The floor plan optimises adjacency between the laboratory and the storage area.
   - Network adjacency is encoded in the graph's adjacency matrix.

1. **Noun**: neighbour / neighbor (C, pl: neighbours / neighbors)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A person who lives next to or very close to you
   - More generally, a country, building, or place that is next to or very near another
   
   **Synonyms**: next-door resident, nearby resident, adjoining property, neighbouring country
   
   **Antonyms**: stranger, distant resident, remote region, far-off country
   
   **When to Use**: Use "neighbour" for people or places that are physically next to or very near you (your next-door neighbour, a neighbouring town). It naturally encodes the "next to" relationship and is common in everyday English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for purely abstract relationships where physical proximity is irrelevant (use "peer", "counterpart", or "partner" instead). "Next-door neighbour" is a bit redundant but very common; keep it in informal use, but "neighbour" alone is often enough in careful writing.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - next-door neighbour
   - good/bad neighbour
   - neighbouring country
   - friendly neighbours
   - be neighbours with
   
   **Root Analysis**: neigh- (near, nigh) + -bour (dweller)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēahgebūr" (nēah "near" + gebūr "dweller") → "neighbour", literally "the person dwelling next to you".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our neighbours next to us are really friendly.
   - The shop next to the station is run by my neighbour.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The university maintains strong partnerships with neighbouring institutions.
   - Relations with our immediate neighbours are a key factor in regional stability.

1. **Noun**: proximity (U)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The state of being near in space, time, or relationship; physical closeness, such as one building being next to another
   
   **Synonyms**: nearness, closeness, adjacency, vicinity, propinquity
   
   **Antonyms**: distance, remoteness, farness, separation
   
   **When to Use**: Use "proximity" in more formal contexts when you want to talk about how close two things are ("proximity to the station", "proximity to other buildings"). It often implies "close enough to matter"—for example, that something is conveniently or inconveniently next to something else.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: It is too formal and abstract for most everyday speech; say "near" or "right next to" instead. Avoid if you need to specify exact measurements ("within 50 metres" is clearer than "in close proximity").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - in close proximity to
   - in immediate proximity to
   - proximity to public transport
   - proximity effects
   
   **Root Analysis**: proxim- (nearest, next) + -ity (noun suffix forming abstract nouns)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin "proximitas" (nearness, next-ness), derived from "proximus" (nearest), which is also the source of "approximate" and "proxy".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I picked this flat because it's right next to the subway—in perfect proximity to work.
   - The café's proximity to campus means it's always full of students.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Site selection prioritised proximity to existing logistics infrastructure.
   - Proximity to high-traffic roads significantly increases retail visibility.
