1. **Expression**: next to nothing (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An extremely small amount; almost nothing in terms of quantity, value, or cost
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the order "next to nothing" is fixed; changing it sounds odd)
   
   **Synonyms**: almost nothing, hardly anything, very little, practically nothing, close to zero
   
   **Antonyms**: a great deal, a lot, plenty, a substantial amount
   
   **When to Use**: Use "next to nothing" in informal to neutral contexts to emphasise that something costs very little, that you know very little about a subject, or that there is almost no amount of something.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too informal for very formal academic or legal writing; in those contexts prefer "negligible", "minimal", or "insignificant". Avoid when you need a precise number instead of a vague impression.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - cost next to nothing
   - know next to nothing (about something)
   - have next to nothing (left)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Next to" (immediately beside) is used metaphorically for closeness on a scale: something is so close to "nothing" that it is practically the same as nothing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (nearest) + to (preposition) + nothing (zero amount)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - These tickets cost next to nothing—I got them in a sale.
   - I know next to nothing about blockchain, to be honest.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The intervention required next to nothing in additional budget.
   - Prior literature provides next to nothing on this specific subtopic.

1. **Expression**: next to impossible (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Extremely difficult; almost impossible to do or achieve, though not completely
   - *Fixedness*: strong ("next to impossible" is the standard form)
   
   **Synonyms**: nearly impossible, practically impossible, extremely difficult, highly improbable, all but impossible
   
   **Antonyms**: easy, straightforward, feasible, readily achievable
   
   **When to Use**: Use "next to impossible" when you want to stress that something is very, very hard but theoretically still possible. It is acceptable in spoken, written, and even many professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when something is truly impossible ("impossible" alone is clearer). In very formal writing, replace with "extremely unlikely" or "highly impracticable".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - find it next to impossible
   - make it next to impossible (for someone to do something)
   - proved next to impossible
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: As with "next to nothing", "next to" is used metaphorically: the task sits right next to "impossible" on the difficulty scale.
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (nearest) + to (preposition) + impossible (cannot be done)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Getting tickets now is next to impossible.
   - It's next to impossible to find parking next to that mall on weekends.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Without additional data, drawing firm causal conclusions is next to impossible.
   - Coordinating all stakeholders on such short notice is next to impossible.

1. **Expression**: right next to (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Immediately beside; with no noticeable gap between two people or things
   - *Fixedness*: medium ("right" can be replaced by other intensifiers, but the collocation "right next to" is very common)
   
   **Synonyms**: immediately next to, directly beside, hard up against, just next to
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, some distance away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "right next to" to emphasise that something is exactly beside something else ("The bin is right next to the door"). It adds extra vividness compared with plain "next to" and is frequent in spoken English and informal writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal documents, "adjacent to" or "immediately next to" may sound more appropriate. Avoid it when there is a clear gap or separation; the phrase implies zero or near-zero distance.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - stand right next to
   - live right next to
   - be placed right next to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The adverb "right" functions as an intensifier, strengthening the basic preposition "next to" and focusing on exact adjacency.
   
   **Root Analysis**: right (exactly, directly) + next (nearest) + to (preposition of relation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There's a great bakery right next to my office.
   - She was standing right next to me in the photo.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The emergency exit is located right next to the central stairwell.
   - A reference copy is stored right next to the main console for rapid access.
