1. **Linking Word**: next to (type: connector/degree marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used figuratively to mean "almost" or "very nearly" when followed by nouns like "nothing", "impossible", "useless"
   - *Function*: Degree/approximation connector that compares something to an extreme end of a scale by placing it "next to" that extreme
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, nearly, practically, as good as, all but
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, nothing like, not at all
   
   **When to Use**: Use "next to" as a connector when you want to emphasise that something is very close in degree to another thing, especially in fixed expressions like "next to nothing" and "next to impossible". It provides a strong but still technically non-absolute statement.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not overextend it beyond established patterns; many contexts sound more natural with "almost" or "nearly". Avoid in very formal or technical writing when precise quantification is required.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause]: The cost was next to nothing.
   - [Clause]: Achieving that without help is next to impossible.
   - [Position]: mid-sentence, usually directly before the noun or adjective it modifies
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation; behaves like an adverbial phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (nearest in a sequence or on a scale) + to (preposition marking relation)
   
   **Etymology**: Literal spatial sense (immediately beside) extended metaphorically to scales of amount, difficulty, and usefulness, where something can be "right next to" zero or "right next to" impossible.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I paid next to nothing for this jacket.
   - It's next to impossible to get a seat next to the window at that café.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Without robust data, accurate prediction is next to impossible.
   - Documentation prior to 1990 is next to non-existent.

1. **Linking Word**: bordering on (type: phrasal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Very close to a particular quality, often negative or extreme ("bordering on rude", "bordering on chaos")
   - *Function*: Degree connector that frames a state as standing next to another, stronger state on a scale
   
   **Synonyms**: verging on, close to, almost, on the edge of, nearing
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, safely away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "bordering on" to describe behaviour, qualities, or situations that are almost but not quite at an extreme ("bordering on unethical"). It often carries a warning or mild criticism.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in neutral descriptions where there is no evaluative meaning; in those cases, "almost" or "nearly" is clearer. Be cautious in sensitive contexts; it can sound accusatory.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause]: His comment was bordering on offensive.
   - [Clause]: The situation is bordering on chaos.
   - [Structure]: [be] bordering on + [noun/adjective]
   
   **Root Analysis**: border (edge, boundary) + -ing (forming participle) + on (preposition marking what lies next to the boundary)
   
   **Etymology**: From the idea of two regions sharing a border; metaphorically, one quality stands next to another at the boundary between them.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Your room is bordering on a disaster zone right now.
   - The noise next door is bordering on unbearable.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Such claims are bordering on misleading and require clarification.
   - Operational costs are bordering on unsustainable levels for small providers.

1. **Linking Word**: on the verge of (type: phrasal preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Very close to doing or experiencing something; about to reach a particular state
   - *Function*: Temporal/degree connector that places the subject right at the edge, next to a new state
   
   **Synonyms**: about to, close to, on the brink of, nearly, just before
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, safely away from, unlikely to
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on the verge of" before gerunds or nouns when something is almost happening or changing ("on the verge of tears", "on the verge of collapse"). It suits both spoken and written English and works in technical, emotional, and everyday contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: May sound overly dramatic for small or routine events. Avoid when timing is uncertain or change is only a remote possibility; "might" or "could" is more accurate then.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause]: She was on the verge of tears.
   - [Clause]: The system is on the verge of failure.
   - [Structure]: [be] on the verge of + [gerund/noun]
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (position) + the verge (edge or border) + of (preposition introducing the approaching state)
   
   **Etymology**: "Verge" comes from Latin "virga" (rod/line), later meaning an edge or boundary. The phrase pictures someone standing next to the edge of a new state.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm on the verge of falling asleep; let's wrap this up.
   - The kids are on the verge of fighting—let's separate them.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The ecosystem is on the verge of irreversible damage.
   - The organisation is on the verge of securing funding for the project.
