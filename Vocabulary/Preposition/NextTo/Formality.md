1. **Original Expression**: Could I sit next to you?  
   **Context**: Polite request to occupy the seat immediately beside someone
   
   **Core Intent**: To ask permission to sit in the place next to the listener without sounding pushy
   
   **Casual**: Can I sit next to you?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "can" instead of "could"; contraction, friendly tone, direct but not rude  
   *Use when*: Talking to friends, classmates, or colleagues you already know; informal settings like cafés, classrooms, or events
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Could I sit next to you?  
   *Characteristics*: Modal "could" softens the request; complete question, neutral and polite  
   *Use when*: Speaking to strangers on public transport, at conferences, or in workshops; situations where basic politeness is expected
   
   **Formal**: May I take this seat next to you?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "may" for permission, more elaborate phrasing ("take this seat"), respectful tone  
   *Use when*: Addressing seniors, clients, or guests; formal events, ceremonies, or interviews
   
   **Humorous**: Is this the VIP seat next to you, or can anyone sit here?  
   *Characteristics*: Light teasing, playful exaggeration ("VIP seat"), invites a smile  
   *Use when*: With friends or friendly colleagues; relaxed situations where humour is welcome  
   *Avoid when*: Power distance is high or the other person seems uncomfortable
   
   **Lively**: Mind if I squeeze in next to you?  
   *Characteristics*: Energetic verb ("squeeze in"), vivid image of a tight space, upbeat tone  
   *Use when*: Casual gatherings, crowded events, team activities where space is limited
   
   **Empathetic**: Would it be alright if I sit next to you, or would you prefer some space?  
   *Characteristics*: Offers a choice, acknowledges need for personal space, very face-sensitive  
   *Use when*: With someone who looks tired, anxious, or upset; in sensitive settings (hospitals, exams)
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With seniors or clients, prefer "May I take this seat next to you?"; peers allow "Could I sit next to you?" or "Can I sit next to you?"  
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers require more careful, semi-formal phrasing; close friends can use playful or lively variants  
   - *Gravity of Situation*: In serious or stressful settings, avoid humour; choose semi-formal or empathetic versions  
   - *Cultural Context*: In some cultures, sitting next to someone can feel intrusive—giving an option ("or would you prefer some space?") shows high sensitivity  
   - *Medium*: Spoken requests can be softer with intonation and body language; written instructions (e.g., exam rules) should avoid second person and use neutral impersonal style
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Jumping straight to "I'll just sit next to you" without asking—can feel presumptuous  
   - Using humorous variants with strangers who may not share your sense of humour  
   - Ignoring non-verbal signals that the person does not want someone next to them
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Norms for personal space vary widely. In some cultures, sitting very close or directly next to strangers is normal; in others, it is reserved for people who know each other well.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Crowded bus, stranger with open seat → **Appropriate Variant**: "Could I sit next to you?" (semi-formal)
   - **Situation 2**: Entering a formal meeting late → **Appropriate Variant**: "May I take this seat next to you?" (formal)
   - **Situation 3**: Friend looks exhausted → **Appropriate Variant**: "Would it be alright if I sit next to you, or would you prefer some space?" (empathetic)

1. **Original Expression**: It's right next to [landmark].  
   **Context**: Pointing out a location using something familiar and visible as a reference
   
   **Core Intent**: To help someone find a place quickly by explaining that it is immediately beside a well-known landmark
   
   **Casual**: It's right next to the [landmark].  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "right" as an intensifier, contractions in surrounding talk, everyday vocabulary  
   *Use when*: Giving directions to friends, tourists, or colleagues in informal conversation
   
   **Semi-Formal**: It's located next to the [landmark].  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "located" to sound slightly more professional; removes the intensifier but keeps the clear spatial relation  
   *Use when*: Workplace explanations, reception desks, email directions, information desks
   
   **Formal**: The entrance is immediately adjacent to the [landmark].  
   *Characteristics*: Uses formal collocations ("immediately adjacent"), precise description, no contractions  
   *Use when*: Writing guides, manuals, official notices, academic or technical descriptions
   
   **Humorous**: You can't miss it—it's glued right next to the [landmark].  
   *Characteristics*: Exaggeration ("glued"), playful reassurance, hyperbole  
   *Use when*: Relaxed contexts, friendly explanations where humour reduces anxiety about getting lost  
   *Avoid when*: Giving safety-critical directions or speaking very formally
   
   **Lively**: It's literally right next to the [landmark]—as soon as you see that, you're there.  
   *Characteristics*: Emphatic adverbs ("literally"), reassuring tone, focus on ease  
   *Use when*: Encouraging someone who worries about directions; informal presentations or tours
   
   **Empathetic**: To make it easier, just look for the [landmark]; we're right next to it.  
   *Characteristics*: Supportive framing ("to make it easier"), step-by-step reassurance  
   *Use when*: Helping someone who is anxious, new to the area, or navigating in a second language
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Customer-facing roles can safely use semi-formal "It's located next to..."; internal reports may prefer "immediately adjacent to"  
   - *Social Distance*: For strangers, start with neutral/semi-formal; for friends, casual and humorous options are fine  
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Emergency or safety signage should use clear, formal language ("immediately adjacent to the emergency exit")  
   - *Cultural Context*: In areas with complex layouts, people rely heavily on landmarks; explicit "right next to" often feels more helpful than street numbers alone  
   - *Medium*: Spoken directions can rely on gesture; written directions must be unambiguous and may pair landmark + address
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "right next to" when there are several buildings in between—creates confusion and distrust  
   - Relying only on landmarks that outsiders may not recognise  
   - Using informal exaggerations ("you can't miss it") in formal documents
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many cities, locals navigate primarily by landmarks, so "next to the big supermarket" is more effective than a full postal address. In some administrative contexts, only official addresses are accepted, so both may be needed.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Phone call with a visitor → **Appropriate Variant**: "It's located next to the main station." (semi-formal)
   - **Situation 2**: Tourist asking you in the street → **Appropriate Variant**: "Don't worry, it's right next to the museum." (casual/empathetic)
   - **Situation 3**: Safety guide for a building → **Appropriate Variant**: "The assembly point is immediately adjacent to the main gate." (formal)
