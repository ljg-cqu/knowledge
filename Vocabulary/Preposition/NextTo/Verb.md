1. **Verb**: adjoin (T)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To be next to or share a border with another place, building, or piece of land
   - To touch or be directly connected with something
   
   **Synonyms**: border, abut, touch, join, lie next to
   
   **Antonyms**: be separated from, stand apart from, be distant from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjoin" in formal or technical descriptions of space (architecture, geography, planning) when one area, room, or property is directly next to another and usually shares a boundary or wall.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual talk ("next to" or "right next to" is more natural in conversation). Do not use for loose, non-touching proximity; "near" fits better when there is a gap.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - rooms that adjoin each other
   - a garden adjoining the house
   - properties that adjoin the park
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to, toward) + join (connect, link)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French "ajoinre" and Latin "adjungere" (to join to), originally meaning to fasten or connect and now strongly associated with things being next to each other.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our kitchen adjoins the living room, so it feels like one big space.
   - There's a small café adjoining the bookstore next to campus.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The laboratory adjoins a storage facility located next to the service corridor.
   - Several residential blocks adjoin the green belt that runs next to the river.

1. **Verb**: border (T/I)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To form an edge along something; to be next to another country, region, or area
   - To be very close to a particular quality or state (often in negative or extreme expressions)
   
   **Synonyms**: edge, bound, adjoin, be next to, be contiguous with
   
   **Antonyms**: be far from, be remote from, lie away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "border" when describing lands, regions, or areas that are next to each other and share a boundary ("the town borders the lake"). In figurative use, it expresses that something is almost another thing ("bordering on rude").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for small everyday objects ("the mug borders the plate" sounds odd; "is next to" is better). Be careful with figurative use in sensitive contexts, as it can sound strongly critical.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - border on
   - border something
   - a park bordering the river
   - bordering on chaos / madness / genius
   
   **Root Analysis**: border (edge, boundary) from Old French "bordure" + verb use by functional shift
   
   **Etymology**: Originally a noun meaning an edge or hem; later used as a verb meaning "to provide with a border" and then "to lie next to, sharing a boundary".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our backyard borders the field next to the school.
   - His behaviour was bordering on rude.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study area borders a protected wetland immediately next to the river.
   - The proposal is bordering on impractical given the current constraints.

1. **Verb**: flank (T)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To be positioned on one or both sides of something; to stand next to it and frame it
   - To guard or support something from the sides
   
   **Synonyms**: line, edge, border, stand next to, be on either side of
   
   **Antonyms**: leave isolated, stand apart from, be away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "flank" when describing things arranged next to something in a way that highlights the sides ("trees flank the path", "two guards flank the entrance"). It suggests deliberate arrangement and visual framing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not appropriate for random or casual "next to" situations ("my bag flanks your chair" sounds odd). Avoid in very informal speech where "stand next to" or "be on either side of" is clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - flank the entrance
   - trees flanking the road
   - be flanked by
   - flanked on both sides by
   
   **Root Analysis**: flank (side of a person, animal, or structure) used as a verb
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French "flanc" (side) → English noun "flank" → verb meaning "stand at the side of, be positioned next to".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Two tall plants flank the sofa next to the window.
   - The stage was flanked by speakers on both sides.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
