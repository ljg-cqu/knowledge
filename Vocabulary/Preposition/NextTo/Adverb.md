1. **Adverb**: side by side (type: place/manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a position where two or more people or things are directly next to each other, facing the same way
   - In a cooperative or parallel way, working closely together
   
   **Synonyms**: next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, alongside, together, in parallel
   
   **Antonyms**: apart, separately, far apart, at a distance
   
   **When to Use**: Use "side by side" when you want to emphasise that things are positioned right next to each other ("The chairs are side by side") or that people are working very closely together ("They worked side by side on the project").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for things that are above/below rather than next to each other; "on top of" or "under" are clearer. Do not confuse with "one after another", which expresses sequence rather than adjacency.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stand side by side
   - sit side by side
   - work side by side
   - side by side comparison
   
   **Root Analysis**: side (lateral surface) + by (near, next to) + side (repeated for emphasis)
   
   **Etymology**: Reduplicated phrase highlighting two sides placed next to each other; widely used to express literal and figurative closeness.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We sat side by side on the sofa next to the window.
   - The two shops stand side by side on the street.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The results are presented side by side to allow direct comparison.
   - Two adjacent plots are displayed side by side in the figure.

1. **Adverb**: closely (type: degree/place)
   **Meaning**: 
   - With little space in between; in a way that keeps things very near or next to each other
   - In a careful or detailed way (secondary meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: tightly, closely together, right next to, near, in close proximity
   
   **Antonyms**: loosely, widely, far apart, distantly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "closely" when describing objects arranged very near or next to each other ("Cars were parked closely along the street") or people standing together ("standing closely next to each other"). It also frequently collocates with "together" ("closely together").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not rely on "closely" alone if you need to emphasise exact spatial arrangement; adding "next to" or "side by side" gives a clearer picture. Avoid confusion with the "carefully" meaning when context is about physical distance.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stand closely together
   - parked closely next to one another
   - houses built closely together
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near) + -ly (adverbial suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French "clos" (closed, confined), giving the English adjective "close" and adverb "closely" for both physical and metaphorical nearness.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The tables are set so closely that people sit right next to strangers.
   - We stood closely next to the stage to get a better view.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Residential units are positioned closely next to shared facilities.
   - The components are mounted closely on the board to minimise wiring distance.

1. **Adverb**: directly (type: place/manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a straight line or manner without anything in between; immediately
   - Frequently used before "next to" or similar expressions to emphasise zero-gap adjacency
   
   **Synonyms**: immediately, straight, right, straightaway (spatial or temporal), exactly
   
   **Antonyms**: indirectly, obliquely, loosely, vaguely
   
   **When to Use**: Use "directly" when you want to stress that something is exactly in a position with nothing between ("directly next to the door") or immediately afterwards in time. With "next to", it highlights literal side-by-side position.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "directly" where there is a clear gap or something in between; it would be misleading. Avoid overusing it as a mere emphasis filler.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - directly next to
   - directly beside
   - directly opposite (contrast position, not adjacency)
   - directly in front of
   
   **Root Analysis**: direct (straight, without deviation) + -ly (adverbial suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin "directus" (straight) via Old French; adverb "directly" developed to mean both "in a straight line" and "immediately".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I found a parking space directly next to the entrance.
   - She was sitting directly next to me on the bus.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The emergency exit is directly next to the main staircase.
   - The two variables are displayed directly next to each other in the table.
