   **Antonyms**: against, opposed to, in opposition to, anti
   
   **When to Use**: In formal and semi-formal contexts when expressing support, approval, or preference; appropriate for debates, discussions, voting, and position statements

   **Why This Partnership**:

   - Historical legal and parliamentary usage established this fixed phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin favor "goodwill, support" → in (preposition of state) + favor + of (preposition linking to object)

   - come out strongly in favor of (intensified)
   - publicly come out in favor of (redundant but emphatic)
   - finally come out in favor of (emphasizing timing)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Come out" (emerge, declare publicly) + "in favor of" creates expression specifically about public declaration; "come out" implies revealing previously hidden or uncertain position
   
   **Root Analysis**: come out (phrasal verb: emerge publicly) + in favor of (prepositional phrase: supporting)
