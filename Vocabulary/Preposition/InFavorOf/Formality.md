   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher status or formal authority requires "I am in favor of" or "I support"; equals allow "I'm all for"
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers/new colleagues require formal; established relationships allow casual
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Major decisions (budgets, layoffs, restructuring) require formal; routine matters allow casual
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect formal register by default regardless of relationship
   - *Medium*: Written formal documents require "I am in favor of"; spoken team chats allow casual forms
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "I'm all for it" in a board presentation—sounds too casual and may undermine credibility
   - Saying "I am in favor of" to close friends—sounds stiff and creates unnecessary social distance
   - Using humor when others are seriously concerned—can appear dismissive or insensitive
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In hierarchical cultures (e.g., East Asian, Middle Eastern), formal register is expected regardless of the speaker's position. In egalitarian cultures (e.g., Scandinavian, Australian), casual forms are acceptable even with leadership.

   - **Situation 1**: Board meeting discussing $10M investment → **Appropriate Variant**: "I am in favor of this proposal" (formal setting, high stakes, senior audience)

   - **Situation 3**: Email to department head about policy change → **Appropriate Variant**: "I support this proposal" (semi-formal writing, moderate power distance)
