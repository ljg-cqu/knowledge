# Preposition: From - Comprehensive Analysis

1. **Preposition**: from (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Indicating the starting point or origin of movement, distance, or position
   - *(Temporal)* Indicating the starting point in time of an action or state
   - *(Abstract)* Indicating the source, cause, origin, or basis of something
   
   **Synonyms**: out of (in context of origin), starting at (in temporal context), originating in (in source context)
   
   **Antonyms**: to, toward, into, until
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing origin, source, starting point, separation, distance, derivation, cause, material composition, distinction, or protection
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using "from" when expressing destination (use "to"), arrival (use "at"), or inclusion (use "in"); common learner error is L1 interference from languages that use different prepositions for source/origin
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: from home, from scratch, from experience, from time to time, from now on
   - **Verb + prep**: come from, derive from, differ from, range from, result from, suffer from, benefit from, protect from, prevent from, refrain from, distinguish from
   - **Adjective + prep**: different from, far from, absent from, free from, safe from
   - **Noun + prep**: distance from, departure from, origin from, transition from, escape from
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "fram" (forward, from)

   **When to Use**: Expressing ranges (quantities, times, distances), transitions, transformations, or comprehensive scope
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when expressing single point in time/space; common error is omitting "to" in the correlative structure
