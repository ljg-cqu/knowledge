# Linking Words & Discourse Markers with "From"

1. **Linking Word**: from...to (type: correlative connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate range, span, transition, or progression between two points (spatial, temporal, or abstract)
   - *Function*: Creates logical relationship of scope, range, or transformation
   
   **Synonyms**: between...and, ranging from...to, spanning...from...to
   
   **Antonyms**: within (single point), at (specific location)
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing ranges of values, time spans, spatial distances, or transitions between states; formal and informal academic writing, data presentation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when expressing single point or when endpoints are unclear; cannot be used for three or more points (use "from X to Y to Z" or "from X through Y to Z")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + [verb] + from [starting point] to [ending point]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence (after verb), follows element being described
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation needed; correlative pair
   - [Common errors to avoid]: omitting "to" in the pair, reversing order (to...from is incorrect)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Correlative structure combining prepositions
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "fram" (from) paired with "tō" (to) forming correlative structure for indicating span
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The store is open from 9 to 5 every day.
   - We drove from New York to Boston in about four hours.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The analysis encompasses data from 2010 to 2023.
   - Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 65 years.

2. **Linking Word**: from this/that perspective (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a viewpoint or angle from which to consider information
   - *Function*: Shifts discourse to mark perspective, framing, or interpretive stance
   
   **Synonyms**: from this viewpoint, from this angle, in this light, considering this aspect, viewed this way
   
   **Antonyms**: from another perspective, alternatively, on the other hand
   
   **When to Use**: Academic and formal writing when introducing analytical perspective or interpretive framework; helps structure argument
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be wordy in casual speech; informal contexts prefer simpler constructions
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: From this perspective, [independent clause explaining viewpoint]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial position (most common), can be mid-sentence after subject
   - [Punctuation]: comma after the phrase when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overuse within single paragraph; ensure clear antecedent for "this/that"
   
   **Root Analysis**: "from" + demonstrative + abstract noun "perspective"
   
   **Etymology**: "perspective" from Latin "perspectivus" (optical) + "from" creates discourse marking function
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - From my perspective, the whole thing was a waste of time.
   - From that perspective, yeah, I guess you're right.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - From this perspective, the policy represents a significant departure from precedent.

   **Synonyms**: from the beginning, from the start, initially, at first, right away, from the get-go
   
   **Antonyms**: eventually, ultimately, in the end, finally
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing that conditions, intentions, or situations existed from the very beginning; narrative and analytical contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Redundant with other temporal markers; "from the get-go" is very informal
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: From the outset, [subject] + [verb] / [Subject] + [verb] + from the outset
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: comma after phrase when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: mixing informal and formal variants inappropriately
   
   **Root Analysis**: "from" + "the outset/start" (beginning point)
   
   **Etymology**: "outset" (beginning of journey) + "from" creates temporal marker
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I knew from the start this wasn't going to work.
   - From the outset, we were clear about what we wanted.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - [Clause structure]: Judging from [evidence], [conclusion/inference]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial position
   - [Punctuation]: comma after the phrase
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using without clear evidence; making unsupported claims

   **Antonyms**: resulting in, leading to, causing (forward causation)
