   **Synonyms**: following, when, once, subsequent to, upon
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, until, preceding
   
   **When to Use**: Establishing temporal relationships between events; showing sequence; both formal and informal writing; narrative and procedural contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid ambiguity between "after" (time) and "afterward" (adverb); don't create comma splices; ensure temporal relationship is clear
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [main clause] + after + [time clause with subject + verb]
   - **Position**: Mid-sentence typical; sentence-initial for emphasis (requires comma)
   - **Punctuation**: No comma when "after" clause follows main clause; comma when "after" clause precedes main clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Comma splice (*"We ate dinner, after we went home"); mixing up "after" and "afterward"
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "æfter" (following in place or time, behind)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Independent sentence]. Afterwards, [independent sentence].
   - **Position**: Sentence-initial (most common), mid-sentence, or sentence-final
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after sentence-initial "afterwards"; no punctuation in mid/end position
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using as subordinating conjunction (*"We ate afterwards we left"); double time marking (*"After that, afterwards")
   
   **Root Analysis**: after + -ward(s) (directional suffix)

   - **Clause structure**: [Independent sentence]. Subsequently, [independent sentence].
   - **Position**: Sentence-initial (most common) or mid-sentence; rarely end position
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after sentence-initial "subsequently"; set off with commas in mid-position
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Overuse in informal contexts; using without clear prior reference point
   
   **Root Analysis**: sub- (under, after) + sequ (follow) + -ent + -ly

   - **Position**: Very flexible—beginning, middle, or end of clause
   - **Punctuation**: Comma when "then" starts new sentence; part of "and then" coordination; can be mid-sentence without commas
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Comma splice (*"We ate, then we left"—needs "and then" or separate sentences)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English demonstrative/temporal adverb

   - **Position**: Sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after sentence-initial "once" clause; no comma when "once" clause follows main clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing temporal "once" with frequency "once" (*"Once I went there" could mean "I went there one time")
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "ānes" (genitive of "ān" = one) → "at one time"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "ānes" (of one, once) → developed temporal meaning of "at one time" → "as soon as"

   - **Punctuation**: Comma when "since" clause precedes main clause; no comma when following
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using simple past instead of present perfect (*"I live here since 2020"—should be "I have lived"); ambiguous temporal vs. causal meaning
   
   **Root Analysis**: Middle English contraction of "sithence" → Old English "siþþan" (after that)
