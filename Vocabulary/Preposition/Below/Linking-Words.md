1. **Linking Word**: as indicated below / as shown below (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A transitional phrase that directs the reader to subsequent information in a text, creating cohesion between sections
   - Signals that evidence, examples, or detailed information will follow in a lower section of the document
   - *Function*: Cohesive reference device; organizes discourse by establishing forward-pointing references
   
   **Synonyms**: as follows, in what follows, as demonstrated below, see below, as presented below
   
   **Antonyms**: as mentioned above, as previously stated, as shown earlier, as indicated earlier
   
   **When to Use**: In academic writing, research papers, business reports, technical documentation when organizing information hierarchically; when establishing clear internal references; when guiding readers through complex multi-section documents
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In informal conversation (overly formal), in very short documents where all content is immediately visible, when the referent is ambiguous or far removed from the reference point, in dynamic digital formats where "below" may not be spatially meaningful
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement] + [, as shown below,] / [. As indicated below, ...]
   - [Position]: Sentence-final after comma, or sentence-initial before comma
   - [Punctuation]: Always set off with commas when mid-sentence; followed by comma when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without clear referent below; overusing in same paragraph; using when content is immediately adjacent
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (comparison/manner) + indicated/shown (past participle verbs) + below (spatial adverb for text position)
   
   **Etymology**: Academic discourse convention developed in scholarly writing; "as shown below" emerged in scientific papers where figures and tables were referenced from text above them
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The schedule's changed a bit—check it out below.
   - Here's what we're planning, as shown below in the calendar.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The methodology employed three distinct phases, as indicated below in the procedural framework.
   - Participant demographics reveal significant diversity across multiple variables, as shown below in Table 2.

1. **Linking Word**: below [noun/threshold] (type: subordinating connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Establishes a relationship of insufficient quantity, quality, or position relative to a standard or reference point
   - Creates a comparative clause showing that something does not reach or exceed a benchmark
   - *Function*: Establishes hierarchical or measurement relationships between elements
   
   **Synonyms**: under [standard], beneath [level], lower than [threshold], short of [expectation]
   
   **Antonyms**: above [standard], over [threshold], beyond [level], exceeding [expectation]
   
   **When to Use**: When making quantitative comparisons, establishing standards or thresholds, describing hierarchical relationships, discussing measurement criteria in technical, academic, or professional contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "under" would be more idiomatic (under pressure, under control), when exact equality is meant rather than less-than relationship, in casual contexts where simpler constructions are clearer
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + [verb] + [below] + [noun/number]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence as prepositional phrase; typically follows the verb
   - [Punctuation]: No special punctuation required; integrated into sentence structure
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing with "under" in idiomatic expressions; using with incompatible verbs; mismatching with abstract concepts that don't have clear hierarchies
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by, about) + low (not high) → spatial preposition extended to abstract comparisons
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English bilooghe; spatial meaning extended metaphorically to quantitative and qualitative comparisons during Early Modern English period
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If your score's below 50, you'll need to retake the test.
   - Anyone below the age of 18 needs parental permission.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Samples with contamination levels below 5 ppm were deemed acceptable for commercial distribution.
   - Applicants ranking below the 75th percentile were placed in the alternative assessment pool.

1. **Linking Word**: below which / below whom (type: relative connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a relative clause that establishes a relationship of lower position, rank, or measurement
   - Functions as a relative pronoun construction indicating something is situated beneath, inferior to, or less than the antecedent
   - *Function*: Creates complex sentences with embedded hierarchical relationships
   
   **Synonyms**: beneath which, under which, lower than which, underneath which
   
   **Antonyms**: above which, over which, beyond which, higher than which
   
   **When to Use**: In formal academic or technical writing when expressing complex hierarchical relationships, legal documents establishing jurisdictional levels, scientific papers describing stratification or measurement thresholds
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In informal conversation (sounds stilted), when simpler constructions would be clearer, when the relative clause creates ambiguity about the referent, in contexts where "under which" is more idiomatic
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Noun] + [, below which] + [relative clause]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence introducing non-restrictive relative clause
   - [Punctuation]: Always preceded by comma in non-restrictive use; no comma in restrictive use (rare)
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without clear antecedent; creating overly complex nested structures; confusing with "under which" in legal/procedural contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: below (preposition) + which (relative pronoun) → compound relative connector
   
   **Etymology**: Formal construction following pattern of "above which," "beyond which"; common in scientific and legal English from 18th century onward
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There's a minimum grade, below which you can't pass the course.
   - They set a price point below which they won't sell.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The critical threshold, below which cellular function becomes impaired, was established at 2.5 mmol/L.
   - The Board established a performance baseline, below which executive compensation would be subject to forfeiture provisions.
