1. **Functional Expression**: As shown/illustrated/indicated below (function: referring/directing attention)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Directing the reader's or listener's attention to information, data, or visual content that appears subsequently in a document or at a lower position
   - *Formality*: formal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: As demonstrated below, As presented below, As follows, See below, In the following section
   
   **Antonyms**: As shown above, As previously mentioned, As stated earlier
   
   **When to Use**: In academic writing, business reports, presentations, technical documentation when referencing content that appears later; establishes clear internal document references; guides reader through structured information
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation (overly formal), when the referenced content is immediately adjacent (redundant), in contexts where visual position is unclear (digital formats without fixed layout)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - As indicated/demonstrated/presented below (more formal)
   - See below (less formal, direct)
   - Below you will find (slightly more conversational)
   - The information below shows/illustrates (emphasizes the content)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Functions as a cohesive device creating textual coherence; establishes reader expectations for forthcoming information; reduces ambiguity in complex documents with multiple sections; particularly valued in academic and professional discourse for precision
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - [Reader acknowledges and looks to referenced section]
   - [In presentations] "Thank you, I can see that now" / "Got it"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Check out the chart below—it shows the trend pretty clearly.
   - So as you can see below, the numbers tell the whole story.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - As illustrated below in Figure 3.2, the correlation coefficient demonstrates a statistically significant relationship.
   - The methodological framework, as shown below, adheres to established protocols in quantitative research design.

1. **Functional Expression**: Below [standard/expectation/level] (function: expressing inadequacy/deficiency)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicating that performance, quality, or measurements fail to meet required standards or expectations
   - Communicating that something is insufficient or substandard
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: direct (can be face-threatening)
   
   **Synonyms**: Under [standard], Beneath [expectation], Not meeting [requirement], Substandard, Inadequate
   
   **Antonyms**: Above [standard], Exceeding [expectations], Meeting requirements, Satisfactory
   
   **When to Use**: In performance reviews, quality assessments, academic evaluations, compliance reporting when objective standards exist; when providing constructive feedback requiring improvement
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In encouraging or motivational contexts (demotivating), when subjective preferences rather than objective standards apply, in situations requiring diplomatic language to preserve face
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Falls below [standard] (emphasizes the action of declining)
   - Below acceptable levels (adds severity)
   - Below our expectations (personalizes the standard)
   - Well below / Far below (intensifies the gap)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Direct expression that can threaten negative face (autonomy); often softened with hedges or empathetic framing in sensitive contexts; implies objective measurement against clear criteria; creates accountability for improvement
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "I understand, I'll work on improving that"
   - "What specific areas need improvement?"
   - "Can you clarify what the standard is?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Your attendance has been below what we agreed on—we need to talk about that.
   - The effort here is below what I know you're capable of.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Current performance metrics remain below established organizational standards, necessitating immediate remedial action.
   - The vendor's quality assurance results were consistently below contractual specifications, resulting in termination of the agreement.

1. **Functional Expression**: [Number/Temperature] below [threshold] (function: reporting measurements)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Stating that a quantifiable measurement is less than a specific value or threshold
   - Providing objective data about levels that fall beneath a reference point
   - *Formality*: neutral (technical/informational)
   - *Directness*: direct (factual statement)
   
   **Synonyms**: Under [number], Less than [value], Beneath [threshold], Lower than [point]
   
   **Antonyms**: Above [threshold], Over [number], Exceeding [value], Higher than [point]
   
   **When to Use**: In weather reports, scientific data presentation, financial reporting, technical specifications, medical results when precise numerical information is being communicated
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When approximate or qualitative descriptions are more appropriate, when the specific number is less important than the trend, when audience lacks context for the threshold's significance
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Dropping below [number] (emphasizes change)
   - Remains below [threshold] (emphasizes stability)
   - Well below / Far below [number] (emphasizes significant gap)
   - Just below / Slightly below [threshold] (minimizes gap)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Factual reporting function with minimal face threat; implies comparison to meaningful threshold or standard; often triggers associated actions or decisions based on threshold crossing; precision valued over politeness in technical contexts
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "What's the significance of that threshold?"
   - "Should we be concerned?"
   - [Taking appropriate action based on threshold meaning]
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's gonna be 10 degrees below zero tonight—bundle up!
   - My glucose reading was below 100 this morning, so that's good.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Ambient temperatures fell to 15 degrees Celsius below the optimal operational threshold, compromising system efficiency.
   - Serum cholesterol levels measured at 180 mg/dL, remaining below the elevated risk threshold of 200 mg/dL.

1. **Functional Expression**: Below the surface (function: indicating hidden complexity/depth)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Suggesting that there are deeper, hidden, or less obvious aspects to a situation beyond what is immediately apparent
   - Indicating that initial appearances may be misleading or incomplete
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: indirect (metaphorical)
   
   **Synonyms**: Beneath the surface, Under the surface, Deeper than it appears, More than meets the eye, Hidden depths
   
   **Antonyms**: On the surface, At face value, Obviously, Apparently, Superficially
   
   **When to Use**: In analytical discussions, psychological or social commentary, when encouraging deeper investigation, in storytelling or narrative contexts to build intrigue
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When literal spatial relationships are being described, in contexts requiring direct literal communication, when metaphorical language may confuse non-native speakers
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just below the surface (emphasizes proximity to discovery)
   - Far below the surface (emphasizes depth of concealment)
   - Scratch below the surface (emphasizes need for investigation)
   - What lies below the surface (question form)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Metaphorical expression drawing on spatial schema (up=visible/known, down=hidden/unknown); invites interlocutor to consider non-obvious factors; can function as hedge suggesting uncertainty about full picture; builds engagement by implying discovery
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "What do you mean exactly?"
   - "Like what, for example?"
   - "I hadn't thought about it that way"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
