1. **Expression**: below average (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Less than the typical or mean level; lower than what is considered normal or standard in a particular context
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly frequent collocation in statistics, education, assessment)
   
   **Synonyms**: subaverage, subpar, below the norm, under average, lower than typical
   
   **Antonyms**: above average, exceptional, superior, above the norm
   
   **When to Use**: In educational assessments, statistical reporting, performance evaluations, comparative analyses where measurements are compared against mean values
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing individuals directly (potentially offensive), when median rather than mean is the relevant statistic, in contexts where "below standard" or "below expectations" is more precise
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - well below average (intensifier)
   - slightly below average (minimizer)
   - consistently below average (frequency marker)
   - far below average (extreme distance)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Average" represents a statistical central tendency, and "below" naturally positions values on the lower side of this distribution; fundamental pairing in statistical and evaluative discourse; high frequency in educational and performance contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: below (lower position) + average (from French avarie via Italian/Arabic, meaning typical or mean value)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - His attendance has been below average this semester—he's missed like half the classes.
   - The restaurant got below average reviews, but I liked it anyway.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Student performance on standardized assessments was below average relative to national benchmarks.
   - The portfolio's returns were consistently below average throughout the fiscal period.

1. **Expression**: below the surface (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *Literal meaning*: Underneath the top layer of water, ground, or material
   - *Figurative/Idiomatic meaning*: Hidden from immediate view; not immediately apparent; describing deeper complexities, emotions, or issues that are not obvious at first glance
   - *Fixedness*: medium (literal use is transparent; figurative use is semi-idiomatic)
   
   **Synonyms**: beneath the surface, under the surface, deeper than appears, hidden depths, more than meets the eye, under the hood
   
   **Antonyms**: on the surface, at face value, superficially, obviously apparent
   
   **When to Use**: When analyzing situations with hidden complexity, discussing psychological or emotional states, examining organizational culture, investigating problems with non-obvious causes
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When literal spatial description is needed (ambiguous), in contexts requiring direct literal communication, with audiences unfamiliar with metaphorical English
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - just below the surface (emphasizes proximity to discovery)
   - far below the surface (emphasizes deep concealment)
   - scratch below the surface (to investigate deeper)
   - what lies below the surface (interrogative form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Derives from common human experience of water surfaces hiding underwater depths; metaphorically extended to any situation where visible aspects don't reveal full reality; conceptual metaphor: KNOWING IS SEEING, HIDDEN IS DOWN
   
   **Root Analysis**: below (spatial position) + the (definite article) + surface (top boundary layer)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everything looks fine on the team, but I think there's tension below the surface.
   - She seems happy, but below the surface she's really struggling.

1. **Expression**: below par (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *Literal meaning*: In golf, scoring fewer strokes than the standard (which is actually good in golf)
   - *Figurative/Idiomatic meaning*: Below the expected or normal standard; not as good as usual; underperforming or feeling unwell (especially British English)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiom with reversed meaning from golf origin)
   
   **Synonyms**: substandard, below standard, under the weather (for health), not up to scratch, subpar, inadequate
   
   **Antonyms**: above par, up to standard, excellent, performing well, feeling great
   
   **When to Use**: When describing performance that doesn't meet expectations, health issues (British English), quality below standards; informal performance assessments
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In actual golf contexts (causes confusion since below par is good in golf), when precise technical language is required, in very formal assessments (use "below standard" or "inadequate")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - feeling below par (health)
   - performance below par (work quality)
   - well below par (intensifier)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Originates from golf where "par" is the standard number of strokes; ironically, "below par" means better in golf but worse in general usage; the reversal occurred because "par" was adopted as meaning "standard" in non-golf contexts where below = worse
   
   **Root Analysis**: below + par (from Latin par "equal, equal value")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm feeling a bit below par today—might be coming down with something.
   - Your work's been below par lately; everything okay?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - *Typically informal; avoid in formal contexts* → Use instead: "The quality of deliverables was below established standards."

   **Synonyms**: unfair, hitting below the belt, a low blow, unsportsmanlike, unethical attack, cheap shot
   
   **Antonyms**: fair criticism, above board, ethical, legitimate criticism, playing fair
   
   **When to Use**: When describing unfair personal attacks, inappropriate arguments, unethical competitive tactics, criticisms that target vulnerabilities inappropriately
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In literal boxing commentary (causes confusion), in very formal contexts (use "inappropriate" or "unprofessional"), when mild disagreement is meant rather than serious unfairness
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - hit below the belt (verb form)
   - that's below the belt (judgment statement)
   - a bit below the belt (minimized criticism)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Direct borrowing from boxing rules where hitting below the belt is prohibited as dangerous and unsportsmanlike; metaphorically extended to any unfair tactic in conflicts or competitions; first known use late 19th century
   
   **Root Analysis**: below + the belt (waistline marker in boxing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Bringing up his divorce in the argument was really below the belt.

   **Antonyms**: high-profile, in the spotlight, attracting attention, on everyone's radar, visible
   
   **When to Use**: When describing activities, issues, or people that avoid detection or attention; stealth operations; problems that haven't received adequate attention; understated approaches
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When literal radar detection is being discussed (ambiguous), in contexts where "unnoticed" or "undetected" would be clearer and less metaphorical
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - fly below the radar (verb form emphasizing intention)
   - staying below the radar (continuous effort)
   - slip below the radar (accidental lack of detection)
   - remain below the radar (sustained state)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Military aviation metaphor where flying below radar detection altitude avoids being tracked; extended to any situation of avoiding detection or attention; popularized during Cold War era, now common in business, social, and political discourse
   
   **Root Analysis**: below (under threshold) + the radar (detection system acronym: RAdio Detection And Ranging)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He likes to stay below the radar—doesn't post on social media or anything.
   - The project flew below the radar until it suddenly got huge.

   **Antonyms**: rise above, climb above, exceed, surpass, increase beyond
   
   **When to Use**: In reporting quantitative changes, temperature shifts, performance declines, financial reporting, scientific measurements crossing thresholds
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For gradual trends without specific threshold (use "decline" or "decrease"), for minor fluctuations (use "fluctuate around"), for sustained low levels without change (use "remain below")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - fell below (past tense)
   - falling below (progressive)
   - has fallen below (present perfect for sustained state)
   - dropped below (sudden change emphasis)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Fall/drop" denotes downward movement, and "below" specifies the endpoint relative to a threshold; natural semantic compatibility in describing threshold-crossing events; extremely high frequency in weather, financial, and scientific reporting
   
   **Root Analysis**: fall/drop (downward movement verbs) + below (beneath threshold point)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Temperatures fell below freezing last night—my car wouldn't start.
   - His grades dropped below a C, so he lost his scholarship.
