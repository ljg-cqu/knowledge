   - *Medium*: Official written decisions must be formal; verbal updates can be more casual
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "the claim checks out" in legal decision document (too casual, lacks precision)
   - Using "requisite burden of proof" in casual team email (unnecessarily complex and formal)
   - Being too casual when announcing important determinations that affect stakeholders
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Legal tribunal issuing formal decision → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal (legal standards and precedent)
   - **Situation 2**: Team lead updating team on claim validation → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal or Casual (internal communication)
   - **Situation 3**: Customer service confirming approved claim → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic (customer satisfaction and relationship building)
