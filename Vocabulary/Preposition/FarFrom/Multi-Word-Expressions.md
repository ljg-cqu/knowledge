1. **Expression**: far from perfect (type: collocation/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to say that something has many flaws or problems; very far from being perfect or ideal.
   - *Fixedness*: medium–strong (pattern *far from + adjective* is productive, but *far from perfect* is very common and recognizable).
   
   **Synonyms**: far from ideal, very imperfect, seriously flawed, nowhere near perfect
   
   **Antonyms**: almost perfect, nearly perfect, close to perfect, impeccable
   
   **When to Use**: Use *far from perfect* to give a frank but measured negative evaluation of a plan, system, performance, or situation. It signals that reality is far from the ideal, yet may still be workable.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it when you need precise technical evaluation; give concrete metrics instead. In very formal writing, alternatives like *highly imperfect* or *contains significant shortcomings* may fit better.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - far from ideal
   - far from satisfactory
   - far from acceptable
   - far from complete
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The intensifier *far from* combines with positive adjectives like *perfect* to create a strong negative evaluation meaning "not at all" like the positive term.
   
   **Root Analysis**: far (great distance) + from (preposition) + perfect (Latin *perfectus* = completed, without defect)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The app is far from perfect, but it's good enough for now.
   - Our plan is far from perfect—we're still a long way from where we want to be.

   **Antonyms**: close to the truth, almost right, largely accurate
   
   **When to Use**: Use *far from the truth* when you want to correct a statement or impression that is very inaccurate without listing every detail. It fits both spoken and written criticism.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In highly diplomatic or formal contexts, it can sound too blunt; consider *does not reflect the reality* or *substantially misrepresents the situation* instead.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - be far from the truth
   - idea is far from the truth
   - rumor is far from the truth
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The phrase maps physical distance (*far from*) onto conceptual distance between a belief and actual facts.

   **When to Use**: Use *far from over* to warn that a problem, conflict, process, or crisis still has a long way to go ("the crisis is far from over"). It stresses temporal distance from the endpoint.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it in highly technical progress reports where specific milestones and dates are needed. Also be careful not to dramatize minor issues with this strong phrase.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - far from finished
   - far from resolved
   - far from complete
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Time is conceptualized as a path from start to finish; *far from* marks how distant the current point is from the end.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - a far cry from what was expected
   - a far cry from reality
   - a far cry from ideal conditions
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Historically, a *cry* could be a call heard over a distance; *a far cry* suggests something so distant that only a faint call might reach, metaphorically representing large difference.
   
   **Root Analysis**: far (great distance) + cry (call or shout) + from
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The hotel was a far cry from the photos on the website.

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it in purely descriptive technical writing where specific mismatches should be named (e.g. *assumption X conflicts with data Y*). Also avoid personal attacks; focus on ideas, not people.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - far from realistic
   - far removed from reality
   - completely detached from reality
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The phrase uses spatial distance (*far from*) to describe how distant mental pictures or plans are from actual conditions.
