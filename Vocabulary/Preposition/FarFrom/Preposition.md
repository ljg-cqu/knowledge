1. **Preposition**: far from (type: compound/phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* At a great distance from a place or reference point; much further away than expected or desired.
   - *(Temporal)* (Figurative) A long way in time from a particular moment or stage, often implying that something will not happen soon.
   - *(Abstract)* Very different from, or the opposite of, a particular state, quality, or expectation; not at all like something.
   
   **Synonyms**: a long way from, distant from, remote from, nowhere near, nothing like
   
   **Antonyms**: close to, near to, nearly, almost, much like
   
   **When to Use**: Use *far from* when you want to strongly emphasize distance or difference—physically ("far from the city"), temporally ("far from finished"), or abstractly ("far from ideal"). It is especially common before adjectives and nouns to mean "not at all" or "the opposite of" what follows.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use *far from* when you need an exact distance (use numbers + *from* instead), or when a neutral description of location is enough (use *near, close to, in, at*). Avoid overusing it in formal writing where a more precise verb (*differ, diverge, deviate*) might be clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: far from home, far from reality, far from the truth, far from the city, far from the coast, far from the ideal situation
   - **Verb + prep**: be far from, remain far from, seem far from, lie far from, feel far from
   - **Adjective + prep**: far from certain, far from perfect, far from satisfied, far from acceptable, far from complete
   - **Noun + prep**: distance far from something, result far from expectations, situation far from normal
   
   **Root Analysis**: far (Old English root meaning "at a great distance") + from (preposition marking source or reference point)
   
   **Etymology**: *Far* comes from Old English *feor* (at a distance), and *from* from Old English *fram* (away, from). The phrasal preposition *far from* developed by combining the degree adverb *far* with *from* to intensify separation or difference, both in literal space and in abstract meaning.

   **Examples [Formal]**:
