   *Use when*: Reports to senior stakeholders, written project documentation, risk registers.
   
   **Humorous**: We're so far from done we haven't even reached the "panic" stage yet.

   *Use when*: Close-knit teams, stress relief during crunch time, when everyone understands the joke.  
   *Avoid when*: Communicating with clients, executives, or in situations where delays are sensitive.
   
   **Lively**: We're a long way off the finish line—let's pace ourselves and push in the right direction.

   *Use when*: Rallying a team, sprint kick‑offs, stand‑ups where energy and realism are both needed.
   
   **Empathetic**: I know it feels like we’ve already done a lot, but we’re still far from done—let’s break the rest into smaller, manageable steps.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges effort (*I know it feels like*), inclusive *we*, solution focus (*smaller, manageable steps*)  
   *Use when*: Supporting a tired or frustrated team, one‑on‑ones, emotionally charged projects.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use Semi‑Formal/Formal with higher‑ups; Casual/Lively/Empathetic with peers and direct reports.
   - *Social Distance*: New or external stakeholders → Semi‑Formal/Formal; long‑term colleagues → more Casual or Empathetic.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Critical delays → Formal/Empathetic; manageable delays → Semi‑Formal/Lively.
   - *Cultural Context*: Hierarchical or risk‑averse cultures favor careful Formal phrasing; flatter cultures tolerate more Lively/Casual honesty.
   - *Medium*: Written reports → Formal; chat tools → Casual/Lively/Empathetic.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Softening too much ("we’re almost there") when you are actually far from done → leads to unrealistic expectations.
   - Using humorous language in front of anxious stakeholders → can seem to ignore the seriousness of the delay.
   - Being blunt without support ("we're nowhere"), which may demotivate instead of clarifying.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some East Asian and Northern European contexts, understatement is preferred; saying *far from done* may be perceived as very strong. In North American agile teams, direct expressions about being *far from done* are common and often appreciated if paired with a concrete plan.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Daily stand‑up with peers → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal or Lively (clear, honest, motivating).
   - **Situation 2**: Email to senior leadership → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal (high signal, low drama, specific about extra effort).
   - **Situation 3**: 1:1 with stressed teammate → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic (validates effort and offers structure).

   **Context**: Evaluating a solution, situation, or decision that is workable but significantly below expectations.
   
   **Core Intent**: Deliver a clear negative assessment while leaving room for improvement and discussion.
   
   **Casual**: This setup is really not ideal—it’s kind of a mess.  
   *Characteristics*: Colloquial *really not ideal*, phrase *kind of a mess*, direct emotional evaluation  
   *Use when*: Talking with friends or close teammates, low-stakes settings.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: This arrangement is far from ideal and will likely cause ongoing friction.  
   *Characteristics*: Specific noun *arrangement*, consequence *ongoing friction*, balanced between polite and frank  
   *Use when*: Internal meetings, design reviews, retrospectives.
   
   **Formal**: The current configuration is far from ideal and falls short of the stated requirements.  
   *Characteristics*: Objective tone, references *stated requirements*, clear gap between reality and criteria  
   *Use when*: Written assessments, decision memos, formal feedback.
   
   **Humorous**: Let’s just say this is…far from ideal and leave it at that.  
   *Characteristics*: Ellipsis for comic effect, indirectness, shared-understanding tone  
   *Use when*: Teams with strong rapport, when everyone already sees the problem.  
   *Avoid when*: With people who might not understand the irony or who need concrete details.
   
   **Lively**: This is far from ideal, but it gives us a clear starting point to build something much better.  
   *Characteristics*: Honest assessment followed by upbeat spin, focuses on opportunity to improve  
   *Use when*: Workshops, brainstorming, early-stage reviews where you want energy and realism.

   *Use when*: Communicating difficult compromises, change management, leadership updates.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: The more power imbalance, the more you should move toward Semi‑Formal/Formal and away from sarcasm.
   - *Social Distance*: With clients or external partners, avoid Humorous variants unless rapport is very strong.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Serious harm or risk → Formal/Empathetic; minor inconvenience → Casual/Lively.
   - *Cultural Context*: In cultures that avoid open criticism, phrase as *"does not fully meet our needs"* rather than *"far from ideal"*.
   - *Medium*: Written evaluations benefit from Semi‑Formal/Formal to leave a clear record.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using strong negative language without proposing next steps.
   - Sounding dismissive of people’s prior effort by focusing only on how far from ideal things are.
   - Using humor that minimizes real pain or cost for others.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Some cultures interpret *"far from ideal"* as very strong criticism bordering on rejection. In multicultural teams, consider softening with hedging (*"not yet ideal"*) plus constructive suggestions.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal design critique → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal or Lively.
   - **Situation 2**: Note to external partner about deliverable quality → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal.

   **Humorous**: Consider me…far from convinced—and that’s me being generous.  
   *Characteristics*: Dramatic pause, playful exaggeration, hints at skepticism through humor  
   *Use when*: Safe, trusting teams where irony is understood and welcomed.
   
   **Lively**: I’m far from convinced right now, but if we can tighten the data and clarify the risks, I’m open to changing my mind.  
   *Characteristics*: Strong initial stance plus explicit openness to persuasion, action-focused  
   *Use when*: Collaborative decision-making where you want better arguments, not a fight.
   
   **Empathetic**: I can see the effort that went into this, but I’m still far from convinced—could we walk through the key assumptions together?

   *Use when*: Giving feedback to juniors, peers, or anyone who may feel personally judged.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With juniors, prefer Empathetic to avoid shutting them down; with seniors, Semi‑Formal/Formal to keep the focus on evidence.
   - *Social Distance*: The less you know someone, the more careful you should be—avoid sarcasm and very blunt Casual forms.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: High‑impact decisions call for Formal clarity; lower-stakes brainstorming tolerates Lively or Semi‑Formal.
   - *Cultural Context*: In some cultures, direct statements of doubt are softened via questions (*"Could we explore this further?"*) instead of *"I’m far from convinced"*.
   - *Medium*: Written reviews or comments benefit from Semi‑Formal/Formal wording that travels well out of context.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Sounding like you have a closed mind (no mention of what evidence could convince you).
   - Attacking the person rather than the idea.
   - Using very strong doubt language in group settings where the presenter has little power or confidence.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In consensus‑oriented cultures, explicit statements like *"I’m far from convinced"* can be perceived as very confrontational. Questions and conditional language (*"I would need to see…"*) may carry the same message more acceptably.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Code/design review with peers → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal or Lively.
   - **Situation 2**: Written review for a paper or proposal → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal.
