   **Meaning**: 
   - To make or keep yourself far from someone or something physically, socially, or emotionally; to create separation.
   - To make something appear less connected to you (e.g. an idea, decision, or mistake).
   
   **Synonyms**: separate yourself from, detach yourself from, disassociate yourself from, step back from
   
   **Antonyms**: align yourself with, associate with, embrace, identify with
   
   **When to Use**: Use *distance yourself from* to describe deliberately moving far from a person, group, or position, especially to protect your reputation, independence, or well-being ("distance yourself from rumors", "distance the team from a failed strategy"). It is common in news and professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it for simple physical movement (use *move away from, walk away from*). It implies intention and often subtle social or political maneuvering.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - distance yourself from
   - distance the organization from
   - gradually distance oneself from
   - publicly distance from
   
   **Root Analysis**: distance (noun: how far from) → verb meaning "to make far from" + reflexive pronoun
   
   **Etymology**: From noun *distance* (Latin *distantia*), later used as a verb meaning "to keep at a distance".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I had to distance myself from that group—they were far from supportive.
   - She's been distancing herself from social media lately.

   - (Figurative) To become far from something in opinion, behavior, or results.
   
   **Synonyms**: depart from, deviate from, differ from, branch off, stray from
   
   **Antonyms**: converge, align with, coincide with, match
   
   **When to Use**: Use *diverge from* when describing lines, paths, or trends that move farther apart, or when opinions, strategies, or results become far from each other ("diverge from expectations"). It is frequent in technical, academic, and analytical writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid it in very casual speech where *go in a different direction* is clearer. Do not confuse with *divert* (change direction intentionally) or *divorce* (legal separation).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - diverge from expectations
   - diverge from the norm
   - paths diverge
   - opinions diverge
   
   **Root Analysis**: di- (apart) + vergere (Latin: to bend or turn) → "to bend apart"
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *divergere* (to go in different directions), via Medieval Latin and French into English, with both literal and figurative senses of "moving apart".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our plans started to diverge from each other—we wanted very different things.
   - Reality diverged pretty quickly from what we had imagined.

1. **Verb**: drift apart
   **Meaning**: 
   - To gradually become far from each other in relationship or closeness; to lose contact slowly over time.
   
   **Synonyms**: grow apart, move apart, become distant, lose touch
   
   **Antonyms**: grow closer, come together, reconnect, bond
   
   **When to Use**: Use *drift apart* mainly for people, groups, or relationships that slowly become more distant without a single dramatic event ("friends drift apart", "team and leadership drift apart"). It paints a picture of going from close to far from over time.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal documents (use *gradually become more distant*). It also implies lack of deliberate intention; if the separation is deliberate or sudden, another verb (*break with, cut off*) may fit better.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - drift apart over time
   - slowly drift apart
   - start to drift apart
   - drift apart from each other
   
   **Root Analysis**: drift (move slowly, often carried by a force) + apart (separately, far from each other)
   
   **Etymology**: *Drift* (Old Norse *drift* = a driving, current) + *apart* (from Old French *a part* = to one side). The phrasal verb suggests being carried away from each other by circumstances.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We didn't fight—we just drifted apart and ended up far from each other's lives.
   - After school, a lot of classmates drift apart and rarely talk.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: estrange, isolate, turn away, push away, distance
   
   **Antonyms**: include, engage, involve, welcome, draw in
   
   **When to Use**: Use *alienate (someone) from* to describe actions or systems that drive people far from feeling included or connected ("alienate employees from leadership", "alienate citizens from institutions"). It carries a strong negative tone.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it lightly in casual conversation; it often refers to serious social or emotional distance. Do not confuse with legal *alienate property* (to transfer ownership).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - alienate people from
   - alienate employees from
   - alienate voters from
   - feel alienated from
   
   **Root Analysis**: alien (other, foreign) + -ate (verb-forming suffix) + from
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *alienare* (to make someone a stranger, to estrange), from *alienus* (belonging to another). The modern use emphasizes being made to feel like an outsider—far from a group or identity.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you talk like that, you're going to alienate your friends from you.
