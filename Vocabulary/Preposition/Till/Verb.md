   **When to Use**: Use "till" in agricultural, farming, or gardening contexts when describing the preparation of soil for planting. Common in agricultural literature, farming discussions, and gardening instructions. Can be used both literally (actual farming) and metaphorically (preparing something for development).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use in modern urban contexts where "plow" or "cultivate" would be clearer. Avoid in contexts unrelated to land/soil preparation. Not appropriate for discussing mental or intellectual work (use "cultivate" instead). Less common in modern casual speech - "plow" is more frequently used in American English.

   **Root Analysis**: Old English "tilian" (to till, cultivate) - simple root without modern affixes
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "tilian" (to work at, obtain by labor, till, cultivate) → Middle English "tilen/tillen" - Germanic origin, related to Old Saxon "tilian" (to obtain), Old High German "zilōn" (to strive). Originally meant "to strive for, work for" and specialized to agricultural labor by Middle English.
