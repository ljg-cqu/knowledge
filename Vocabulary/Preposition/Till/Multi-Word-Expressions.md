1. **Expression**: from dawn till dusk (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From early morning (sunrise) until evening (sunset); all day long; throughout the entire day
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership with little variation)
   
   **Synonyms**: all day long, from sunrise to sunset, from morning to night, throughout the day, the whole day
   
   **Antonyms**: briefly, for a short time, intermittently
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize continuous activity or long duration of work/effort throughout an entire day. Common in descriptions of hard work, dedication, or intensive activity. Appropriate in both formal and informal contexts. Often used to emphasize the exhausting or demanding nature of work.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for actual astronomical dawn/dusk unless specifically intended. Not appropriate when describing literal work hours (use specific times). Avoid in technical or scientific contexts requiring precision. Can sound cliché if overused.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - from morning till night
   - from sunrise to sunset
   - dawn to dusk
   - from first light till dark
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Traditional agricultural expression referring to the natural working day determined by sunlight; "dawn" and "dusk" are natural paired opposites representing the bookends of daylight; culturally significant as representing a full day's honest work
   
   **Root Analysis**: "dawn" (Old English "dagian" - to become day) + "till" (Old English "til") + "dusk" (Old English "dox" - dark, dusky)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's been working on that project from dawn till dusk for weeks.
   - Those farmers are out there from dawn till dusk during harvest season.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: till death do us part (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Until one of us dies; for the entire duration of one's life; forever (in marriage context)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (extremely fixed traditional marriage vow phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: until death separates us, for the rest of our lives, forever, for life, till the end of time
   
   **Antonyms**: temporarily, for now, until divorce
   
   **When to Use**: Use in marriage ceremony contexts, romantic declarations, or discussions of lifelong commitment. Most commonly appears in traditional wedding vows. Can be used metaphorically to express extreme dedication or permanent commitment to non-romantic partnerships or causes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual relationship discussions (too solemn). Not appropriate for business partnerships (use "indefinitely" or "permanently"). Don't use sarcastically about negative situations unless the humor is clearly intentional. May be considered too traditional or religious for some modern ceremonies.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - till death us do part (older grammatical form)
   - until death do us part
   - till death parts us
   - till death
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Traditional Christian marriage vow dating from the Book of Common Prayer (1549); "death" represents the only acceptable termination of marriage in religious tradition; the archaic subjunctive "do... part" emphasizes the solemn, ceremonial nature; deeply embedded in Western wedding culture
   
   **Root Analysis**: "till" (OE "til") + "death" (OE "dēaþ") + archaic subjunctive construction "do... part" (OE "dāl" - to divide, separate)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They've been together since high school - it's definitely a "till death do us part" kind of love.
   - My grandparents meant it when they said "till death do us part" - they were married for 65 years.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The traditional marriage vows include the phrase "till death do us part" as an expression of lifelong commitment.
   - The couple exchanged rings and pledged to remain together till death do them part.

1. **Expression**: till the cows come home (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For an extremely long time; indefinitely; forever; until a point that may never arrive
   - *Literal meaning*: until cows return from pasture (typically at dusk)
   - *Figurative/Idiomatic meaning*: emphasizes that something could continue endlessly without reaching a conclusion
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed idiomatic expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: forever, indefinitely, endlessly, for ages, until doomsday, for an eternity
   
   **Antonyms**: briefly, for a short time, momentarily, quickly
   
   **When to Use**: Use informally to emphasize that something could continue for an impractically or unreasonably long time, often with exasperation or humor. Common in casual speech when discussing arguments, waiting, or futile activities. Often implies that the activity is pointless or will not achieve its goal despite the time spent.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal or professional writing (too colloquial). Not appropriate in serious or solemn contexts. Don't use when discussing actual agriculture or livestock. Can sound dismissive - avoid when you need to show respect for someone's efforts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - until the cows come home
   - till/until the cows come home
   - wait till the cows come home
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Agricultural origin from rural life; cows naturally return from pasture at dusk for milking, but "coming home" is used hyperbolically to suggest an indefinite wait; first documented in late 16th century Scotland; the phrase implies waiting for something that operates on its own slow, natural schedule beyond human control
   
   **Root Analysis**: "till" + "the cows" (plural of OE "cū") + "come" (OE "cuman") + "home" (OE "hām")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You can argue with him till the cows come home, but he won't change his mind.
   - We could wait for a perfect solution till the cows come home, or we could just start with what we have.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - *Typically informal; avoid in formal contexts*

1. **Expression**: till the end of time (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Forever; eternally; indefinitely into the future; as long as time exists
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: forever, eternally, for eternity, forevermore, until eternity, always, permanently
   
   **Antonyms**: briefly, temporarily, for now, for a moment
   
   **When to Use**: Use to express eternal commitment, permanent dedication, or endless duration. Common in romantic contexts, poetic language, religious statements, and emphatic promises. Appropriate for expressing deep emotional commitment or philosophical permanence.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in practical, literal contexts (use specific timeframes). Not appropriate in business or legal documents (use "in perpetuity" or "indefinitely"). Can sound melodramatic in casual contexts. Don't use when discussing actual temporal limits or practical considerations.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - until the end of time
   - to the end of time
   - till time ends
   - till the end of days
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Philosophical and poetic expression referencing the ultimate limit of temporal existence; "end of time" represents an absolute, unreachable boundary; common in religious and romantic discourse; emphasizes the infinite nature of the commitment or duration
   
   **Root Analysis**: "till" + "the" + "end" (OE "ende") + "of" + "time" (OE "tīma")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'll remember this moment till the end of time.
   - She promised to love him till the end of time.

1. **Expression**: from start till finish (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From the beginning to the end; throughout the entire process or duration; completely
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred partnership but variations exist)
   
   **Synonyms**: from beginning to end, from first to last, throughout, completely, all the way through, the whole way
   
   **Antonyms**: partially, incompletely, in parts, sporadically
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize completeness, thoroughness, or continuous involvement throughout an entire process, event, or project. Common in descriptions of participation, quality, or consistency. Appropriate in both formal and informal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when participation was intermittent (contradicts the meaning). Not appropriate when only specific phases are relevant. Avoid redundancy - don't use with other words meaning "completely" in the same sentence.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - from start to finish
   - from beginning till end
   - start to finish
   - from the start till the finish
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Start" and "finish" form a natural semantic pairing as absolute opposites marking temporal boundaries; "till" emphasizes the continuous connection between these endpoints; high frequency of co-occurrence in describing complete processes; semantic compatibility creates natural-sounding expression
   
   **Root Analysis**: "from" + "start" (OE "styrtan" - to jump up, begin) + "till" + "finish" (Latin "finire" via French "finiss-")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That movie was amazing from start till finish!
   - I was nervous from start till finish of my presentation.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: till now (type: collocation)

   - Up to the present moment; until this point in time; up to today
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly frequent collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: until now, up to now, so far, thus far, to date, up to this point
   
   **Antonyms**: since then, from now on, hereafter
   
   **When to Use**: Use when referring to a period extending from the past up to the current moment. Common in both speech and writing to indicate something that has been true or ongoing until the present. Often used to introduce a change or new information.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when referring to the future (use "from now" or "from now on"). Avoid confusion with "by now" (which means "at this point, something should have happened"). Not appropriate when a specific past time is meant rather than "up to the present."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - until now
   - up till now
   - up until now
   - till this moment
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Now" is the natural endpoint for a temporal expression using "till"; extremely high frequency of co-occurrence; "till" specifically requires a time endpoint and "now" is the most common present-moment reference; conventional usage creates strong expectation for this pairing
   
   **Root Analysis**: "till" + "now" (OE "nū")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I haven't heard from her till now - I hope she's okay.
   - Till now, everything's been going smoothly.
