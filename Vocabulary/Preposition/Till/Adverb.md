   **Antonyms**: from now on, hereafter, in the future, after this
   
   **When to Use**: Use to indicate that something has been true or has occurred during the period extending from the past to the present moment.

   - up till now, everything has been...
   - up till now, no one has...
   - the best/worst/only... up till now

   **Root Analysis**: "up" (OE "up" - upward, indicating extent) + "till" (OE "til") + "now" (OE "nū")
   
   **Etymology**: Phrasal construction combining "up" (emphasizing the extent or reaching of a limit) + "till" (preposition/conjunction) + "now" - emerged as common collocation in Modern English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Up till now, I've been pretty patient, but enough is enough!

1. **Adverb**: right up till/until (type: degree + time - phrasal adverb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Continuing without interruption all the way to a specified time; emphasizing the complete duration up to the endpoint without gap
   - "Right" intensifies "up till" to emphasize continuity and proximity to the endpoint
   - Functions as time adverbial with emphatic degree modification
   
   **Synonyms**: all the way till, straight through until, continuously until, right until, up to the very moment
   
   **Antonyms**: well before, long before, with time to spare

   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when there was a significant gap or early completion (contradicts the meaning). Not appropriate when you want to emphasize advance preparation. Avoid when "till" alone would suffice without the emphasis.

   - worked right up till...
   - stayed right up till...
   - continued right up till...

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when no clear future reference has been established (listeners won't know what "then" refers to). Not appropriate when you mean "at that time" rather than "until that time." Don't use for distant future without recent mention.

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the limitation might disappoint or when longer duration would be preferred. Not appropriate when you want to emphasize generosity of time rather than limitation. Don't use when "only" makes the restriction seem stingy.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - only till [specific time]
   - valid only till
   - available only till
   - lasting only till
   - good only till
