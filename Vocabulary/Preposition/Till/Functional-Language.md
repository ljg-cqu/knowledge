1. **Functional Expression**: Wait till... (pattern: wait till + [time/event]) (function: instructing/directing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to instruct someone to delay action until a specific time or event occurs; directive to postpone or hold off
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: hold on until, don't act until, delay until, wait until, hold off till
   
   **Antonyms**: do it now, act immediately, don't wait, hurry up
   
   **When to Use**: Use when giving instructions or advice to delay action until conditions are right. Common in everyday conversation, instructions, warnings, and advice-giving. Appropriate when timing is important for success or safety. Can express urgency about not acting too soon.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when immediate action is required. Not appropriate in emergency situations requiring quick response. Don't use when the delay could be harmful. Can sound controlling if tone is not carefully managed.
   
   **Common Variations**:

   - Wait till after...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses negative politeness strategy by directing behavior; can be softened with "just" or "maybe you should"; tone is crucial - can sound like helpful advice or controlling command depending on delivery; imperative mood creates directness that may need mitigation in formal contexts
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Okay, I'll wait (accepting)
   - Why? What's going to happen? (questioning/requesting clarification)
   - I can't wait that long (declining/expressing constraint)

   - I'm not doing... till...
   - Not till you...
