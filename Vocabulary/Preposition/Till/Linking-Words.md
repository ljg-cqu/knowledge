1. **Linking Word**: till (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a temporal clause indicating the time up to which an action continues or the point at which a situation changes; until
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship showing duration or continuity up to a specified point; connects main clause with dependent time clause
   
   **Synonyms**: until, up until, up to the time that, up to when, before
   
   **Antonyms**: since, from the time that, after, once
   
   **When to Use**: Use "till" to connect clauses where one action continues up to the point when another action occurs or a condition is met. Common in both speech and writing, though slightly more informal than "until". Suitable for expressing waiting, continuation, or persistence up to a specific moment.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid starting formal written sentences with "till" (prefer "until"). Don't use when you need to indicate the starting point (use "since" or "from"). Not appropriate in highly formal academic or legal writing. Don't confuse with "while" (simultaneous action) or "before" (precedence without duration).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + till + [dependent time clause]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence connecting two clauses, rarely sentence-initial
   - [Punctuation]: no comma needed when "till" clause follows main clause; comma needed when "till" clause precedes main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "till" with "'til" (informal contraction, often considered incorrect); using "from" without proper correlative "till"; starting formal documents with "till"
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "til" (simple subordinating conjunction, no affixes)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "til" → Middle English "til/till" - developed subordinating conjunction function by Middle English period, parallel to its prepositional use
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's wait here till everyone arrives.
   - I'm not leaving till you tell me what's wrong.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee will continue deliberations till a consensus is reached.
   - Operations will remain suspended till safety protocols are fully implemented.

1. **Linking Word**: till such time as (type: subordinating conjunction phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a temporal clause in a more formal way; until the point or moment when a specified condition is met
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship with added formality and emphasis on the conditional nature of the endpoint
   
   **Synonyms**: until such time as, until, pending, until the time when
   
   **Antonyms**: from the time when, since, as soon as
   
   **When to Use**: Use "till such time as" in formal, legal, or official contexts where you need to emphasize conditionality and formal tone. Common in contracts, official statements, policy documents, and formal announcements. Appropriate when the endpoint is conditional rather than fixed.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (too formal and wordy). Don't use when a simple "till" or "until" would suffice. Not appropriate for everyday writing. Overuse can make text sound bureaucratic or pompous.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + till such time as + [dependent condition clause]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence, rarely sentence-initial
   - [Punctuation]: no comma needed when "till such time as" clause follows main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using in casual contexts; mixing with informal language in the same sentence
   
   **Root Analysis**: "till" (conjunction) + "such" (determiner) + "time" (noun) + "as" (conjunction)
   
   **Etymology**: Formulaic expression developed in legal/formal English from Middle English period onwards, combining temporal "till" with the formal intensifier "such... as"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not typically used in casual speech; use "till" or "until" instead]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The suspension will remain in effect till such time as the investigation is complete.
   - Access to the facility will be restricted till such time as proper security measures are implemented.

1. **Linking Word**: not till/not until (type: subordinating conjunction with negation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to emphasize that an action does not occur before a specified point; only when/after
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship with emphasis on delay or postponement; often used for emphasis or to show that something happened later than expected
   
   **Synonyms**: only when, only after, not before, it was not until
   
   **Antonyms**: as soon as, immediately when, before
   
   **When to Use**: Use "not till/not until" to emphasize timing, delay, or late realization. Common in both speech and narrative writing. Particularly effective for dramatic effect or to show surprise. Can appear in both standard and inverted sentence structures.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't overuse for simple temporal statements where "when" would suffice. Avoid when timing is not significant to the meaning. Be careful with double negatives - don't use "not till" with other negatives in the same clause.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [do/does/did] + not + [verb] + till + [time clause]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence or sentence-initial (inverted structure: "Not till... did...")
   - [Punctuation]: comma after initial "not till" clause in inverted structures
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Double negatives; incorrect word order in inverted structures; confusing emphasis vs. simple negation
   
   **Root Analysis**: "not" (negative adverb) + "till" (subordinating conjunction)
   
   **Etymology**: Emphatic construction developed in Middle English, combining standard negation with temporal "till"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I didn't realize the problem till you mentioned it.
   - We're not leaving till this mess is cleaned up!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The full extent of the issue was not understood till the comprehensive audit was completed.
   - Not till the final data were analyzed did the researchers recognize the significance of their findings.
