1. **Preposition**: till (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* up to the point in time or the event mentioned; until
   - *(Spatial)* (less common) up to a particular place or point
   
   **Synonyms**: until, up to, up until, through to, as far as
   
   **Antonyms**: from, since, after, beyond
   
   **When to Use**: Use "till" for temporal relationships indicating a point in time that marks the end of a period or action. Common in both spoken and written English, though slightly more informal than "until". Also used in spatial contexts to indicate extent or limit.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid "till" at the beginning of formal sentences (use "until" instead). Don't confuse with "'til" (contraction, often considered incorrect). Don't use when indicating origin or starting point (use "from" or "since"). Not typically used in highly formal academic writing.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: till now, till then, till morning, till the end, till midnight, till tomorrow
   - **Verb + prep**: wait till, stay till, work till, continue till, last till
   - **Adjective + prep**: available till, open till, valid till
   - **Noun + prep**: time till (departure), days till (deadline)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "til" (to, until) - simple preposition without prefix or suffix
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "til" → Middle English "til/till" - Germanic origin, related to Old Norse "til" (to, until). Originally meant "to" and gradually developed the temporal meaning "until" by the 12th century.

1. **Preposition**: till (used in "from... till" construction) (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* marking the end point of a duration that starts from a specified time
   - *(Spatial)* marking the end point of a distance or extent
   
   **Synonyms**: until, through, to, up to
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (part of correlative construction)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in "from X till Y" constructions to indicate a complete span of time or distance. This pattern emphasizes both endpoints of a duration or extent. Common in schedules, timetables, and descriptions of periods.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use "from till" without specifying both endpoints. Don't mix with "until" in the same construction (use either "from... till" or "from... until", not "from... till... until").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: from morning till night, from dawn till dusk, from Monday till Friday, from start till finish, from head till toe
   - **Verb + prep**: work from... till, operate from... till, run from... till
   - **Adjective + prep**: open from... till, available from... till
   - **Noun + prep**: period from... till, duration from... till
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as above - Old English "til"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "til" - used in correlative constructions since Middle English period
