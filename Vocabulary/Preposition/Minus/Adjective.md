1. **Adjective**: negative (comp: more negative, sup: most negative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Mathematics) expressing, containing, or consisting of a quantity less than zero
   - (General) indicating the absence rather than the presence of something; characterized by negation or denial
   - (Attitude) pessimistic, critical, or harmful; lacking positive or constructive qualities (gradable, predicative or attributive)
   
   **Synonyms**: minus, below-zero, subtractive, pessimistic, unfavorable

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - negative number
   - negative attitude
   - negative impact
   - test negative
   - negative feedback
   
   **Root Analysis**: neg- (not, no) + -ative (characterized by)
