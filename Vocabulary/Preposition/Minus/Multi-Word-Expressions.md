1. **Expression**: take away (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To remove or subtract one number or amount from another; to perform subtraction (especially in educational contexts)
   - *For literal meaning*: To physically remove something from a place
   - *Fixedness*: medium (commonly used in mathematical contexts, but "take" and "away" can sometimes be separated)
   
   **Synonyms**: subtract, minus, remove, deduct, less
   
   **Antonyms**: add, plus, give, include, put in
   
   **When to Use**: Use in elementary mathematics education; in casual calculations and explanations; in British English (more common than American); when teaching subtraction to children; in everyday mathematical discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal mathematical writing (use "subtract" instead); don't use in professional financial documents; avoid in academic mathematics papers; don't use when discussing complex mathematical operations
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "take [X] away from [Y]"
   - "if you take away [X]"
   - "taking away [X] leaves [Y]"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal verb*: "Take" (remove) + "away" (from a place) creates natural partnership for subtraction concept; mirrors physical act of removing objects; "away" indicates direction of removal; very concrete and child-friendly imagery
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English tacan (to take, grasp) + Old English aweg (away, from this place)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Five take away three is two—easy!"
   - "If you take away the shipping cost, it's actually a good deal."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - *Typically informal; use "subtract" in formal contexts*
   - "In the initial stages of learning, students use 'take away' before mastering 'subtract.'"

2. **Expression**: minus sign (type: collocation - noun + noun)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The mathematical symbol (−) representing subtraction or negative values; the dash or horizontal line indicating subtraction operation
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed terminology in mathematics)
   
   **Synonyms**: subtraction sign, negative sign, dash (in context)
   
   **Antonyms**: plus sign, addition sign
   
   **When to Use**: Use in mathematical instruction and explanations; when discussing notation and symbols; in teaching contexts explaining operations; when distinguishing from other similar symbols (hyphen, dash); in typography and typesetting discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when "negative" alone would suffice (e.g., "negative number" not "minus sign number"); avoid over-explaining in contexts where everyone understands the symbol; don't confuse with hyphen in non-mathematical contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "the minus symbol"
   - "negative sign"
   - "subtraction symbol"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Minus" specifies which sign; "sign" indicates it's a symbol/notation; fixed pairing in mathematical terminology; parallels "plus sign"; essential for distinguishing from similar marks (hyphen, en-dash, em-dash)
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin minus (less) + sign (mark, token)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "What's that little minus sign thing supposed to mean?"
   - "Just put a minus sign before the number to make it negative."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The minus sign indicates both subtraction operations and negative quantities."
   - "Students must distinguish between the minus sign and the hyphen in written mathematics."

3. **Expression**: net of (type: fixed phrase - preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - After deducting; with a specified amount or factor subtracted; indicating the result after removing certain components
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed financial and business terminology)
   
   **Synonyms**: after deducting, minus, less, excluding, after subtracting
   
   **Antonyms**: gross of, including, before deducting, plus
   
   **When to Use**: Use in financial, accounting, and business contexts; when discussing net amounts after deductions; in formal business writing; when precision about what has been subtracted is important; in contracts and financial reports
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (use "after" or "minus" instead); don't use when "after" would be simpler and clearer; avoid in non-financial contexts where it might sound pretentious; don't use without specifying what is being deducted
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "net of taxes"
   - "net of deductions"
   - "net of expenses"
   - "net of fees"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: "Net" (remaining after deductions) + "of" (indicating what is deducted) forms precise financial terminology; "net" originates from "clear/pure" concept; "of" specifies what has been removed; essential for financial clarity and precision
   
   **Root Analysis**: French net (clean, pure) from Latin nitidus + of (from Old English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - *Typically formal; rarely used casually*
   - "So that's what I get, net of all the deductions?"
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The investment return, net of management fees, was 7.2%."
   - "Revenue net of returns and allowances totaled $5.3 million."

4. **Expression**: take off (type: phrasal verb - in reduction context)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To subtract or deduct an amount from a total; to remove a portion from a price or score

   **Antonyms**: add on, put on, increase by, mark up
   
   **When to Use**: Use in commercial contexts for discounts; in informal calculations; when discussing price reductions; in grading contexts for deducting points; in negotiations about prices; in casual financial discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal financial documents (use "deduct"); don't use in formal mathematics (use "subtract"); avoid in contexts where "take off" might be confused with its other meanings (remove clothing, departure); don't use in written contracts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "take [amount] off"
   - "take off [amount]"
   - "if we take off [amount]"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal verb*: "Take" (remove) + "off" (away from surface/total) creates natural subtraction imagery; mirrors physical action of removing layer or portion; "off" suggests separation from original whole; very intuitive for learners
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English tacan (take) + Old English of (off, from)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Can you take 10% off the price if I buy two?"
   - "The teacher took off five points for spelling errors."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: in the black (profitable), profitable, in the positive, making money
   
   **When to Use**: Use in business and financial discussions about losses; in accounting contexts; when discussing personal or corporate financial difficulties; in journalism about business performance; when describing deficit situations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal financial reports (use precise terminology); don't use when exact figures are more important than general status; avoid in contexts where the idiom might not be understood (non-native speakers, formal academic writing); don't use for non-financial deficits
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "running in the red"
   - "staying in the red"
   - "deep in the red"
   - "slip into the red"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: Origin from bookkeeping practice of using red ink for negative balances; "in" indicates state; "the red" represents the colored ink used; contrasts with "in the black" (profitable); culturally embedded business metaphor
   
   **Root Analysis**: Idiomatic expression from accounting practice (red ink for losses)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "We're totally in the red this month—spent way too much."
   - "My bank account is in the red until payday."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - *Fixedness*: medium (can be separated)
   
   **Synonyms**: take off, deduct, reduce by, discount, cut (from price)
   
   **Antonyms**: add on, mark up, increase by, tack on
   
   **When to Use**: Use in very informal price negotiations; in casual shopping contexts; when discussing unofficial discounts or deals; in friendly bargaining situations; when emphasizing informality or casualness of deduction
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in professional business contexts; don't use in written contracts or formal agreements; avoid in contexts where "knock off" might mean "stop work" or "counterfeit goods"; don't use with clients requiring professional tone
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "knock [amount] off"
   - "knock off [amount]"
   - "can you knock something off?"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal verb*: "Knock" (strike, remove forcefully) + "off" (away, from) creates emphatic removal imagery; suggests quick, decisive reduction; informal tone from "knock" (physical action metaphor); implies negotiation or favor
   
   **Root Analysis**: Middle English knocken (to strike) + Old English of (off)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Can you knock $20 off the price if I pay cash?"
   - "The seller knocked off another hundred bucks at the end."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - *Typically informal; avoid in formal contexts*

   - At a temperature lower than the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F); in negative temperature range; indicating minus temperatures
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed temperature terminology)
   
   **Synonyms**: sub-zero, negative temperature, minus degrees, freezing, under zero
   
   **Antonyms**: above zero, positive temperature, above freezing
   
   **When to Use**: Use in weather discussions about cold temperatures; in scientific contexts discussing temperatures; when explaining freezing conditions; in everyday conversation about cold weather; in news reports about extreme cold
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when specific temperature numbers would be clearer; don't use in scientific papers without specifying scale (Celsius vs. Fahrenheit); avoid when "negative" would be more precise for technical contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "temperatures below zero"
   - "well below zero"
   - "drop below zero"
   - "falling below zero"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: "Below" (under, less than) + "zero" (the freezing point reference) creates clear temperature reference; zero serves as natural reference point for freezing; "below" indicates direction on temperature scale; universally understood cold indicator
   
   **Root Analysis**: Middle English bilowen (below) + Old Italian zero (zero, cipher)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "It's supposed to go below zero tonight—bundle up!"
   - "I can't believe it stayed below zero all week."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Temperatures below zero Celsius significantly impact infrastructure maintenance."
   - "The region experienced prolonged periods with temperatures below zero."

8. **Expression**: cut from (type: phrasal verb - removal/elimination context)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To remove or eliminate someone or something from a group, list, or plan; to exclude by cutting; to subtract from a total or budget

   **When to Use**: Use in budget discussions when removing expenses; in editing contexts when eliminating content; in sports contexts (cut from team); in selection processes; when discussing reductions in scope or participation; in resource allocation discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the cutting metaphor might be too harsh (use "remove" instead); don't use when permanent exclusion isn't meant; avoid in sensitive contexts where "eliminate" might sound harsh; don't use for minor adjustments (use "reduce")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "cut [item] from [budget/list]"
   - "cut from the team"
   - "cut out from the plan"
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal verb*: "Cut" (sever, remove decisively) + "from" (indicating source/origin) creates decisive removal imagery; cutting implies permanent separation; "from" shows original membership or inclusion; common in editorial and budgetary contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: Middle English cutten (to cut) + Old English from (from, away from)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "They cut him from the team after tryouts."
   - "We had to cut that scene from the final edit."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The committee elected to cut three programs from the budget."
