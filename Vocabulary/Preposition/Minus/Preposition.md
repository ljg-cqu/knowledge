1. **Preposition**: minus (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Mathematical)* used to indicate subtraction or the removal of one quantity from another (e.g., 10 minus 3 equals 7)
   - *(Abstract)* used to indicate the absence or removal of something previously present or expected (e.g., the house minus the furniture)
   - *(Informal - Exclusion)* used to indicate something is lacking or removed from a situation (e.g., it's fine minus the noise)
   
   **Synonyms**: without (general), less (mathematical), excluding (formal), deducting (formal), subtracting (mathematical)
   
   **Antonyms**: plus, with, including, adding, combined with
   
   **When to Use**: Use when performing subtraction in mathematics; when indicating something has been removed or is absent; in informal speech to describe a situation lacking one element; when calculating net amounts after deductions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing as a sentence connector; don't use when addition or inclusion is meant; avoid using as a casual replacement for "without" in professional documents; don't use when "except" would be more precise
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: minus tax, minus expenses, minus deductions, minus interest, minus fees
   - **Verb + prep**: calculate minus, subtract minus, deduct minus
   - **Adjective + prep**: valued at X minus Y
   - **Noun + prep**: total minus, amount minus, price minus, temperature minus
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin "minus" meaning "less"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → Old French → Middle English; entered English directly from Latin "minus" (meaning "less"), originally used primarily in mathematical contexts in the 15th century, later expanded to general subtractive and exclusionary uses
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The party was great minus the awkward moment when John showed up.
   - I'll take the burger minus the onions, please.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The net profit amounts to gross revenue minus operational expenses and taxes.
   - The sample population consists of all participants minus those who withdrew consent.

2. **Preposition**: minus (type: simple - adjective-like usage)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Mathematical notation)* indicating a negative value or quantity below zero (e.g., minus 10 degrees)
   - *(Grading/Rating)* indicating a slightly lower grade than the letter alone (e.g., B minus, grade of 80 minus)
   - *(Deficiency)* indicating a disadvantage or lacking quality (e.g., on the minus side)
   
   **Synonyms**: negative (in mathematics), below (in temperature contexts), lower than (in grading)
   
   **Antonyms**: plus, positive, above
   
   **When to Use**: Use in mathematical contexts to denote negative numbers; in grading systems to indicate incremental reduction; in temperature readings below zero; in rating systems to show slight disadvantage; when discussing pros and cons
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use in contexts where precision requires exact numerical values; avoid in formal scientific writing where "negative" is preferred; don't use when describing complete absence
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: minus five, minus ten degrees, plus or minus, on the minus side
   - **Adjective + prep**: temperature is minus, grade of B minus
   - **Noun + prep**: minus sign, minus value, minus point, minus rating
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin "minus" (less)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → mathematical notation; adopted from Latin mathematical treatises in the 15th century, expanded to temperature scales in 18th century
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's minus 5 degrees outside—way too cold for me!
   - I got a B minus on the test, but I'll do better next time.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The experimental results showed a deviation of minus 2.3 percent.
   - Students receiving grades of C minus or below must repeat the course.

3. **Preposition**: minus (type: simple - loss or disadvantage context)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract - Loss)* used to indicate that something valuable is no longer present or has been lost (e.g., the team minus their star player)
   - *(Comparative)* used to emphasize what is lacking or inferior about something (e.g., it's like the original minus the charm)
   
   **Synonyms**: deprived of, stripped of, lacking, bereft of, wanting
   
   **Antonyms**: equipped with, enhanced by, augmented by, supplemented with
   
   **When to Use**: When describing a situation where an important element is missing; when comparing two things where one lacks what the other has; when discussing losses or removals that affect quality or capability
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the missing element is insignificant; don't use in contexts requiring empathy about loss (use "without" instead); avoid in legal documents where precision is required
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: life minus X, team minus players, version minus features
   - **Verb + prep**: operate minus, function minus, perform minus
   - **Noun + prep**: situation minus, scenario minus, version minus
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin "minus" (less)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → extended usage; metaphorical extension from mathematical subtraction to social/qualitative contexts (17th-18th centuries)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's basically the iPhone minus all the cool features.
   - The show was okay minus the terrible ending.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee proceeded with deliberations minus the absent members.
   - The revised proposal represents the original plan minus several cost-prohibitive elements.
