1. **Functional Expression**: "Could you subtract [amount] from [total]?" (function: requesting calculation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request asking someone to perform a subtraction operation or make a deduction
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (modal verb softens request)
   
   **Synonyms**: Could you deduct [amount]?, Can you take [amount] off?, Would you mind removing [amount]?, Please subtract [amount]
   
   **Antonyms**: Could you add [amount]?, Can you include [amount]?
   
   **When to Use**: Use in professional or educational contexts when requesting mathematical calculations; in business settings when asking for price adjustments; when you want to be polite but clear; in collaborative problem-solving
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal written documents (be more direct); don't use when immediate action without negotiation is required; avoid in emergency situations requiring direct commands
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "Can you subtract [amount] from [total]?" (slightly more casual)
   - "Please subtract [amount] from [total]" (more direct, still polite)
   - "Would it be possible to subtract [amount]?" (very formal, tentative)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Using "could" instead of "can" increases politeness through greater indirectness; this is negative politeness strategy (respects hearer's autonomy); appropriate when requesting favors or non-obligatory actions
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Sure, [result]" (accepting, casual)
   - "Of course, that would be [result]" (accepting, formal)
   - "I'm not sure I can do that, but..." (declining with explanation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Could you subtract the tax from that total? I want to see the base price."
   - "Hey, could you subtract 15% and tell me what we owe?"
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Could you subtract the administrative fees from the quoted amount?"
   - "I would appreciate it if you could subtract the deposit from the final invoice."

2. **Functional Expression**: "That's [X] minus [Y]" (function: explaining calculation/result)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A declarative statement explaining that a result is derived by subtracting one value from another
   - *Formality*: neutral/informal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: That equals [X] less [Y], The result is [X] take away [Y], [X] minus [Y] gives you [result]
   
   **Antonyms**: That's [X] plus [Y], That's [X] combined with [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explaining calculations to others; in educational contexts when teaching subtraction; in business contexts when clarifying how amounts were calculated; when transparency about deductions is important
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use in very formal mathematical proofs (use proper notation); avoid when the calculation is obvious and stating it seems condescending; don't use when more sophisticated financial terminology is expected
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "The answer is [X] minus [Y]" (slightly more formal)
   - "[X] take away [Y] is [result]" (more casual, elementary)
   - "If you subtract [Y] from [X], you get [result]" (explanatory)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression serves both informative and explanatory functions; it makes calculation process transparent; useful in teaching contexts and when building trust through transparency
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Got it, thanks" (acknowledgment, casual)
   - "That makes sense" (understanding)
   - "Wait, how did you get that?" (requesting clarification)

3. **Functional Expression**: "We need to deduct [amount/item] from [total/group]" (function: stating necessity of subtraction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Expressing the necessity or requirement to subtract or remove something from a total
   - *Formality*: neutral/semi-formal
   - *Directness*: direct (clear obligation statement)
   
   **Synonyms**: We must subtract [amount] from [total], We have to remove [item], It's necessary to deduct [amount], [Amount] needs to be subtracted
   
   **Antonyms**: We need to add [amount] to [total], We must include [item]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in professional settings when identifying necessary deductions; in accounting and finance contexts; when making corrections to calculations; when discussing budget adjustments; when stating requirements clearly
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you're actually requesting permission (use "Can we deduct...?" instead); don't use when announcing already completed actions (use "We have deducted..."); avoid when the action is optional (use "We could deduct...")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "We'll need to deduct [amount]" (future-oriented)
   - "We should deduct [amount]" (suggestion, less obligatory)

4. **Functional Expression**: "If we remove [X], we're left with [Y]" (function: explaining conditional subtraction result)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explaining the result that would occur if something were subtracted or removed; hypothetical subtraction scenario
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (conditional structure)
   
   **Synonyms**: If we subtract [X], we get [Y], Taking away [X] leaves us with [Y], Without [X], we have [Y], Minus [X], that leaves [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: If we add [X], we get [Y], Including [X] gives us [Y]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when exploring scenarios or possibilities; in planning discussions when considering options; when teaching by example; in analytical contexts when isolating variables; when emphasizing consequences of removal
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when stating definite rather than hypothetical scenarios; don't use when the conditional aspect might cause confusion about whether action has occurred; avoid in contexts requiring absolute certainty
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "If we take away [X], we're left with [Y]" (slightly more casual)
   - "Removing [X] would leave us with [Y]" (more formal)
   - "Without [X], we'd have [Y]" (emphasizes absence)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The conditional structure allows for non-committal exploration of options; useful for scenario planning without making definite commitments; allows face-saving if suggestion is rejected; softer than stating definite action
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "That would work" (positive evaluation)
   - "But we can't remove [X] because..." (rejecting premise)

   **Meaning**: 
   - Politely informing someone that a deduction must be made, with regret indicated by "I'm afraid"
   - *Formality*: semi-formal
   - *Directness*: indirect (hedged with "I'm afraid," softened with "have to")
   
   **Synonyms**: Unfortunately, we need to subtract [amount], I'm sorry, but we must deduct [amount], Regrettably, [amount] will be deducted
   
   **Antonyms**: I'm happy to say we can add [amount], Fortunately, we can include [amount]
