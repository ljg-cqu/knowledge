   **Meaning**:

   **Synonyms**: go with, join, tag along with, accompany, come too
   
   **Antonyms**: stay behind, go alone, remain, sit out
   
   **When to Use**: When inviting or describing someone joining along with others for an activity, visit, or event (come along with us, come along with the group)

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Come" (move toward the speaker) pairs naturally with "along" (in the same direction) and "with" (together with) to highlight movement together, physically or socially.
   
   **Root Analysis**: come (move toward) + along (in the same direction) + with (accompanied by)

   **Synonyms**: take [X] with [Y], carry [X] together with [Y], include [X] along with [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: leave [X] behind, omit [X], separate [X] from [Y]

   **Why This Partnership**:

   - go along with the suggestion
   - go along with what they proposed
   - refuse to go along with
   
   **Why This Partnership**:
