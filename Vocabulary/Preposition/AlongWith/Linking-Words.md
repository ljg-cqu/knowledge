1. **Linking Word**: along with (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used for saying that one person or thing is together with another person or thing, or is included with it as something extra
   - *Function*: Introduces an additional element that accompanies or supplements a main subject; marks addition while keeping focus on the primary item.
   
   **Synonyms**: together with, in addition to, as well as, coupled with, alongside
   
   **Antonyms**: without, apart from, excluding, instead of
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to add people, things, or information that come together with a main element, especially in written and semi-formal contexts ("The CEO, along with the team, …").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When both items should be grammatically equal subjects (simple "and" is safer); when subject–verb agreement becomes confusing ("The manager, along with the staff, *is*" not "*are*").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main subject], along with [additional phrase], [verb] …
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence after the main noun phrase
   - [Punctuation]: usually set off by commas as a parenthetical phrase
   - [Common errors to avoid]: treating the added phrase as a second subject for agreement; overloading sentences with long "along with" lists.
   
   **Root Analysis**: along (lengthwise, following a path) + with (accompanied by) → expresses moving or existing together with something.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English andlang (along, lengthwise) + with (in company with) → phrase gained strong additive function in Modern English.

   - [Clause structure]: [Noun phrase], together with [added phrase], [verb] …
   - [Position]: often follows the main subject as a parenthetical
   - [Punctuation]: commonly surrounded by commas when non-essential

   **Root Analysis**: together (in company) + with (accompanied by) → stresses jointness and shared presence.

   - [Clause structure]: [Factor 1], coupled with [Factor 2], [verb] …
   - [Position]: usually after the first factor; used as a modifying phrase
   - [Punctuation]: set off by commas when non-essential
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overusing the phrase where simple coordination is sufficient; applying it to unrelated items.
   
   **Root Analysis**: couple (join, pair) + -ed (past participle) + with (together with) → highlights pairing and combined effect.
