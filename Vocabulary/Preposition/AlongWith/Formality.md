1. **Original Expression**: Do you want to come along with us?  
   **Context**: Informal spoken invitation asking someone to join a group activity.
   
   **Core Intent**: Invite someone to join along with others for an event or activity.
   
   **Casual**: Do you wanna come along with us?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "wanna" contraction; very relaxed intonation; "come along with" highlights joining the group.  
   *Use when*: Talking to friends, peers, or close colleagues in relaxed settings.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Would you like to come along with us?  
   *Characteristics*: Modal "would" softens the invitation; "like to" is polite; retains "come along with" to emphasize inclusion.  
   *Use when*: Inviting coworkers, acquaintances, or guests in everyday professional or social contexts.
   
   **Formal**: Would you like to accompany us?  
   *Characteristics*: Replaces "come along with" with "accompany"; more formal verb; avoids colloquial rhythm.  
   *Use when*: Addressing clients, seniors, or official visitors; written invitations or formal speech.
   
   **Humorous**: Wanna come along with us and cause some harmless chaos?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses playful exaggeration ("harmless chaos"); keeps casual "wanna" and "come along with"; light, friendly tone.  
   *Use when*: Among friends or close teammates where humor and informality are welcome.  
   *Avoid when*: In serious, high-stakes, or hierarchical contexts.
   
   **Lively**: Why don’t you come along with us and make it even more fun?  
   *Characteristics*: Uses "Why don’t you…" suggestion; upbeat framing ("make it even more fun"); energetic tone.  
   *Use when*: Motivating colleagues to join team-building, social events, or group activities.
   
   **Empathetic**: If you’d like some company, you’re very welcome to come along with us.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges emotional state ("if you’d like some company"); soft, caring tone; "very welcome" signals warmth.  
   *Use when*: Inviting someone who might feel left out, anxious, or alone.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use more formal variants ("accompany us") with superiors or external stakeholders; casual "wanna come along" suits equal-status friends.
   - *Social Distance*: With close friends, casual/humorous is fine; with acquaintances or new colleagues, use semi-formal "Would you like to come along with us?".
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For light social outings, casual or lively is appropriate; for formal events or sensitive visits (e.g., hospital, official meeting), choose formal or empathetic versions.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect more formal phrasing with elders or higher status; "accompany us" or "you’re very welcome to come along with us" may be safer than "wanna come along".
   - *Medium*: In writing (emails, invitations), avoid "wanna" and prefer semi-formal or formal variants.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using very casual "wanna come along with us?" in emails to clients or senior managers (too informal).
   - Dropping "with us" and saying only "Do you want to come along?" when it is unclear who the person would join.
   - Sounding pushy by saying "You should come along with us" when the listener might not want to.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some contexts, group invitations signal strong inclusion; in others, people may feel pressured. Using conditional softeners ("If you’d like…", "Would you like…") with "come along with us" shows respect for autonomy.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Inviting a new colleague to lunch → **Appropriate Variant**: "Would you like to come along with us to lunch?" (semi-formal, welcoming without pressure).
   - **Situation 2**: Asking a close friend to join a weekend trip → **Appropriate Variant**: "Do you wanna come along with us this weekend?" (casual and friendly).
   - **Situation 3**: Inviting a senior guest to visit a project site → **Appropriate Variant**: "Would you like to accompany us to the site visit?" (formal and respectful).

   **Core Intent**: Express agreement or acceptance of a plan along with others, often as a compromise.
   
   **Casual**: Okay, I’ll go along with your plan.

   *Use when*: Talking with peers, teammates, or friends about shared decisions.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I’m happy to go along with your plan.  
   *Characteristics*: Adds positive stance ("happy to"); polite and cooperative; keeps "go along with" for mild alignment.  
   *Use when*: Professional settings where you want to show support without sounding too casual.
   
   **Formal**: I am prepared to support your plan.  
   *Characteristics*: Replaces idiomatic "go along with" with "support"; more neutral, formal verb; avoids colloquial rhythm.  
   *Use when*: Meetings, written communication, or cross-functional discussions where clarity and formality are necessary.
   
   **Humorous**: Fine, I’ll go along with your plan—as long as it doesn’t blow up in our faces.  
   *Characteristics*: Light sarcasm and exaggeration; keeps "go along with"; adds playful condition.  
   *Use when*: Among close colleagues or friends who share humor and trust.  
   *Avoid when*: The stakes are high, or someone might feel criticized.
   
   **Lively**: Sure, I’ll go along with your plan—let’s see where it takes us.  
   *Characteristics*: Upbeat opener ("Sure"); forward-looking phrase ("let’s see where it takes us"); energetic tone.  
   *Use when*: Motivating a team, brainstorming, or trying to create momentum.
   
   **Empathetic**: I know you’ve put a lot of thought into this, so I’ll go along with your plan.  
   *Characteristics*: Recognizes effort and feelings; "I know you’ve put a lot of thought into this" validates the other person; "go along with" signals supportive compromise.  
   *Use when*: The other person is emotionally invested or nervous about their proposal.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With superiors, consider "I am prepared to support your plan"; with peers, "I’ll go along with your plan" or "I’m happy to go along with it" is fine.
   - *Social Distance*: Use more formal variants with new collaborators; casual or humorous versions suit close teams.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: In high-stakes decisions, avoid joking; use formal or semi-formal agreement formulas instead of playful "go along with" lines.
   - *Cultural Context*: In direct cultures, clear support ("I support your plan") may be expected; in more indirect cultures, "I’m happy to go along with your plan" can soften commitment.
   - *Medium*: In writing (emails, minutes), prefer "I support" or "I agree with"; "go along with" fits better in speech and informal chat.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "I’ll go along with it" in a tone that sounds resentful or passive-aggressive.
   - Using humorous versions in front of clients or leadership, which can sound like hidden criticism.
   - Overusing "go along with" instead of clearer verbs like "support", "approve", or "agree" in formal documentation.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some contexts, "go along with" may imply weaker support than "agree" or "support". Learners should be aware that it can sound like reluctant compliance if delivered with flat or hesitant intonation.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Team deciding between two designs → **Appropriate Variant**: "I’m happy to go along with your plan" (semi-formal, cooperative).
   - **Situation 2**: Formal written response to a proposal → **Appropriate Variant**: "I am prepared to support your plan." (formal, unambiguous support).
   - **Situation 3**: Close colleagues debating options → **Appropriate Variant**: "Okay, I’ll go along with your plan." (casual, low-stakes acceptance).
