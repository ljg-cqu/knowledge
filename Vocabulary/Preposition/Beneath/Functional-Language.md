   - Try looking beneath the surface (softer, more tentative)
   - You need to look beneath the surface (more directive)

   - Such actions are beneath you (more formal)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression performs face-saving for both parties—it criticizes while affirming the person's usual higher standards. It presupposes shared values about what's worthy or unworthy
