1. **Expression**: beneath the surface (type: collocation - transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Below the outer layer or visible exterior; not immediately apparent or visible
   - *Figurative*: Hidden from view; concealed beneath outward appearances; existing at a deeper, less obvious level
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: under the surface, below the visible layer, at a deeper level, hidden from view, not immediately apparent
   
   **Antonyms**: on the surface, visibly, apparently, obviously, at first glance
   
   **When to Use**: When discussing hidden aspects, underlying factors, deeper meanings, or concealed realities that aren't immediately visible; appropriate in both literal (physical) and figurative (abstract) contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When discussing completely obvious surface-level phenomena, or when "under the surface" would be more natural in physical contexts (swimming, diving)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - below the surface (more neutral, less literary)
   - just beneath the surface (emphasizes shallow depth)
   - deep beneath the surface (emphasizes significant depth)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Beneath" pairs naturally with "surface" due to spatial complementarity; "surface" defines the boundary that "beneath" crosses. The phrase has become conventionalized for both literal and metaphorical depth.
   
   **Root Analysis**: beneath (be- + neath "below") + surface (sur- "above" + face)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He seems happy, but I think there's a lot of anger beneath the surface.
   - The lake looks calm, but there are dangerous currents beneath the surface.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Beneath the surface of apparent agreement lie fundamental methodological disagreements.
   - The research examines psychological processes operating beneath the surface of conscious awareness.

2. **Expression**: beneath contempt (type: idiom - figurative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - So bad, despicable, or worthless that it doesn't even deserve contempt or scorn; too low to warrant even negative attention
   - *Literal meaning vs. Figurative*: Literally "below the level of contempt," figuratively means "utterly despicable"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: utterly despicable, completely worthless, beyond contempt, absolutely deplorable, not even worthy of scorn
   
   **Antonyms**: admirable, praiseworthy, respectable, worthy of respect
   
   **When to Use**: When expressing extreme disapproval or disgust; when indicating that something is so bad it falls below even the standard for contempt; in formal or literary contexts for strong condemnation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For mild disapproval (too strong), in casual conversation (overly formal), or when more measured criticism is appropriate
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - below contempt (less formal variant)
   - beneath one's contempt (personalized version)
   - utterly beneath contempt (intensified)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: The expression creates a paradox—something so bad it's "beneath" (lower than) even contempt. Originating in 19th century literary usage, it became conventionalized for extreme moral disapprobation. The phrase plays on vertical metaphors for moral judgment (high/low).
   
   **Root Analysis**: beneath (below) + contempt (Latin contemptus "despised")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The way they treated those refugees was beneath contempt.
   - Cheating on your disabled partner? That's just beneath contempt.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Such flagrant violations of human rights are beneath contempt and demand immediate sanction.
   - The defendant's behavior throughout this trial has been beneath contempt.

3. **Expression**: beneath one's dignity (type: idiom - figurative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Not worthy of someone's status or self-respect; too degrading or demeaning for someone to do given their position or character
   - *Literal meaning vs. Figurative*: Literally "below the level of one's dignity," figuratively means "too undignified or lowly for someone"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: below one's station, too demeaning, unworthy of one's position, beneath one's status, undignified for someone
   
   **Antonyms**: befitting one's dignity, worthy of one's status, appropriate for one's position
   
   **When to Use**: When indicating that an action would be too undignified or demeaning for someone given their status, position, or self-respect; can be used seriously or sarcastically
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When actions are genuinely appropriate regardless of status (criticizing someone for refusing honest work), or in very casual contexts where it sounds pompous
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - below one's dignity (slightly less formal)
   - beneath the dignity of (more formal, institutional)
   - considers it beneath their dignity (reporting someone's attitude)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: The expression emerged from aristocratic and class-based societies where certain activities were deemed inappropriate for people of high status. "Beneath" creates vertical hierarchy with "dignity" at the top. Modern usage can be either serious or ironically pompous.
   
   **Root Analysis**: beneath (below) + dignity (Latin dignitas "worthiness, honor")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He thinks taking out the trash is beneath his dignity or something.
   - She acts like talking to us is beneath her dignity—it's so annoying.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The ambassador considered such menial negotiations beneath the dignity of his office.

4. **Expression**: lie beneath (type: collocation - transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To be located in a position below something; to exist as a hidden or underlying reality under the surface
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred but not absolutely fixed)
   
   **Synonyms**: rest beneath, sit beneath, exist beneath, be located beneath, underlie
   
   **Antonyms**: lie above, sit atop, rest on top of
   
   **When to Use**: When describing the location of something physically below another thing, or metaphorically for underlying causes, hidden truths, or fundamental realities
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When active movement rather than static position is involved (use "move beneath"), or when "underlie" would be more precise in formal writing
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - lies hidden beneath (emphasizes concealment)
   - lies buried beneath (emphasizes depth/concealment)
   - lies deep beneath (emphasizes depth)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Lie" (meaning "to recline" or "to be situated") naturally combines with location prepositions. "Beneath" specifies the location as below/under, making this a high-frequency, natural partnership for describing both physical and abstract under-positions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: lie (Old English licgan "to recline") + beneath (below)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The real problem lies beneath all these symptoms we're seeing.
   - Treasure is supposed to lie beneath that old oak tree.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The fundamental principles of the theory lie beneath layers of technical notation.
   - Significant mineral deposits lie beneath the region's surface geology.

5. **Expression**: hidden beneath (type: collocation - transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Concealed below or under something; kept out of sight by being placed beneath a covering or surface
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common natural pairing)
   
   **Synonyms**: concealed beneath, buried beneath, obscured beneath, covered beneath, lying beneath unseen
   
   **Antonyms**: visible above, exposed on, displayed on, revealed above
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that something is deliberately or naturally concealed by being beneath something else; appropriate for both physical hiding and metaphorical concealment
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When emphasizing the hiding action rather than the location (use "hide beneath" as verb phrase), or when concealment is not beneath something
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - well hidden beneath (emphasizes thoroughness of concealment)
   - carefully hidden beneath (emphasizes deliberate concealment)
   - long hidden beneath (emphasizes duration)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Hidden" (concealed state) naturally pairs with "beneath" (below position) because below-position is a common means of concealment. The partnership emphasizes both the concealed state and the spatial relationship.
   
   **Root Analysis**: hidden (past participle of "hide") + beneath (below)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The spare key is hidden beneath the mat by the back door.
   - His real feelings are hidden beneath all that sarcasm.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Critical evidence remained hidden beneath bureaucratic obfuscation.
   - The true costs were hidden beneath complex financial instruments.

6. **Expression**: buried beneath (type: collocation - transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Covered completely by being placed under earth, debris, or other material; deeply concealed beneath layers
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly conventional pairing)
   
   **Synonyms**: entombed beneath, interred beneath, covered beneath, concealed beneath, submerged beneath
   
   **Antonyms**: exposed above, uncovered, unearthed, excavated from beneath
   
   **When to Use**: When describing complete coverage by earth or debris, or metaphorically for deeply suppressed emotions, forgotten information, or thoroughly concealed facts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing light or temporary coverage (use "covered beneath"), or when the burial metaphor is inappropriate
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - deeply buried beneath (emphasizes depth)
   - long buried beneath (emphasizes duration)
   - buried deep beneath (emphasizes significant depth)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Buried" specifically denotes complete coverage, typically by earth. "Beneath" specifies the spatial relationship as below the covering material. This partnership is conventional because burial inherently places things beneath a covering.
   
   **Root Analysis**: buried (past participle of "bury" from Old English byrgan) + beneath (below)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The time capsule is buried beneath that monument in the town square.
   - Her grief is buried beneath years of trying to move on.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Archaeological artifacts remain buried beneath multiple sedimentary strata.
   - The institution's founding principles became buried beneath layers of bureaucratic accretion.

7. **Expression**: scratch beneath the surface (type: idiom - semi-transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To investigate beyond superficial appearances; to examine something more deeply than initial observation reveals
   - *Literal meaning vs. Figurative*: Literally "to scrape the outer layer to see what's underneath," figuratively means "to investigate beyond initial appearances"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (conventionalized expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: dig deeper, look beyond appearances, investigate further, probe beneath the surface, examine more closely
   
   **Antonyms**: accept at face value, take superficially, judge by appearances, stay on the surface
   
   **When to Use**: When encouraging or describing investigation beyond obvious surface features; when suggesting that minimal investigation reveals hidden information
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When deep investigation is required (use "dig deep" instead), when surface understanding is adequate, or in contexts where the scratching metaphor seems too casual
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - scratch below the surface (less common variant)
   - barely scratch the surface (emphasizes minimal depth achieved)
   - just scratch beneath the surface (emphasizes minimal effort required)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: The metaphor of "scratching" implies light, superficial investigation—just enough to get past the surface. The idiom suggests that truth is barely concealed, requiring only minimal effort to reveal. First documented in English in the 1800s, it became a common expression for cursory investigation revealing hidden information.
   
   **Root Analysis**: scratch (imitative origin, light cutting) + beneath the surface (below outer layer)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you scratch beneath the surface, you'll see they have some serious financial problems.
   - Scratch beneath the surface and you'll find they're not so different from us.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - When one scratches beneath the surface of these claims, significant inconsistencies emerge.
   - Critical analysis requires scholars to scratch beneath the surface of conventional interpretations.

8. **Expression**: what lies beneath (type: fixed phrase - semi-transparent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The hidden reality, underlying cause, or concealed truth that exists below surface appearances; a question about hidden factors
   - *Fixedness*: medium-strong (conventionalized as a phrase, often used as title/heading)
   
   **Synonyms**: what's underneath, what's hidden, the underlying reality, what's below the surface, the concealed truth
   
   **Antonyms**: what's apparent, what's obvious, what's on the surface, what's visible
   
   **When to Use**: When investigating hidden factors, questioning surface appearances, or titling investigations into concealed realities; works as both a question and a thematic statement
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When surface-level information is sufficient, or when the phrase sounds overly dramatic for simple questions
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - what really lies beneath (emphasizes truth-seeking)
   - what lies hidden beneath (emphasizes concealment)
   - discovering what lies beneath (active investigation)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: The expression combines interrogative "what" with spatial verb "lies" and preposition "beneath" to create a semi-fixed phrase commonly used in titles, investigations, and philosophical inquiries. It gained prominence as a cultural phrase used in media titles and investigative contexts, becoming conventionalized for discussions of hidden realities.
   
   **Root Analysis**: what (interrogative) + lies (exists, is situated) + beneath (below)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You have to wonder what lies beneath all that confidence.
   - What lies beneath that calm surface? He's got to be stressed about something.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study examines what lies beneath the apparent correlation between variables.
   - Understanding what lies beneath observable behavior requires sophisticated analytical frameworks.

9. **Expression**: beneath notice (type: idiom - figurative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - So unimportant or trivial that it doesn't deserve attention; too insignificant to be worth noticing
   - *Literal meaning vs. Figurative*: Literally "below the threshold of notice," figuratively means "too trivial to pay attention to"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: too trivial to notice, not worth attention, beneath consideration, too insignificant, unworthy of notice
   
   **Antonyms**: worthy of attention, noteworthy, significant, important, deserving notice
   
   **When to Use**: In formal or literary contexts to indicate extreme triviality or insignificance; when dismissing something as unworthy of consideration
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual contexts (too formal), when the dismissal might be hurtful, or for matters that genuinely deserve attention
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - below notice (less formal variant)
   - entirely beneath notice (intensified)
   - scarcely beneath notice (marginally worthy)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: The expression uses vertical metaphor (beneath = lower status) combined with "notice" (attention, awareness) to create a dismissive idiom. Originating in formal 19th century usage, it suggests something is so low in importance it falls below the threshold of worthy attention.
   
   **Root Analysis**: beneath (below) + notice (Latin notitia "being known")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He acts like our opinions are totally beneath his notice.
   - *Typically not used in casual contexts*
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Such trivial objections are beneath notice and warrant no response.
   - The committee deemed the complaint beneath notice given more pressing concerns.

10. **Expression**: lurking beneath (type: collocation - transparent)
    **Meaning**: 
    - Waiting hidden in a position below something, often with threatening or ominous connotation; existing as a hidden threat or danger underneath
    - *Fixedness*: medium (common natural pairing)
    
    **Synonyms**: hiding beneath, lying in wait beneath, concealed beneath, waiting beneath, threatening from beneath
    
    **Antonyms**: visible above, openly present, clearly seen
    
    **When to Use**: When emphasizing hidden threat, danger, or mysterious presence beneath the surface; appropriate for both literal (physical) and figurative (abstract) threats
    
    **When NOT to Use**: For benign hiding without threat (use "hiding beneath"), or when the ominous connotation is inappropriate
    
    **Common Variations**: 
    - lurking just beneath (emphasizes proximity to surface)
    - lurking somewhere beneath (emphasizes uncertainty of location)
    - still lurking beneath (emphasizes persistence)
    
    **Why This Partnership**: 
    - *For collocation*: "Lurking" inherently suggests hidden threat or ominous presence. "Beneath" specifies the hiding location as below/under, making this a conventional pairing for describing threats, dangers, or mysteries hidden below the surface.
    
    **Root Analysis**: lurking (Middle English lurken "to hide, lie in wait") + beneath (below)
    
    **Examples [Casual]**: 
    - There's some serious anger lurking beneath that calm exterior.
    - You never know what might be lurking beneath the surface of that pond.
    
    **Examples [Formal]**: 
    - Significant systemic risks are lurking beneath the apparent market stability.
