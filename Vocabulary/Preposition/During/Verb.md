1. **Verb**: last
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Intransitive) To continue to exist or happen for a particular period of time; to endure throughout a duration
   - (Sense 2) To remain in good condition during a period; to survive or endure
   - Grammatically intransitive; often followed by time expressions
   
   **Synonyms**: continue, endure, persist, remain, go on

   **When to Use**: Essential for describing how long something continues or persists. Common in all registers when discussing duration. Natural with time expressions indicating how long.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with "last" meaning "final" (adjective) or "previous." Avoid in contexts where specific start/end times are more relevant than duration.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - last for hours
   - last throughout
   - last during the entire period
   - last the whole time
   - made to last
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Old English *læstan* (to follow, continue)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *læstan* (to continue, endure, follow a track) → Middle English *lasten* → Modern English "last" (verb). Different etymology from "last" (final), though both exist in modern English.

   **When to Use**: Common in formal, academic, and professional writing. Preferred in scientific and technical contexts. More formal than "happen."

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - occur during
   - naturally occur
   - frequently occur
   - occur simultaneously
   - occur throughout
   
   **Root Analysis**: oc- (toward) + -cur (run) from Latin

   **When to Use**: Essential for describing ongoing actions or states during a period. Common in all registers and contexts. Versatile verb for temporal continuity.

   **Common Phrases**:

   **Root Analysis**: From Old English *spannan* (to stretch, span)
