1. **Linking Word**: during (type: subordinating preposition/temporal marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Functions as a temporal marker that connects an event to a timeframe, establishing when something occurred in relation to another event or period
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship between two elements; situates one event within the timeframe of another
   
   **Synonyms**: throughout, while (with clause), in the course of, at the time of, over the course of
   
   **Antonyms**: before, after, prior to, following, outside of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "during" to establish temporal relationships in both simple and complex sentences. Essential for narrative sequencing, explanatory contexts, and establishing cause-effect relationships where timing matters. Appropriate across all registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use with duration expressions requiring "for" (for three hours, not during three hours). Cannot introduce a clause with a subject and verb (use "while" instead). Avoid in cases where "in" is the standard preposition (in summer, in 2020).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Main clause] + during + [noun/noun phrase]
     - Example: "The fire started during the night"
   - [Position]: Most commonly mid-sentence or sentence-final; occasionally sentence-initial for emphasis
     - Example: "During the investigation, new evidence emerged"
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial position; no comma in mid/final position unless part of larger punctuation structure
   - [Common errors to avoid]: 
     - Fragment: "During the meeting" (needs main clause)
     - Wrong preposition: "during three hours" (use "for")
     - With clause: "during he was sleeping" (use "while")
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin *dur-* (hard, lasting) + *-ing* (participial ending)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *durare* (to last, endure) → Old French *durant* (lasting, while) → Middle English *during* (14th century). Evolved from meaning "lasting" to indicating temporal simultaneity.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I always feel sleepy during afternoon meetings.
   - She called me during lunch, so I couldn't really talk.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - During the proceedings, all participants must observe proper courtroom decorum.
   - Significant technological advances occurred during the period under investigation.

2. **Linking Word**: during which (type: relative/compound connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Combines temporal preposition with relative pronoun to create complex sentences linking time periods with events
   - *Function*: Connects clauses by establishing temporal relationship; adds specificity to time references; creates more sophisticated sentence structures
   
   **Synonyms**: when (less formal), in which, throughout which, at which time, in the course of which
   
   **Antonyms**: before which, after which, until which
   
   **When to Use**: Preferred in formal and academic writing for connecting related temporal information. Creates more sophisticated, flowing prose. Useful when you need to provide additional information about a previously mentioned time period.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation (use "when" instead). Avoid overuse as it can make writing seem stilted. Not needed in simple constructions. Can sound pretentious in informal contexts.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [time period noun phrase] + during which + [relative clause]
     - Example: "The summer during which we traveled through Europe"
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence, connecting two clauses
   - [Punctuation]: Comma rules depend on restrictive vs. non-restrictive clause
     - Restrictive: "The period during which this occurred was significant" (no comma)
     - Non-restrictive: "2020, during which the pandemic began, was a challenging year" (commas)
   - [Common errors to avoid]:
     - Comma splice: joining independent clauses incorrectly
     - Overuse: every temporal reference doesn't need this construction
     - Informal context: "the time during which I ate lunch" (too formal; use "when")
   
   **Root Analysis**: *during* (from Latin *durare*) + *which* (from Old English *hwilc*, akin to "who")
   
   **Etymology**: Combination emerged in Middle English as relative clause constructions developed. Combines temporal preposition with relative pronoun for complex modification.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Do you remember that summer during which we barely saw any rain?
   - There was a brief period during which nobody could figure out what was wrong.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study examined the decade during which the most significant policy changes were implemented.
   - The researchers identified a critical window during which intervention proved most effective.

3. **Linking Word**: during which time (type: discourse marker/temporal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Extended temporal connector that explicitly emphasizes the duration or timeframe reference
   - *Function*: Connects discourse segments; signals transition to events within a referenced period; adds emphatic clarity to temporal relationships
   
   **Synonyms**: in which time, over which period, throughout which period, in the meantime, meanwhile (when referring to concurrent events)
   
   **Antonyms**: before then, after that, at other times
   
   **When to Use**: Useful in formal narration and exposition when you want to emphasize the temporal framework. Common in historical writing, legal documents, and formal reports. Helps organize chronological information clearly.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too wordy for casual speech. Avoid in contexts where simpler alternatives work equally well. Can sound bureaucratic or overly formal in everyday writing.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Time reference], during which time + [what happened]
     - Example: "He lived in Paris for five years, during which time he learned French"
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or mid-sentence after time reference
   - [Punctuation]: Typically preceded by comma; establishes temporal context for following information
   - [Common errors to avoid]:
     - Redundancy: "during which time period" (time is redundant)
     - Overuse: makes prose repetitive
     - Casual context: too formal for everyday conversation
   
   **Root Analysis**: *during* + *which* + *time* (Old English *tīma*)
   
   **Etymology**: Extended form of "during which" that developed in formal registers to add explicit temporal reference. More common in written than spoken English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She stayed with us for a month, during which time we got to know her pretty well.
   - They worked on the project for six months, during which time everything else was on hold.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The defendant was under surveillance for three weeks, during which time no suspicious activity was observed.
   - The medication trial lasted twelve months, during which time participants were monitored for adverse effects.
