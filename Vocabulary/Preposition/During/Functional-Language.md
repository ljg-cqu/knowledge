   **Antonyms**: Before [event], After [event], Outside of [event]
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to specify timing by reference to a known event or period. Useful for clarifying when something occurred, providing context, or establishing simultaneity. Common in narratives, explanations, and reports.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - During the [noun]
   - During [possessive] time as [role]
   - During which [additional information]
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This is a neutral, factual way to provide temporal context. It doesn't carry emotional weight or implication. Safe for all contexts. The choice of what event to reference can subtly emphasize connections.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, I see. So that's when it happened.
   - What else was going on during that time?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A: When did you meet Sarah? B: During my time at university. We were in the same program.
   - I lost my phone during the concert, so I couldn't take any photos.

2. **Functional Expression**: I was thinking during [event] that... (function: reflecting on past thoughts)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (softens the assertion)
   
   **Synonyms**: While [event] was happening, I thought..., It occurred to me during [event] that..., I realized during [event] that...
   
   **Antonyms**: I never thought that..., It didn't occur to me that...
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to share a past insight or observation while providing temporal context. Softens the statement by framing it as a past thought rather than current assertion. Useful for suggestions or gentle criticism.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not appropriate for formal written reports (too conversational). Avoid when you need to make strong, definitive statements. Don't use if the timing isn't actually relevant.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I was thinking during [event]...
   - It struck me during [event] that...
   - I couldn't help noticing during [event] that...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The phrase "I was thinking" is a hedging device that makes suggestions more tentative and less face-threatening. Adding temporal context with "during" makes it seem like a spontaneous observation rather than prepared criticism.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, interesting. What made you think that?
   - I had the same thought!
   - I see what you mean.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: When you want to defer a conversation to a more appropriate time. Useful for managing meeting flow, postponing difficult topics, or ensuring the right people are present. Shows consideration for timing and context.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not for genuinely urgent matters that need immediate attention. Avoid if it will seem like you're avoiding the issue. Don't use if the suggested time is inappropriate for the topic.

   - Why don't we talk about this during [event]?
   - Let's discuss this during [event], if that works
