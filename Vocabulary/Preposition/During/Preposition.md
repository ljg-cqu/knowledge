   **Root Analysis**: From Latin "durare" (to last, endure) → Old French "durant" (lasting) → Middle English "during"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *durare* (to last, continue, harden) → Old French *durant* (present participle of *durer*) → Middle English *during* (14th century). Originally meant "lasting, enduring" before evolving into a preposition indicating temporal simultaneity.
