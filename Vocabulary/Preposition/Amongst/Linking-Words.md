1. **Linking Word**: amongst other things (type: discourse marker - addition/exemplification)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A discourse marker used to introduce examples while indicating that the list is not exhaustive; signals additional unstated items exist
   - *Function*: Adds information while hedging completeness; creates cohesion between mentioned and unmentioned items
   
   **Synonyms**: among other things, including, for example, inter alia, to name a few
   
   **Antonyms**: specifically, only, exclusively, in particular
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or semi-formal writing to introduce examples without claiming exhaustiveness. Appropriate in academic writing, reports, presentations when you want to cite representative examples. Use when maintaining flexibility or avoiding over-commitment.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts requiring precision or completeness (legal documents, technical specs). Don't use if you've actually listed everything. Avoid when vagueness could undermine credibility. In American English, prefer "among other things."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + [object/complement], amongst other things
   - [Position]: typically sentence-final or mid-sentence as parenthetical insertion
   - [Punctuation]: preceded by comma when mid-sentence or sentence-final; can be set off by commas as parenthetical
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overuse creating vague impression; using when precision is expected
   
   **Root Analysis**: amongst (preposition) + other (determiner) + things (noun)
   
   **Etymology**: Phrasal construction combining "amongst" (Old English *onmang*) with "other things" - common in formal register since Middle English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I need to finish the report, email the team, and amongst other things, prep for tomorrow's meeting."
   - "She's good at math, science, and amongst other things, she plays piano really well."

   - "The study examined participant demographics, intervention outcomes, and amongst other things, long-term adherence rates."
   - "The committee will evaluate research productivity, teaching effectiveness, and amongst other things, service contributions to the institution."

2. **Linking Word**: amongst [group], [subject] [verb] (type: discourse marker - context setting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Sets contextual frame by establishing the group or category within which the following statement applies
   - *Function*: Provides scope limitation; creates cohesion by linking statement to specific context
   
   **Synonyms**: among [group], within [group], in [group]
   
   **Antonyms**: outside [group], beyond [group], excluding [group]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing to establish scope or context before making a claim. Appropriate in academic writing, research papers, formal reports when you need to limit generalizability. Particularly useful when contrasting different groups.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual writing where simpler constructions work better. Don't use when the scope is already obvious from context. Avoid overuse which creates unnecessarily complex sentences. In American English, strongly prefer "among."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Amongst [noun phrase], [independent clause]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial as dependent prepositional phrase
   - [Punctuation]: followed by comma before main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: sentence fragments; unclear referent for "amongst" phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: amongst (preposition indicating inclusion/membership)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English *onmang* (in the group/crowd of)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Amongst my friends, I'm probably the most organized one."

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where simpler structures suffice. Don't use when the construction creates awkward, overly complex sentences. Avoid when American English audience prefers "among."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + [verb] + not only [complement] but also amongst [group]
   - [Position]: correlative structure spans sentence
   - [Punctuation]: typically no comma before "but"; comma usage follows standard correlative conjunction rules
   - [Common errors to avoid]: parallelism failures; mixing formal "amongst" with casual vocabulary
   
   **Root Analysis**: correlative conjunction + preposition
   
   **Etymology**: Modern construction combining correlative conjunction (Latin origin) with "amongst" (Old English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: while among [group], whereas among [group], though within [group]
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly amongst, likewise amongst, just as amongst
   
   **When to Use**: Use in academic writing, comparative analysis, research papers when contrasting conditions across different groups. Appropriate in formal reports, policy analysis when showing variation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts with simpler alternatives available. Don't use when the contrast isn't meaningful or well-supported. Avoid in American English where "among" is standard.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: While/Whereas amongst [group A], [condition X], amongst [group B], [condition Y]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial dependent clause or mid-sentence contrast
   - [Punctuation]: comma after introductory dependent clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: unclear parallel structure; insufficient contrast to warrant construction
   
   **Root Analysis**: subordinating conjunction + preposition
   
   **Etymology**: Combining subordinating conjunctions (Old English *hwīl*, Latin-origin *whereas*) with "amongst"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: among both [groups], within both [groups], across [groups]
   
   **Antonyms**: neither amongst [group A] nor [group B], only amongst [one group]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing when emphasizing broad consensus, widespread phenomenon, or universal applicability across groups. Appropriate in academic writing, research synthesis, policy documents.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "in both groups" is clearer. Don't use when one group shows the phenomenon more strongly (use "especially amongst"). Avoid in American English contexts preferring "among."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject/phenomenon] + [verb] + both amongst [group A] and [group B]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence or end-sentence as complement
   - [Punctuation]: parallel structure typically without comma before "and"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: parallelism failures; listing more than two groups (use "amongst" multiple times or switch structures)
   
   **Root Analysis**: correlative determiner + preposition
   
   **Etymology**: Modern construction combining "both...and" (Old English *bā*, *and*) with "amongst"

   **Synonyms**: especially among, particularly in, most notably amongst, above all in
   
   **Antonyms**: generally amongst, broadly amongst, universally amongst
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing when specifying where a phenomenon is most pronounced or a claim is most applicable. Appropriate in research papers, reports when highlighting specific subgroups. Useful for nuanced claims.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when all groups show the phenomenon equally. Don't use as a hedge when you mean "only" or "exclusively." Avoid in casual contexts with simpler alternatives. In American English, prefer "among."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [General statement], particularly/especially amongst [specific group]
   - [Position]: sentence-final or mid-sentence as specification
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "particularly/especially" when it modifies entire preceding clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: contradicting an absolute claim made earlier; using without evidence of difference
