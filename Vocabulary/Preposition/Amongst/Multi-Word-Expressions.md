1. **Expression**: amongst other things (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A fixed phrase used to indicate that what has been mentioned is part of a larger, non-exhaustive list; implies there are additional items not specified
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed collocation - components rarely separated or substituted)
   
   **Synonyms**: among other things, inter alia, including but not limited to, to name a few, for example
   
   **Antonyms**: specifically, exclusively, only this, in particular
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts when providing examples without claiming completeness. Common in academic writing, business reports, professional communication. Appropriate when hedging or maintaining flexibility.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "and other stuff" or "and things like that" are more natural. Don't use when you need to be comprehensive or precise. Avoid in contexts where vagueness undermines credibility. American English speakers prefer "among other things."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - among other things (more common, especially in American English)
   - amongst other factors/reasons/issues (domain-specific)
   - and other things (very casual)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Amongst" naturally pairs with "other" to indicate non-exhaustive membership in a set. "Things" serves as a general placeholder noun. This combination has high frequency in formal registers and has become a fixed expression through conventional usage in academic and professional discourse.
   
   **Root Analysis**: amongst (preposition, Old English *onmang*) + other (determiner, Old English *ōther*) + things (noun, Old English *þing*)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I've got to pay bills, call my mom, and amongst other things, figure out what's wrong with my car."
   - "The hotel offers spa services, a gym, and amongst other things, a rooftop pool."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The research agenda addresses methodological rigor, theoretical innovation, and amongst other things, practical applicability of findings."
   - "The curriculum encompasses quantitative methods, qualitative approaches, and amongst other things, mixed-methods research design."

2. **Expression**: rank amongst the best/top/most [adjective] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A verb + preposition + noun phrase collocation indicating high position or status within a category or group
   - *Fixedness*: medium (verb + preposition combination is strong; the superlative adjective varies)
   
   **Synonyms**: be among the best, count among the top, be one of the most, number amongst the leading
   
   **Antonyms**: rank amongst the worst, be among the poorest, fall below average
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal contexts to make comparative claims about quality, status, or achievement. Common in academic writing, professional evaluations, marketing materials, awards citations. Appropriate when establishing credentials or making prestige claims.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "is one of the best" is more natural. Don't use without supporting evidence in professional contexts. Avoid in American English where "rank among" is strongly preferred. Can sound pretentious if overused.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - rank among the best (American English preference)
   - be amongst the leading
   - count amongst the most important
   - number amongst the top performers
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Rank" as a verb commonly collocates with prepositions indicating group membership ("among/amongst"). The superlative construction ("the best/top/most X") naturally follows to specify the elite subgroup. This partnership reflects conventional usage in evaluative discourse.
   
   **Root Analysis**: rank (Old French *ranc*, row/line) + amongst (Old English *onmang*) + superlative construction
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "This place definitely ranks amongst the best pizza joints in the city."
   - "She'd rank amongst the top five players on the team, for sure."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Dr. Martinez's contributions rank amongst the most influential works in contemporary cognitive psychology."

3. **Expression**: consensus amongst [group] (type: collocation - noun + preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A noun + preposition collocation indicating general agreement within a specified group
   - *Fixedness*: medium (noun + preposition is preferred partnership; can substitute "among")
   
   **Synonyms**: agreement among, consensus within, accord amongst, shared understanding within
   
   **Antonyms**: disagreement amongst, division among, discord within
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal professional, academic, or diplomatic contexts when describing collective decision-making or shared views. Common in research papers, committee reports, policy discussions. Appropriate when emphasizing group unity or collective wisdom.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when referring to only two parties (use "between"). Don't use when there's actually significant disagreement (overstates unity). Avoid in casual contexts where "everyone agrees" is clearer. American English prefers "consensus among."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - consensus among (American English preference)
   - agreement amongst
   - broad/strong/general consensus amongst
   - emerging consensus amongst
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Consensus" (shared agreement) semantically requires a group, making it naturally collocate with prepositions indicating group membership. "Amongst" specifies the group within which agreement exists. High co-occurrence frequency in formal discourse makes this a strong collocation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: consensus (Latin *consensus*, agreement) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "There's pretty solid consensus amongst the group that we should postpone."
   - "I think there's consensus amongst all of us that this approach won't work."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: split among, allocate to, apportion amongst, distribute to, share between
   
   **Antonyms**: consolidate, centralize, keep from, withhold from
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts involving resource allocation, task assignment, or distribution decisions. Common in project management, financial planning, collaborative work settings. Appropriate when emphasizing fairness or collective participation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when unequal distribution is appropriate. Don't use when referring to only two parties (use "between"). Avoid in casual contexts where "split it up" is more natural. American English prefers "divide/distribute among."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - divide among (American English preference)
   - distribute amongst ourselves/themselves
   - share equally amongst
   - split amongst the team
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Verbs of distribution (divide, distribute, share) semantically entail multiple recipients, naturally requiring prepositions indicating group membership. "Amongst" specifies the recipient group. This is a conventional collocation in both formal and informal registers.
   
   **Root Analysis**: divide (Latin *dividere*), distribute (Latin *distribuere*), share (Old English *scearu*) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Let's just divide these tasks amongst ourselves and get them done."
   - "We'll share the costs amongst everyone who's going on the trip."

   **Synonyms**: concealed among, obscured within, lost in, buried in, hidden within
   
   **Antonyms**: prominent amongst, visible amongst, standing out from
   
   **When to Use**: Use in both formal and informal contexts when describing difficulty finding something within a larger set. Common in archival research, literary description, everyday search scenarios. Appropriate for both literal and figurative concealment.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the item is easily accessible or prominent. Don't use when "in" would be more precise and natural. American English speakers may prefer "hidden among" or "lost in."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - hidden among (American English preference)
   - buried amongst the papers/files/documents
   - lost amongst the crowd/collection
   - concealed amongst
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Participles indicating concealment or difficulty locating (hidden, lost, buried) naturally collocate with "amongst" which implies being surrounded by or within a group/collection. The preposition emphasizes the item's embedding within the larger set.
   
   **Root Analysis**: hidden (Old English *hȳdan*), lost (Old English *losian*), buried (Old English *byrgan*) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "My keys were buried amongst all the junk on my desk."
   - "The small café is kind of hidden amongst the bigger shops on that street."

   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts to describe prevalence of practices, beliefs, or preferences within groups. Common in research papers, market analysis, sociological description. Appropriate for both academic and professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when referring to only two individuals. Don't use without evidence in academic contexts. American English speakers strongly prefer "popular/common among."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - popular among (American English preference)
   - common amongst certain groups/demographics
   - widespread amongst the population
   - prevalent amongst
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Adjectives indicating frequency or prevalence (popular, common, widespread) semantically imply a reference group, naturally collocating with prepositions of group membership. "Amongst" specifies the relevant population. High co-occurrence in descriptive and analytical writing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: popular (Latin *popularis*), common (Latin *communis*), widespread (English compound) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "That restaurant is really popular amongst college students."
   - "This kind of thinking is pretty common amongst people in our generation."

   **Antonyms**: typical amongst, common among, ordinary within
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal contexts to emphasize exceptional status or distinction within a category. Common in academic writing, awards citations, comparative analysis. Appropriate when highlighting uniqueness requires reference to comparison group.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when claiming absolute uniqueness without group reference (use simply "unique"). Don't use in casual contexts where "different from" is clearer. Avoid in American English where "among" is standard.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - unique among (American English preference)
   - alone amongst [group] in [characteristic]
   - outstanding amongst one's peers
   - stands alone amongst
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Adjectives of distinctiveness (alone, unique, outstanding) gain meaning through implicit comparison, naturally requiring prepositions that establish the reference group. "Amongst" specifies the comparison set within which the distinction holds.
   
   **Root Analysis**: alone (Middle English *al one*), unique (Latin *unicus*), outstanding (English stand + out) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)

   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts describing information flow, document distribution, or rumor spread. Common in organizational communication, academic contexts, sociological description. Appropriate for both official and unofficial channels.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when describing controlled, directed communication (use "distribute to" or "send to"). Don't use when source and method should be specified. American English prefers "circulate/spread among."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - circulate among (American English preference)
   - spread rapidly/quickly amongst
   - circulate widely amongst
   - pass amongst the group
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Verbs of diffusion and spread (circulate, spread) semantically entail multiple recipients and movement through space, naturally collocating with prepositions indicating group membership. "Amongst" specifies the population through which the spread occurs.
   
   **Root Analysis**: circulate (Latin *circulare*, move in circle), spread (Old English *sprǣdan*) + amongst (Old English *onmang*)
