   **When to Use**: Use "towards" to express movement, direction, proximity in time, attitudes/feelings about something, or contribution to a goal. British English prefers "towards" while American English uses "toward" (without 's').
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with "to" when indicating a destination (reached vs. direction). Don't use with verbs that already contain directional meaning (e.g., "approach towards" is redundant).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: towards the end, towards the future, towards midnight, towards the goal
   - **Verb + prep**: move towards, work towards, head towards, lean towards, turn towards, look towards
   - **Adjective + prep**: hostile towards, friendly towards, sympathetic towards, positive towards
   - **Noun + prep**: attitude towards, approach towards, movement towards, steps towards, contribution towards
   
   **Root Analysis**: to (Old English preposition) + ward (direction suffix) + s (adverbial genitive)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English tōweard (in the direction of) → Middle English toward/towardes → Modern English towards. The 's' is an adverbial genitive marker common in directional words.
