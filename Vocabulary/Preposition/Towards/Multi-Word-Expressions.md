1. **Expression**: work towards (type: collocation - verb + preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To make efforts directed at achieving or obtaining something; to strive progressively to reach a goal or objective
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: strive for, work toward (American English), aim for, pursue, work to achieve
   
   **Antonyms**: work against, abandon, give up on, move away from
   
   **When to Use**: Professional, educational, and goal-oriented contexts. Emphasizes ongoing process and effort rather than immediate achievement. Common in progress reports, personal development, organizational strategy.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When goal has been achieved (use past tense "worked towards" or "achieved"). Avoid when no actual effort is being made. Don't use for physical movement (use "move towards").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - working towards (progressive form, ongoing)
   - worked towards (past tense, completed effort)
   - continue to work towards (emphasizes persistence)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Work" emphasizes effort/labor, "towards" emphasizes directionality and goal-orientation. The partnership is semantically compatible—effort requires direction. Extremely high co-occurrence frequency in professional and academic English. Alternative prepositions ("work at," "work on," "work for") have different meanings, making "towards" specifically encode progressive goal-directed effort.
   
   **Root Analysis**: work (Old English weorc) + towards (Old English tōweard, "in direction of")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm working towards getting my driver's license this summer.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - moving towards (progressive, ongoing)
   - moved towards (past, completed movement)
   - make a move towards (initiate movement)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Move" is the basic verb of position change; "towards" specifies directionality. Natural semantic fit for any directed motion—physical or abstract. One of the most fundamental directional collocations in English. The partnership is reinforced by spatial cognition metaphors underlying abstract reasoning (ideas as spaces, change as movement).
   
   **Root Analysis**: move (Latin movere, "to move") + towards (Old English tōweard)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's move towards the exit before it gets too crowded.

   **When to Use**: Formal discussions, surveys, research, opinion-gathering, describing perspectives or dispositions. Common in social sciences, psychology, organizational behavior, policy analysis.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual contexts where "feelings about" or "what you think of" sound more natural. Avoid when asking for factual information rather than evaluative opinions.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - attitudes towards (plural)
   - positive/negative attitude towards
   - changing attitude towards
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Attitude" inherently involves a psychological orientation or disposition, and "towards" naturally expresses the direction of that orientation. Strong conventional partnership in academic and professional English. Alternative prepositions ("attitude about," "attitude to") exist but "towards" is standard in formal English, especially British English. The collocation reflects conceptual metaphor: EVALUATION IS SPATIAL ORIENTATION.
   
   **Root Analysis**: attitude (Latin aptitudo via Italian attitudine, "fitness, posture") + towards
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - What's your attitude towards trying new foods?

   **Common Variations**: 
   - steps towards (plural, multiple actions)
   - first/next/final step towards
   - significant/important/bold step towards
   - take a step towards / take steps towards
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Step" metaphorically represents one unit of progress in a journey. "Towards" provides the directional target. The partnership leverages PROGRESS IS FORWARD MOTION metaphor central to English conceptual system. "Steps" implies journey isn't complete—still moving towards destination. Very high frequency in strategic and planning discourse.
   
   **Root Analysis**: step (Old English stæpe, "footstep") + towards
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - looking towards (progressive)
   - look towards the future
   - look towards [person/entity] for [help/guidance]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Look" is basic perception verb; "towards" adds directionality—both physical and metaphorical. The partnership extends naturally from physical vision to abstract attention/expectation through conceptual metaphor: ATTENTION IS VISION, FUTURE IS AHEAD. Strongly conventionalized for future-oriented statements.
   
   **Root Analysis**: look (Old English lōcian) + towards
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm looking towards graduation and then hopefully getting a job.

   - make progress towards
   - significant/substantial/steady progress towards
   - lack of progress towards
   - measure progress towards
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Progress" inherently implies forward movement; "towards" specifies the destination or goal. Semantic compatibility is perfect—progress without direction is meaningless. Extremely common in professional, academic, and project management discourse. The partnership reinforces GOALS ARE DESTINATIONS metaphor. Alternative constructions ("progress in," "progress on") have subtly different meanings focusing on domain rather than direction.
   
   **Root Analysis**: progress (Latin progressus, "advance, progress") + towards
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're making good progress towards finishing the project.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - leaning towards (progressive, current inclination)
   - lean more towards (comparative preference)
   - heavily lean towards (stronger preference)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Literal meaning (body leaning physically towards something) → Figurative meaning (mental/emotional inclination). The metaphor is transparent: physical leaning suggests gravitational pull or attraction, mapped onto preference/tendency. Common spatial-to-abstract metaphor in English. Medium fixedness—meaning is partly predictable from components but conventionalized as preferred expression for tentative preference.
   
   **Root Analysis**: lean (Old English hlinian, "recline, bend") + towards
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm leaning towards the blue one, but I'm not totally sure yet.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - shift towards [noun/gerund]
   - significant/gradual/dramatic shift towards
   - shift in attitude/focus/strategy towards
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Shift" implies change in position or direction; "towards" specifies the new direction. Strong semantic compatibility for describing transitions. Widely used in professional discourse about organizational, market, or societal changes. The partnership emphasizes both the change (shift) and the destination/goal (towards X), making it ideal for strategic communication about transitions.
