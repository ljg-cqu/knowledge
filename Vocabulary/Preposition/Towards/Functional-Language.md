   **Antonyms**: We should maintain our current focus, We need to shift away from [area]
   
   **When to Use**: Strategic discussions, priority-setting meetings, when current focus isn't yielding results, change management contexts, resource allocation decisions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When suggesting complete abandonment of current priorities without acknowledgment, very casual settings, when "let's try" would be more collaborative than "we need to."

   - It's time to shift our focus towards [area] (more emphatic)
   - Perhaps we should refocus towards [area] (more diplomatic)

   - What are your feelings towards [topic]? (more emotional focus)
   - What's the general attitude towards [topic]? (asking about group opinion)

   **When to Use**: Meetings, collaborative planning, motivating action, proposing initiatives, when consensus for change exists but action hasn't started. Signals readiness to move from discussion to implementation.
