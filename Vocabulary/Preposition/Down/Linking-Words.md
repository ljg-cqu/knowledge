1. **Linking Word**: down to (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates extent or limitation; introduces the specific detail or extent to which something applies
   - *Function*: Marks comprehensiveness and thoroughness; shows that something includes even minor details
   
   **Synonyms**: including, even including, as far as, extending to
   
   **Antonyms**: excluding, except for, up to but not including
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing thoroughness or comprehensiveness; showing attention to detail; appropriate in analytical and descriptive contexts across registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly emphatic; don't overuse when simple "including" would suffice
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main statement], down to [specific detail]
   - [Position]: typically follows main clause as additional specification
   - [Punctuation]: usually preceded by comma when adding detail
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse with "up to" (which can mean "as many as" but not including)
   
   **Root Analysis**: down (to lowest level) + to (extent marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Prepositional phrase extended to discourse function → emphasizes thoroughness by indicating inclusion of lowest/smallest details
