1. **Expression**: welcome aboard (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A greeting used when someone boards a vehicle or joins a team/organization
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed expression used as formulaic greeting)
   
   **Synonyms**: welcome, come on in, glad to have you, pleased you've joined
   
   **Antonyms**: farewell, goodbye, see you later, so long
   
   **When to Use**: Use as a greeting when someone physically boards a vehicle (ship, plane, train) or metaphorically joins a team, company, or project. Appropriate in both transportation and business contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the joining is involuntary or unwelcome. Don't use in extremely formal diplomatic contexts where more elaborate greetings are expected. Not appropriate for departures.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Welcome aboard! (enthusiastic, with exclamation)
   - Welcome aboard, [name]. (personalized)
   - We'd like to welcome [name] aboard. (third-person announcement)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Welcome" and "aboard" have strong conventional pairing in both nautical tradition and modern business metaphor. The phrase combines hospitality (welcome) with journey/membership (aboard), creating a warm, inclusive greeting that emphasizes shared venture.
   
   **Root Analysis**: welcome (Old English "wilcuma" = desired arrival) + aboard (on board), maritime greeting extended to all contexts of joining
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Welcome aboard! Let me show you to your seat.
   - Hey, welcome aboard the team! We're excited to have you.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Welcome aboard, Ambassador. We are honored to host you on this voyage.
   - The board of directors would like to welcome Dr. Martinez aboard as Chief Technology Officer.

2. **Expression**: all aboard (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Traditional announcement that a vehicle is about to depart and everyone should board immediately
   - *Fixedness*: strong (traditional fixed expression from railroad culture)
   
   **Synonyms**: everyone on, time to board, final call, last call for boarding
   
   **Antonyms**: all off, time to disembark, everyone out
   
   **When to Use**: Use as a traditional departure announcement on trains, boats, buses, or tour vehicles. Also used playfully to signal the start of an activity or journey.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not standard for aircraft (use proper safety announcements). Avoid in serious emergency situations requiring clear instructions. Too casual for very formal ceremonial contexts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - All aboard! (exclamatory)
   - All aboard who's coming aboard! (emphatic, playful)
   - All aboard the [destination] express! (specific route)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: Historic railroad conductor's call, dating to early railway era. The repetition of "all" creates urgency and inclusiveness. Fixed by cultural tradition and remains recognizable across English-speaking contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: all (everyone) + aboard (on the vehicle), formulaic call to action from transportation tradition
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - All aboard! We're leaving for the beach in two minutes!
   - All aboard the party bus! Next stop: downtown!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All aboard for Boston South Station. Train departing in three minutes.
   - All aboard, ladies and gentlemen. Our harbor tour will begin momentarily.

3. **Expression**: get aboard / climb aboard (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To board or enter a vehicle, especially a large vehicle like a ship, train, or bus
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred pairing, natural collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: board, get on, embark, step aboard, go aboard
   
   **Antonyms**: get off, disembark, exit, leave
   
   **When to Use**: Use for the physical action of boarding vehicles, especially in informal to neutral contexts. "Climb aboard" implies physical effort (steps, ladders). "Get aboard" is more general.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use "get aboard" for small vehicles like cars (use "get in"). Avoid "climb aboard" when no climbing is involved. Not appropriate for buildings or stationary structures.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - get aboard quickly
   - climb aboard carefully
   - help someone get aboard
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Get" + "aboard" creates natural action phrase. "Climb" pairs with "aboard" when boarding requires physical effort (gangways, ladders). High frequency of co-occurrence in transportation contexts strengthens the partnership.
   
   **Root Analysis**: get/climb (action verbs) + aboard (location/direction), creating motion-toward-vehicle expression
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Come on, get aboard before the train leaves!
   - Just climb aboard and find a seat anywhere.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Passengers are requested to get aboard through the forward entrance.
   - Please exercise caution when climbing aboard in inclement weather.

4. **Expression**: come aboard (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To board a vehicle or join an organization/team (both literal and metaphorical)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common pairing with both literal and figurative meanings)
   
   **Synonyms**: join us, board, get aboard, sign on, join the team
   
   **Antonyms**: leave, depart, resign, exit, step down
   
   **When to Use**: Use both literally for boarding vehicles and metaphorically for joining teams or organizations. Very versatile expression appropriate in casual to formal contexts depending on framing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts where the joining is clearly unwelcome or involuntary. Don't use for casual, temporary participation (use "join" instead).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - come aboard as [role]
   - invited to come aboard
   - decided to come aboard
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Come" (motion toward speaker) + "aboard" (location) creates invitation-like quality. Very high semantic compatibility—"come" implies welcome, "aboard" implies shared journey. Extended metaphorically to business/organizations naturally.
   
   **Root Analysis**: come (move toward) + aboard (onto vehicle/into group), emphasizing approach and arrival
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Come aboard whenever you're ready!
   - She came aboard as our new designer last month.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Dr. Williams has agreed to come aboard as Senior Research Consultant.
   - Distinguished guests are invited to come aboard at their convenience.

5. **Expression**: bring [someone] aboard (type: collocation)

   **When to Use**: Use in business and organizational contexts when discussing recruitment, hiring, or convincing someone to join. Implies both hiring and gaining commitment/alignment.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too informal for formal HR documentation (use "recruit" or "hire"). Avoid when discussing involuntary assignments or unwanted additions.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - bring [name] aboard for [project/role]
   - bringing new talent aboard
   - need to bring someone aboard
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Bring" (causative action) + "aboard" (to state of membership) creates strong business metaphor. Implies agency and intentionality in recruitment. The maritime metaphor suggests joining a journey/mission, not just employment.
   
   **Root Analysis**: bring (cause to come) + aboard (into the group/vehicle), emphasizing active recruitment
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We should bring Marcus aboard for this project—he's perfect for it.
   - They're bringing three new developers aboard next month.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee recommends bringing Dr. Chen aboard as a strategic advisor.
   - We are pleased to bring Ms. Johnson aboard as Chief Financial Officer.

6. **Expression**: take [something] aboard (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To load cargo, supplies, or passengers onto a ship or aircraft; to accept or understand information (metaphorical)
   - *Fixedness*: medium (standard maritime/aviation collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: load, embark, take on, accept (for metaphorical sense), understand (for metaphorical sense)
   
   **Antonyms**: unload, discharge, offload, reject (metaphorical)
   
   **When to Use**: Use literally for loading cargo or passengers onto vehicles, especially maritime and aviation contexts. Metaphorically used for accepting information or feedback (though less common than "take on board").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For metaphorical sense, "take on board" is more standard than "take aboard." Don't use for small vehicles where "put in" would be more natural.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - take cargo aboard
   - take passengers aboard
   - take on board (more common for metaphorical sense)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Take" (accept, receive) + "aboard" (onto vehicle) creates standard maritime/aviation terminology. High frequency in shipping and transportation industries. Semantic compatibility between accepting/receiving and bringing onto vehicle.
   
   **Root Analysis**: take (receive, accept) + aboard (onto vehicle), emphasizing loading process
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We can take about twenty people aboard this boat.
   - They're taking supplies aboard before we leave.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The vessel will take cargo aboard at the Port of Rotterdam.
   - The aircraft is authorized to take 156 passengers aboard for this flight.

7. **Expression**: man overboard (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Emergency call indicating someone has fallen off a ship into the water; requires immediate rescue response
   - *Fixedness*: strong (traditional maritime emergency phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: person overboard (gender-neutral modern variant), crew overboard, sailor overboard
   
   **Antonyms**: all hands accounted for, everyone aboard, crew complete
   
   **When to Use**: Use as emergency call on ships and boats when someone falls into water. Triggers specific rescue protocols. Also used figuratively (humorously) for being lost or abandoned in non-maritime contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use humorously in actual maritime emergencies. Modern usage often prefers gender-neutral "person overboard." Don't use for non-water emergencies.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Man overboard! (emergency call)
   - Person overboard (gender-neutral)
   - Man overboard drill (practice exercise)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Historic maritime emergency call, standardized for immediate recognition. Fixed by safety protocols—any variation could cause confusion during emergencies. "Man" (person/sailor) + "overboard" (off the ship into water) creates urgent, specific meaning.
   
   **Root Analysis**: man (person, traditional gender-nonspecific nautical term) + overboard (off the ship), maritime emergency terminology
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We did a man overboard drill this morning—it was pretty intense.
   - I feel like man overboard at this party; I don't know anyone!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Upon hearing "man overboard," all crew members must execute standard rescue procedures immediately.
   - The vessel conducted mandatory man overboard training as required by maritime safety regulations.

8. **Expression**: on board / onboard (type: collocation/compound)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Located on or in a vehicle; participating in or supporting a plan (metaphorical)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common, note spelling varies: "on board" for literal, "onboard" for adjectival)
   
   **Synonyms**: aboard, on the vehicle (literal), in agreement, in support, committed (metaphorical)
   
   **Antonyms**: off the vehicle, ashore (literal), opposed, against, not in agreement (metaphorical)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on board" (two words) as prepositional phrase or metaphorically for agreement. Use "onboard" (one word) as adjective for equipment/systems or metaphorically as adjective. Very versatile in business and transportation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse spelling: "on board" (phrase) vs. "onboard" (adjective). Avoid overusing metaphorically when simple "agree" would be clearer.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - get on board (join, agree)
   - everyone on board (literal or metaphorical)
   - onboard computer (adjective, one word)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "On" (position) + "board" (deck/vehicle) creates standard locative expression. Extended metaphorically to mean "in agreement" through journey/team metaphor. Extremely high frequency in both literal and metaphorical usage.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (position) + board (ship's deck/vehicle), primary expression for being on a vehicle
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Are you on board with leaving at 6 AM?
   - There are snacks on board if anyone's hungry.
