1. **Preposition**: aboard (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* On or onto a ship, aircraft, train, or other vehicle
   - *(Abstract)* Participating in or part of an organization, project, or team
   
   **Synonyms**: on (in context of vehicles), on board (in context of transport), in (in context of participation)
   
   **Antonyms**: off, ashore (for maritime contexts), outside (for participation contexts)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "aboard" when referring to being on a mode of transportation (ships, planes, trains, buses) or metaphorically when someone joins a team or project. Common in nautical, aviation, and business contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "aboard" for stationary locations (buildings, rooms) or for ground-level vehicles like cars or bicycles in everyday speech. Avoid using it when "on" or "in" would sound more natural for the context (e.g., *"aboard a car" is incorrect; use "in a car").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: aboard the ship, aboard the plane, aboard the train, welcome aboard
   - **Verb + prep**: get aboard, climb aboard, come aboard, go aboard, step aboard
   - **Adjective + prep**: safely aboard, already aboard
   - **Noun + prep**: passengers aboard, crew aboard, everyone aboard
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + board (ship's deck/side) = on board
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from "a-" (on) + "board" (ship's plank/side); originally nautical term meaning "on the deck/side of a ship," later extended to all vehicles
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Hey, everyone's already aboard the bus. Hurry up!
   - Welcome aboard! Glad to have you on the team.
