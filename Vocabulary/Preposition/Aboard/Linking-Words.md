1. **Linking Word**: once aboard (type: temporal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - After the action of boarding has been completed; after getting onto a vehicle or joining a group
   - *Function*: Temporal sequence connector indicating the completion of boarding as a prerequisite for subsequent actions
   
   **Synonyms**: after boarding, upon boarding, when aboard, after getting on
   
   **Antonyms**: before boarding, prior to embarkation, until boarding
   
   **When to Use**: Use to connect the boarding action with subsequent events or instructions. Common in travel instructions, safety briefings, and procedural contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts where "aboard" would be unnatural (buildings, cars). Don't use when simple "after" or "when" would be clearer for general audiences.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Once aboard, [independent clause describing subsequent action]
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial with comma, or mid-sentence after subject
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "once aboard" when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Omitting comma in sentence-initial position, using with inappropriate vehicles
   
   **Root Analysis**: once (at the moment when) + aboard (on the vehicle) = at the moment of being on the vehicle
   
   **Etymology**: Combination of temporal adverb "once" (Old English "ānes" = one time, at one time) with "aboard" (on board), creating temporal transition
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Once aboard, just find any empty seat and relax.
   - Once aboard the boat, we'll head straight for the island.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Once aboard the aircraft, passengers must comply with all crew instructions.
   - Once aboard, participants will receive a comprehensive briefing on safety procedures.

2. **Linking Word**: upon boarding / upon coming aboard (type: temporal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At the moment of boarding; immediately when entering a vehicle or vessel
   - *Function*: Formal temporal connector indicating simultaneity or immediate sequence with the boarding action
   
   **Synonyms**: when boarding, as soon as boarding, immediately after boarding, once aboard
   
   **Antonyms**: before boarding, prior to boarding, after departing
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal instructions, regulations, or announcements to specify timing relative to boarding. Common in official transportation, safety, and procedural documents.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for casual speech—use "when you get on" instead. Don't use in contexts where boarding isn't involved.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Upon boarding, [subject] [verb] / [Subject] [verb] upon boarding
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "upon boarding"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Overusing in casual contexts, fragments without main clause
   
   **Root Analysis**: upon (immediately at, formal "on") + boarding (act of getting onto vehicle) = at the moment of getting onto vehicle
   
   **Etymology**: "Upon" (Old English "uppan" = on, formal variant of "on") + "boarding" (from "board"), creating formal temporal marker
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Upon boarding, you'll see the restrooms on your right.
   - Check your ticket upon boarding the bus.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Upon boarding, all passengers must present valid identification to crew members.
   - Passengers are required to turn off electronic devices upon boarding the aircraft.

3. **Linking Word**: before boarding / prior to boarding (type: temporal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At any time before the action of getting onto a vehicle or vessel
   - *Function*: Temporal connector establishing sequence, indicating actions that must occur before boarding
   
   **Synonyms**: before getting on, prior to embarkation, ahead of boarding, in advance of boarding
   
   **Antonyms**: after boarding, once aboard, upon boarding, following embarkation
   
   **When to Use**: Use to specify prerequisites or preparations needed before entering a vehicle. Common in travel instructions, safety requirements, and procedural guidelines.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use "prior to boarding" in casual conversation (sounds overly formal). Avoid when "before leaving" or "before departing" would be clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Before boarding, [imperative/instruction] / [Action] before boarding
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "before boarding"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "boarding" (getting on) with "boarding" (accommodation)
   
   **Root Analysis**: before (earlier than) + boarding (act of getting onto) = earlier than getting onto
   
   **Etymology**: "Before" (Old English "beforan" = in front of, earlier than) + "boarding," creating clear temporal precedence
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Make sure you grab some snacks before boarding.
   - Everyone needs to use the restroom before boarding—there isn't one on the boat.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All passengers must complete check-in procedures before boarding.
   - Prior to boarding, guests are requested to review the safety guidelines provided.

4. **Linking Word**: while aboard / whilst aboard (type: temporal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the time of being on a vehicle, vessel, or part of an organization
   - *Function*: Temporal connector indicating duration, actions or states that occur during the period of being aboard
   
   **Synonyms**: during the journey, when on board, throughout the voyage, during transit
   
   **Antonyms**: before boarding, after disembarking, when not aboard
   
   **When to Use**: Use to specify rules, behaviors, or events that apply during the time spent on a vehicle or as part of a team. Common in regulations, safety instructions, and guidelines.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Whilst" is British formal; use "while" in American English. Don't use when "during" would be simpler and clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: While aboard, [subject] [verb] / [Subject] [verb] while aboard
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "while aboard"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Overusing in short contexts where "on" would suffice
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (during the time that) + aboard (on the vehicle) = during the time on the vehicle
   
   **Etymology**: "While" (Old English "hwīl" = period of time) + "aboard," creating temporal duration marker
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - While aboard, feel free to move around the cabin.
   - You can't use your phone while aboard this flight.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

5. **Linking Word**: after boarding / following embarkation (type: temporal connector)

   **Antonyms**: before boarding, prior to boarding, until boarding
   
   **When to Use**: Use to describe events, procedures, or instructions that occur after passengers or crew have boarded. Common in procedural documents and travel information.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Following embarkation" is very formal—avoid in casual contexts. Don't use when discussing non-transportation contexts.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: After boarding, [action/event occurs]
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "after boarding"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "after boarding" when you mean "after departure"
   
   **Root Analysis**: after (subsequent to) + boarding (getting onto vehicle) = subsequent to getting onto vehicle
   
   **Etymology**: "After" (Old English "æfter" = following in time) + "boarding," creating clear temporal sequence
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After boarding, we'll wait about ten minutes before leaving.
   - The crew will explain everything after boarding is complete.
