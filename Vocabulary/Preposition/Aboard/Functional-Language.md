1. **Functional Expression**: Welcome aboard [name/role] (function: welcoming/greeting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formulaic expression used to greet someone who is joining a team, organization, or vehicle
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: Welcome to the team, Glad to have you, Pleased you've joined us, Happy to have you here
   
   **Antonyms**: Farewell, Goodbye, We'll miss you (departure expressions)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when greeting new team members, passengers boarding vehicles, or anyone joining a group or organization. Appropriate for both literal boarding situations and metaphorical team joining.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in extremely formal ceremonial contexts where more elaborate welcomes are expected. Don't use when someone is leaving or when the joining is involuntary or unwelcome.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Welcome aboard! (exclamatory, enthusiastic)
   - Welcome aboard, [name]. (personalized)
   - We'd like to welcome [name] aboard. (third-person announcement)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression combines literal maritime language with business metaphor. It's slightly more informal than "Welcome" alone and creates a sense of journey or team unity. Uses positive politeness strategy by emphasizing inclusion.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Thanks! / Thank you! / Glad to be here!
   - Happy to be aboard. / Excited to join the team.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use informally when checking team member agreement or understanding before proceeding. More common in casual business and team contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal contexts prefer "on board" (two words) or "do you agree." Don't use when agreement is mandatory rather than voluntary. Note: "on board" is more standard than "aboard" for this meaning.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Are you on board with this? (more standard)
   - Is everyone aboard? (literal boarding check, or informal agreement check)
   - You aboard for this?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses metaphor of shared journey. More casual than "do you agree" and implies emotional/commitment level beyond intellectual agreement. Negative politeness strategy by framing as question rather than assuming agreement.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Yes, I'm aboard/on board. / Definitely.
   - I'm not sure yet. / I need more information. / Not quite.

   - *Directness*: direct but softened by metaphor
   
   **Synonyms**: I don't agree, I'm not on board, I can't support this, I have reservations, I'm opposed to this
   
   **Antonyms**: I'm aboard/on board, I agree, I support this, I'm in favor
   
   **When to Use**: Use when expressing disagreement in team contexts while maintaining collegiality. The metaphor softens the disagreement slightly compared to flat "I disagree."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal written documents prefer "I cannot support" or "I must express reservations." Don't use when you need to be extremely clear and direct about safety or ethical concerns.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I'm not on board with this. (more standard)
   - I can't get aboard with that idea.
   - I'm not quite aboard yet.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Softer than direct disagreement. Frames disagreement as not joining a journey rather than opposing an idea. Maintains negative politeness by not directly criticizing the idea but stating personal position.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - What are your concerns? / Can you explain why?
   - What would need to change for you to support it?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
