   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "aboard" for stationary buildings or ground-level contexts where "inside" or "in" would be more appropriate. Avoid using it with small personal vehicles like cars in everyday speech.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - come aboard
   - get aboard
   - welcome aboard
   - climb aboard
   - all aboard
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on, toward) + board (ship's deck) = onto the deck/vehicle
