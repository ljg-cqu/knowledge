1. **Linking Word**: before (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a temporal clause indicating that the action in the main clause occurs earlier than the action in the subordinate clause
   - *Function*: Establishes temporal sequence; main clause happens first, subordinate clause happens second
   
   **Synonyms**: prior to, ere (archaic), in advance of
   
   **Antonyms**: after, following, once, when
   
   **When to Use**: Expressing temporal sequence where main action precedes subordinate action; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simultaneity is meant (use "while"); when causation is primary (consider "because"); don't confuse temporal order
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [main clause] + before + [subordinate clause] OR Before + [subordinate clause], [main clause]
   - **Position**: Can begin sentence or link mid-sentence
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after subordinate clause when it begins sentence; no comma when subordinate clause follows main clause
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing which action happens first; using "before" when "after" is meant; incorrect tense sequencing
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by) + fore (front/earlier)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English beforan → Middle English → subordinating conjunction use (temporal)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Call me before you leave.
   - Before you go, can we talk?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Before implementing changes, comprehensive analysis must be conducted.

   **Antonyms**: after, following, subsequent to, later than
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing, academic papers, technical documentation, professional communication

   - **Position**: Typically follows main clause; can begin sentence in formal writing
   - **Punctuation**: Comma after initial phrase; generally no comma in mid-sentence position
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Using with full clauses (use "before" instead); overusing in informal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin prior (earlier) + to
