1. **Original Expression**: I'm speaking qua [role], not personally.  
   **Context**: Used in a panel discussion where a person holds both an official role and a private identity, and needs to clarify that the upcoming remarks are role‑based.
   
   **Core Intent**: To specify that the speaker's words should be understood as coming from a particular *role* or *capacity*, not as a purely personal opinion.
   
   **Casual**: I'm talking as your [role] here, not just as a friend.  
   *Characteristics*: Contractions ("I'm"), everyday verb "talking as", simple nouns (friend, boss), no Latin; warm, direct.  
   *Use when*: Small teams, friends, relaxed meetings where everyone knows each other and power distance is low.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I'm speaking in my role as [role], not in a personal capacity.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral vocabulary ("speaking", "in my role as", "personal capacity"), no Latin; clear but not stiff.  
   *Use when*: Standard workplace meetings, emails to colleagues, cross‑team discussions with moderate formality.
   
   **Formal**: I am speaking in my capacity qua [role], rather than in a private capacity.  
   *Characteristics*: Full forms ("I am"), legal‑style noun "capacity", Latin preposition "qua"; long balanced clause; highly explicit distinction.  
   *Use when*: Official statements, minutes, legal or governance contexts, high power distance situations (board meetings, formal hearings).
   
   **Humorous**: System message: "[Role‑mode ON, private‑mode OFF]"—so I'm speaking qua [role] right now.  
   *Characteristics*: Playful metaphor ("mode"), brackets, tech slang; makes stance explicit while lowering tension.  
   *Use when*: Team chats, light presentations, when rapport is good and the stakes are moderate.  
   *Avoid when*: Discussing serious risks, conflicts of interest, or legal responsibility—humor could be misread as lack of care.
   
   **Lively**: Right now I'm wearing my **[role] hat**—so what I say is qua [role], not just me off duty.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor ("wearing my hat"), emphasis, energetic rhythm; vivid image of switching hats/roles.  
   *Use when*: Workshops, talks, teaching sessions where you want engagement and clear framing without full legalese.
   
   **Empathetic**: As your [role], I want to be honest about this—and I'm speaking qua [role] because that role carries responsibilities to you.  
   *Characteristics*: First‑person concern ("I want to be honest"), reference to responsibility and care; connects role to support.  
   *Use when*: Difficult feedback, sensitive conversations, one‑to‑ones where you must balance care with duty.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher power distance → prefer **Semi‑Formal/Formal** variants; equal peers → **Casual/Lively** are safer.
   - *Social Distance*: New or external audiences → **Semi‑Formal/Formal**; close colleagues → **Casual/Humorous/Lively** can work.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Serious topics (discipline, legal risk, layoffs) → **Formal/Empathetic**; routine updates → **Semi‑Formal**; light topics → **Casual/Lively/Humorous**.
   - *Cultural Context*: Cultures favoring clear role boundaries and titles often expect **Formal** framing with explicit "capacity" language; flatter cultures may find heavy "qua" language pretentious.
   - *Medium*: Written records (email, minutes, reports) lean to **Semi‑Formal/Formal**; live speech (meetings, calls) allows **Lively/Empathetic** nuances.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using the formal "qua" variant in very casual settings, which can sound pretentious or distancing.
   - Failing to signal when you *switch* from personal to official capacity, causing confusion about whether you speak qua [role] or as a private individual.
   - Mixing registers inside one short message (e.g., heavy legalese plus slang), which can make stance unclear or undermine credibility.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many legal and governmental contexts, explicitly stating "in my capacity as/qua [role]" is expected for transparency and accountability. In some startup or egalitarian cultures, the same wording can feel overly stiff; "in my role as [role]" or "as your [role]" may strike a better balance.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal team retro with close colleagues → **Appropriate Variant**: *Casual* or *Lively* ("I'm talking as your tech lead here..." / "I'm wearing my tech‑lead hat...") to keep atmosphere open but still mark the role.
   - **Situation 2**: Email to a client about a compliance concern → **Appropriate Variant**: *Formal* ("I am speaking in my capacity qua project lead...") to underline that the warning is official and role‑based.
   - **Situation 3**: One‑to‑one about performance anxiety with a direct report → **Appropriate Variant**: *Empathetic* ("As your manager, I want to be honest about this...") to join care and responsibility while clarifying capacity.
