1. **Expression**: X qua Y (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A schematic expression where *X* (person/thing) is considered *as* or *in the capacity of* *Y* (role/aspect), e.g., "citizen qua voter", "state qua regulator"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the order "X qua Y" is stable; "qua" sits between the item and the role)
   
   **Synonyms**: X as Y, X in the capacity of Y, X viewed as Y, X considered as Y
   
   **Antonyms**: X regardless of Y, X apart from Y, X not as Y but as Z
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal, academic, and legal writing to make aspect distinctions precise—especially when the same person or entity plays multiple roles. Examples: "the individual qua citizen", "the firm qua employer".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in everyday conversation (sounds overly technical); don't use when no real contrast of roles/aspects is at stake; avoid piling multiple technical markers (e.g., *as qua*).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - individual qua [role]
   - state qua regulator / guarantor / employer
   - self qua subject / object
   - citizens qua voters / taxpayers
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: "Qua" is a Latin preposition meaning "as, in the capacity of"; English retains the Latin-like structure to mark careful role/aspect distinctions. This pattern is central to analytic philosophy, jurisprudence, and social theory when separating one and the same thing under different descriptions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin *qua* (in which respect, as) linking two noun phrases X and Y
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In normal talk we'd say "as a parent," but philosophers write "the person qua parent."
   - He's strict qua teacher but relaxed qua friend.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The citizen qua voter has different duties from the citizen qua consumer.
   - We model the firm qua nexus of contracts rather than qua mere physical asset bundle.

1. **Expression**: in my capacity qua [role] (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal way to introduce a statement made in an official or specific role, e.g., "in my capacity qua supervisor, I must deny this request"
   - *Fixedness*: strong ("in my capacity" + "qua" + role is a conventional legal/official formula)
   
   **Synonyms**: in my role as [role], acting as [role], in my official capacity as [role]
   
   **Antonyms**: in a personal capacity, not as [role], speaking purely privately
   
   **When to Use**: Use in legal, bureaucratic, and high‑stakes professional communication when clearly separating personal views from official decisions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual speech ("as your boss" is enough); don't use when role boundaries are irrelevant.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in his/her/their capacity qua [role]
   - acting in my capacity qua [role]
   - solely in my capacity qua [role]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: "Capacity" names the role; "qua" marks that what follows is the standpoint of that role; the whole phrase is standard in legalese and formal correspondence when one must be explicit about which hat one is wearing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition of state) + capacity (role) + qua (as, in the capacity of)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm not talking in my capacity qua manager—just as a friend.
   - In my capacity qua team lead, I have to say no.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In my capacity qua director, I am required to disclose this conflict of interest.
   - The ombudsperson, in her capacity qua independent officer, will review the complaint.

1. **Expression**: speaking qua [role] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A metadiscursive phrase used to signal from which role or standpoint the speaker is currently talking (e.g., "speaking qua researcher")
   - *Fixedness*: medium ("speaking" can vary as "talking"; "qua" + role is stable)
   
   **Synonyms**: speaking as [role], from the standpoint of [role], wearing my [role] hat
   
   **Antonyms**: speaking personally, speaking off the record, not speaking as [role]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in discussions where the same person has multiple identities (e.g., engineer, parent, citizen) and wants to clarify which perspective is active.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in purely informal chats; don't use when role distinction is trivial.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - speaking qua [professional role]
   - speaking qua member of [group]
   - I'm not speaking qua [role] here
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Speaking" marks the act; "qua" specifies the role frame; together they form a concise formula for explicit standpoint‑marking, popular in academic panels and expert commentary.
   
   **Root Analysis**: speak + -ing (present participle) + qua (as, in the capacity of)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Speaking qua friend, I'd say take the risk.
   - Speaking qua teacher, I'd say you need more practice.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Speaking qua researcher, I must emphasize the study's limitations.
   - Speaking qua regulator, I cannot endorse this proposal.

1. **Expression**: the state qua regulator (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A standard analytic phrase describing the state *in its role as* regulator, as opposed to other roles (employer, owner, provider)
   - *Fixedness*: medium‑strong (very common formula in legal and policy theory)
   
   **Synonyms**: the state as regulator, the state in its regulatory capacity, the state in its role as regulator
   
   **Antonyms**: the state qua employer, the state qua owner, the state qua welfare provider (contrasting roles)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in public‑law, regulatory, and policy analysis when you need to distinguish different functions of the state.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid outside legal/policy contexts; don't use when the discussion is about the state in general, with no specific functional focus.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - the state qua guarantor of rights
   - the state qua monopolist of legitimate force
   - the state qua provider of public goods
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "State" is a multi‑role entity; "qua regulator" selects the legal‑regulatory aspect; this formula has become conventional in analytic jurisprudence for carving up state functions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: state (political entity) + qua (as) + regulator (one who regulates)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're talking about the state qua regulator here, not qua employer.
   - Think of the government qua referee, not qua player.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The state qua regulator must remain neutral between competing market actors.
   - Liability arises only for the state qua regulator, not for ministers in their personal capacities.

1. **Expression**: citizens qua voters (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase picking out citizens specifically in their electoral role, not in all their social roles
   - *Fixedness*: medium (the pattern "X qua voters" appears frequently in political theory)
   
   **Synonyms**: citizens as voters, citizens in their role as voters, citizens considered as voters
   
   **Antonyms**: citizens qua taxpayers, citizens qua workers, citizens qua consumers
   
   **When to Use**: Use in democratic theory and political science when analyzing duties, rights, or behavior tied to voting.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when talking about citizens' general lives; don't use when the role is not specifically electoral.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - citizens qua addressees of law
   - citizens qua co‑legislators
   - citizens qua subjects of coercion
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Democratic citizens occupy many roles; combining "citizens" with "qua voters" allows precise focus on electoral responsibilities and entitlements, a standard move in normative political theory.
   
   **Root Analysis**: citizen (member of a polity) + qua (as) + voter (one who votes)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm talking about us qua voters now, not qua fans of a party.
   - Citizens qua voters have power that they lack qua employees.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Citizens qua voters exercise episodic but decisive control over political office‑holders.
   - The norm applies to individuals only qua citizens, and more specifically qua voters in competitive elections.
