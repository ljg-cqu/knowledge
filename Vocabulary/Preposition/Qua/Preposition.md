1. **Preposition**: qua (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract role)* As; in the capacity of; considered in a particular role, aspect, or function rather than in every respect
   - *(Philosophical/Legal)* Used to specify the respect or standpoint under which someone or something is being regarded (for example, "the state qua regulator" or "the agent qua moral subject")
   
   **Synonyms**: as (in one's role as), in the capacity of, in the character of, considered as, in one's role as (formal)
   
   **Antonyms**: regardless of (viewed independently of role), apart from (this aspect), aside from, beyond (this capacity)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "qua" in very formal, academic, legal, or philosophical writing when you want to be precise about *which aspect* or *which role* of a person or thing you are talking about. It helps distinguish, for example, a person qua citizen (as a citizen) from the same person qua employee (as an employee). Typical in analytic philosophy, jurisprudence, political theory, and theoretical social sciences.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in everyday conversation and general-purpose writing; native speakers almost always use simple "as" or "in my role as" instead. Do not use "qua" where no contrast of roles/aspects is relevant, or as a fancy substitute for ordinary prepositions. Avoid redundant combinations such as "as qua" or "in the capacity qua".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: X qua Y (the artist qua activist, individuals qua citizens, language qua social practice)
   - **Noun + qua + noun**: the company qua legal person, the self qua subject, the body qua object
   - **Contrastive frames**: not X qua Y, but qua Z (the state not qua employer, but qua regulator)
   - **Abstract formulations**: F qua F (freedom qua freedom, justice qua justice) in philosophical writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: qua (Latin ablative feminine singular of *qui* "which / who") used adverbially meaning "in which capacity / in which respect"; treated in English as an indeclinable preposition
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *qua* ("in which respect, as"), originally an inflected form of the relative pronoun *qui* (who/which). Borrowed into scholarly English around the 17th century, preserved mainly in legal and philosophical registers to mark the exact aspect or status under consideration.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In normal speech people say "as a teacher" rather than "qua teacher"; "qua" sounds very academic or jokingly formal.
   - You might hear someone playfully say, "I'm speaking here qua nerd, not qua manager," to emphasize which side of themselves is talking.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The manager qua employer has legal obligations that differ from her obligations qua private individual.
   - This article considers the citizen qua voter, rather than qua taxpayer or market participant.
