   **Meaning**:

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - formal capacity
   - formal role
   - formal relationship
   - formal authority
   - formal status qua member
   
   **Root Analysis**: form (shape, outward appearance) + -al (relating to)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - institutional role
   - institutional identity
   - institutional capacity
   - institutional perspective
   - institutional responsibilities qua employer
   
   **Root Analysis**: institut(e) (establish, set up) + -ion (act, result) + -al (relating to)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - functional role
   - functional identity
   - functional standpoint
   - functional analysis of X qua Y
   - primarily functional rather than symbolic
   
   **Root Analysis**: funct (perform, execute) + -ion (act) + -al (relating to)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - nominal role
   - nominal head of state
   - nominal authority
   - merely nominal capacity
   - nominal status qua chair
   
   **Root Analysis**: nomin- (name) + -al (relating to)
