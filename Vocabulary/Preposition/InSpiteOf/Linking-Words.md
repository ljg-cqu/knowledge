1. **Linking Word**: in spite of (type: complex preposition/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a fact that makes another fact surprising; shows that something happens although there is a reason it might not.
   - *Function*: concessive connector, usually followed by a noun, noun phrase, or -ing form.
   
   **Synonyms**: despite, notwithstanding, regardless of, even with (in some contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: because of, due to, on account of, thanks to
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to present a contrast between an obstacle and a result that still happens; works in both spoken and written English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Directly before a full clause without a noun phrase (use "although" / "even though" or "in spite of the fact that..."); in very compressed technical writing where "despite" is preferred for brevity.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: In spite of [noun / noun phrase / -ing], [main clause].
   - [Position]: Most common at the beginning of the sentence; can also appear mid‑sentence.
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after the in‑spite‑of phrase when it comes first; no comma when it is in the middle of the sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: *"in spite of of" (double *of*), mixing spelled forms (*inspite of* is incorrect – always three words).
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + spite (ill‑will, malice) + of → originally "in defiance of" something.
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English phrase "in despite of" → shortened to "in spite of", keeping the idea of continuing in defiance of circumstances.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of the rain, we went for a walk.
   - She stayed positive in spite of the bad news.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In spite of considerable budget constraints, the programme met its key performance indicators.
   - The organisation maintained operational stability in spite of significant external shocks.

1. **Linking Word**: despite (type: simple preposition/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Functions almost identically to "in spite of" but is shorter and slightly more compact.
   - *Function*: concessive; introduces a contrast between expectation and reality.
   
   **Synonyms**: in spite of, notwithstanding, regardless of
   
   **Antonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, thanks to
   
   **When to Use**: Whenever "in spite of" would be natural, but you prefer a shorter form, especially in writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very beginner‑level teaching materials focused on multi‑word phrases, or when you want to emphasise defiance using the longer "in spite of".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Despite [noun / noun phrase / -ing], [main clause].
   - [Position]: Usually sentence‑initial or mid‑sentence.
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after the despite‑phrase when it opens the sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: *"despite of" (incorrect – never add *of* after "despite").
   
   **Root Analysis**: de- (down) + spite (contempt, ill will).
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *despit* → English *despite*; originally "in contempt of", now a neutral concessive connector often paired conceptually with "in spite of".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Despite the traffic, we made it on time.
   - He passed the exam despite not studying much.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Despite methodological limitations, the findings make a meaningful contribution to the literature.
   - Performance remained strong despite volatile market conditions.

1. **Linking Word**: in spite of the fact that (type: complex conjunction phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A more explicit way to introduce a full clause after "in spite of" by turning it into a noun phrase.
   - *Function*: concessive clause connector, roughly equivalent to "although" or "even though".
   
   **Synonyms**: although, even though, despite the fact that, notwithstanding that
   
   **Antonyms**: because, since, as, given that
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to keep the "in spite of" flavour but need to follow it with a full clause rather than a noun phrase.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very concise writing ("although" is shorter); in informal speech where it sounds wordy or heavy.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: In spite of the fact that [clause], [main clause].
   - [Position]: Almost always sentence‑initial.
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after the clause introduced by "in spite of the fact that".
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Doubling up on connectives (e.g., *"In spite of the fact that it was late, but we stayed"* – remove "but").
   
   **Root Analysis**: in spite of (preposition) + the fact (noun phrase) + that (clause marker) → grammatical trick to let "in spite of" govern a clause.
   
   **Etymology**: Built from existing elements in English; widely used in learner writing as a safe but wordy alternative to "although".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of the fact that it was late, we kept talking.
   - In spite of the fact that he was tired, he finished the game.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In spite of the fact that the sample was small, the pattern was consistent across all subgroups.
   - In spite of the fact that the deadline was strict, the team delivered a comprehensive solution.

1. **Linking Word**: even though (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a full clause that contrasts with the main clause; emphasises how surprising the main clause is in spite of the subordinate clause.
   - *Function*: strong concessive connector for clauses.
   
   **Synonyms**: although, though, in spite of the fact that, despite the fact that
   
   **Antonyms**: because, since, so that, therefore (causal/consequence connectors)
   
   **When to Use**: When you need a clause‑to‑clause contrast instead of a prepositional phrase, and you want stronger emphasis than simple "although".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal academic writing where "although" or "whereas" may feel more neutral; when the contrast is weak.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Even though [subordinate clause], [main clause].
   - [Position]: Clause with "even though" usually comes first; can also follow the main clause.
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after the subordinate clause when it comes first; no comma when it follows.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: *"Even though... but" (double contrast), using it where a simple "because" is needed.
   
   **Root Analysis**: even (emphasis) + though (concessive conjunction) → "even if it’s true that...".
   
   **Etymology**: Built inside English by strengthening the older conjunction "though", often taught together with "in spite of" to contrast preposition vs conjunction.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Even though it was raining, we had a good time.
   - She went to the gym even though she was exhausted.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Even though the pilot was small, it provided important signals about feasibility.
   - The proposal merits consideration even though several open issues remain.

1. **Linking Word**: even with (type: complex preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces an advantage or helpful factor that surprisingly does *not* prevent a problem; shows that something is true in spite of that advantage.
   - *Function*: concessive; often used with a positive noun phrase: "Even with all this help, X still happened."
   
   **Synonyms**: in spite of having, despite having, with all, for all
   
   **Antonyms**: because of, thanks to, due to (when the advantage *does* change the result)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to stress that extra support, tools, or resources were present, but in spite of them, the expected good result did not follow.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Before clearly negative factors ("even with the problems" is weaker than "even though there were problems"); in very formal writing prefer "in spite of" or "despite".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Even with [advantage], [unexpected negative or modest result].
   - [Position]: Phrase commonly comes at the beginning, but mid‑sentence is also possible.
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after the "even with" phrase when it leads the sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using it as if it meant "because of"; it normally signals surprise that the advantage was not enough.
   
   **Root Analysis**: even (emphasiser) + with (accompaniment preposition).
   
   **Etymology**: Built in English as a modifier of plain "with"; commonly taught with "in spite of" because both emphasise contrast.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Even with all that help, in spite of everything, we didn’t finish on time.
   - She struggled even with the easy questions.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Even with substantial funding, the initiative failed to reach its intended scale.
   - Even with extensive training, in spite of careful preparation, error rates remained high.
