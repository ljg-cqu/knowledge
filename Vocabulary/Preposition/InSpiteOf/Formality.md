   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher‑ups or formal audiences → **Formal**; peers and direct reports → **Semi‑Formal** or **Empathetic**.
   - *Social Distance*: New or external contacts → avoid very Casual/Humorous; long‑term team → Lively/Humorous acceptable.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If people are tired or hurt, emphasise **Empathetic**; if it’s a simple win, **Lively** is fine.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures value modest, low‑emotion **Formal** versions; others enjoy explicit celebration.

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "pulled it off" or other slang in official documents reduces perceived professionalism.
   - Jumping straight to Lively celebration when people are still exhausted can feel insensitive.
   - Overusing "in spite of" in one paragraph makes the style sound repetitive; vary with "although" / "even though".
   
   **Cultural Notes**: English‑speaking workplaces often expect open celebration, but many East Asian or Northern European teams prefer modest, low‑drama wording even in spite of big wins.
