1. **Expression**: in spite of everything (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A summary phrase meaning "despite all the problems, events, or difficulties that have happened".
   - Emphasises that your decision, feeling, or result survives a long list of negatives.
   - *Fixedness*: strong – the phrase is very stable, often used at the beginning or end of a sentence.
   
   **Synonyms**: despite everything, in spite of it all, despite all that, after all that
   
   **Antonyms**: because of everything, as a result of all this, given everything that happened
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to wrap up a story of difficulty and highlight what still remains true – hope, support, or success – in spite of all the trouble.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal academic writing (sounds conversational); when it is better to list specific obstacles instead of saying "everything".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in spite of it all
   - in spite of all that
   - despite everything
   
   **Fixedness Level**: medium‑strong – wording is quite fixed but the pronoun (everything/it all/all that) can vary.
   
   **Why This Partnership**: "In spite of" encodes concession, and "everything" bundles all previous problems into a single, powerful noun; together they highlight survival after many blows.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + spite + of + everything (all things that happened).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of everything, we’re still friends.
   - She stayed hopeful in spite of everything that went wrong.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In spite of everything that occurred during the transition, the organisation preserved its core mission and values.
   - Stakeholder confidence remained relatively stable in spite of everything described in the preceding sections.

1. **Expression**: in spite of yourself (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - You do or feel something even though you did not plan to, or even wanted not to; your reaction happens almost against your own decision.
   - *Fixedness*: strong – structure is fixed; only the possessive pronoun (yourself/himself/herself/themselves) changes.
   
   **Synonyms**: despite yourself, almost against your will, even though you didn’t mean to
   
   **Antonyms**: fully intentionally, on purpose, by deliberate choice
   
   **When to Use**: When someone is pleased, amused, impressed, or moved in spite of trying not to be; often mildly humorous.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal writing; when strong consent or agency needs to be emphasised instead of a slip in control.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in spite of myself, I smiled
   - she liked it in spite of herself
   - he laughed in spite of himself
   
   **Fixedness Level**: strong – pattern "in spite of + reflexive pronoun" rarely changes.
   
   **Why This Partnership**: The usual external contrast of "in spite of" is turned inward: the obstacle is *your own intention*, and your reaction happens anyway.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + spite + of + reflexive pronoun (myself/yourself/etc.).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of myself, I laughed at the joke.
   - She enjoyed the movie in spite of herself.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In spite of himself, the reviewer acknowledged that the approach was innovative and carefully executed.
   - The audience, in spite of themselves, responded warmly to the unconventional proposal.

1. **Expression**: in spite of all odds (type: collocation/idiomatic extension)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A variant of "against all odds" that stresses success or survival when the probability of success is very low.
   - *Fixedness*: medium – less common than "against all odds", but understandable and used for emphasis.
   
   **Synonyms**: against all odds, despite the odds, in spite of the odds, defying expectations
   
   **Antonyms**: as expected, predictably, with every advantage, under ideal conditions
   
   **When to Use**: In storytelling or motivational contexts when you want to emphasise how surprising success was in spite of the numbers or circumstances.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In precise statistical writing; in neutral descriptions where drama would be out of place.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in spite of the odds
   - in spite of all the odds stacked against us
   - against all odds (preferred idiom)
   
   **Fixedness Level**: medium – can be adjusted slightly, but the "in spite of" + "odds" core stays.
   
   **Why This Partnership**: "Odds" brings a probability metaphor; combining it with "in spite of" creates a vivid picture of success that ignores what statistics predicted.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in spite of + all + odds (chances, probabilities).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of all the odds, they won the championship.
   - She recovered in spite of all the odds against her.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The venture reached profitability in spite of the odds implied by historical failure rates in this sector.
   - The programme remained operational in spite of the odds created by repeated funding cuts and staff turnover.

1. **Expression**: in spite of all this / that (type: discourse phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase used to refer back to a list of points just mentioned and then introduce a contrasting conclusion.
   - *Fixedness*: medium‑strong – "in spite of all this" and "in spite of all that" are both common.
   
   **Synonyms**: despite all this, despite all that, even with all this, after all this
   
   **Antonyms**: because of all this, given all this, as a result of all that
   
   **When to Use**: At the end of a paragraph or story where you have listed problems, then you want to say what still holds true.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: At the very beginning of a discussion (nothing to refer back to yet); in highly technical writing where you should restate the key factor instead of saying "all this".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in spite of all this, [positive conclusion]
   - in spite of all that, [continued belief]
   - even with all this, [result]
   
   **Fixedness Level**: medium – pronoun can change (this/that), but the frame remains stable.
   
   **Why This Partnership**: "All this/that" points back to a chunk of discourse; "in spite of" signals that, although those details matter, they do not cancel the main point.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in spite of + all + this/that (previously mentioned issues).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In spite of all this, I still think it was worth trying.
   - In spite of all that, we’re still here and still moving.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In spite of all this, the central hypothesis remains plausible and testable.
