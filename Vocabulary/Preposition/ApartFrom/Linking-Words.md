1. **Linking Word**: apart from (type: prepositional connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates exception or exclusion from a general statement (similar to "except")
   - Indicates addition to what has been mentioned (similar to "besides")
   - *Function*: Signals exclusion or addition; creates exception or supplementary relationship
   
   **Synonyms**: except for (exclusion), besides (addition), aside from (both), other than (exclusion), in addition to (addition)
   
   **Antonyms**: including, together with, along with, as well as, in conjunction with
   
   **When to Use**: Introducing exceptions to general statements; adding supplementary information; creating contrast between general and specific
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When logical relationship is causation rather than exception/addition; when inclusion is meant; in highly formal academic writing (prefer more specific connectors)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [General statement], apart from [exception]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence or sentence-initial (less common)
   - [Punctuation]: Usually requires comma before "apart from" when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing exclusion and addition senses; forgetting comma; using with finite verbs (use "apart from the fact that" instead)
   
   **Root Analysis**: apart (away, separately) + from (indicating source or separation)
   
   **Etymology**: "Apart" from Old French "à part" (to the side) + "from" from Old English "fram"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone came to the party, apart from John.
   - Apart from being tired, I'm really enjoying this trip.

   **Synonyms**: apart from, other than, but, save, excluding
   
   **Antonyms**: including, plus, with, together with
   
   **When to Use**: Introducing exceptions to universal or general statements; excluding specific items from categories
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When addition rather than exclusion is meant; after negative statements in some contexts (can create double negative)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Universal statement] except [exception]; [Everyone/Everything/All] except [X]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence after general statement
   - [Punctuation]: Usually no comma before "except" in simple sentences; comma may be used in complex constructions
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "Except of" (incorrect—should be "except for"); using with additional prepositions
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + cept (take, capture)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "exceptus" (past participle of excipere: to take out) → Old French → English

   - [Clause structure]: Besides [X], [additional statement]; [Statement], and besides, [additional point]
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (common as discourse marker) or mid-sentence (as preposition)
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "besides" when sentence-initial; comma before when used as discourse marker
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using at sentence end; confusing with "beside" (next to)
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by) + side + -s (adverbial/prepositional suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "bi sidan" (by the side) → "besides"

   - [Common errors to avoid]: Ambiguous scope (clarify what "excluding" applies to)
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out) + clud (close) + -ing
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "excludere" (to shut out) → English "exclude" + -ing
