1. **Preposition**: than (type: comparative marker/conjunction-preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Comparative)* Used to introduce the second element in a comparison, indicating the standard against which the first element is measured
   - *(Abstract)* Marks the basis of comparison in structures expressing difference in degree, quantity, or quality
   
   **Synonyms**: compared to (in context), as opposed to (in context), versus (informal comparative)
   
   **Antonyms**: as (in equality constructions: as...as)
   
   **When to Use**: All comparative constructions with comparative adjectives and adverbs; expressing preferences; indicating relative degree or quantity; universal across all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: After positive adjectives without comparative form (use "as...as"); commonly confused with "then" (temporal); avoid "different than" in formal writing (prefer "different from")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: [comparative] than [noun/pronoun]
   - **Verb + prep**: be [comparative] than, seem [comparative] than, appear [comparative] than
   - **Adjective + prep**: [comparative adjective] than [standard]
   - **Noun + prep**: N/A (than follows comparatives, not nouns directly)
   
   **Root Analysis**: than (from Old English "þanne," related to "then")
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "þanne" (then, at that time) → Middle English specialized as comparative marker → Modern English "than" (12th century grammaticalization)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: than (in most contexts), compared with, versus
   
   **Antonyms**: from (directional opposite, not comparative opposite)
   
   **When to Use**: With specific adjectives (superior/inferior/senior/junior to); with "prefer...to" construction; formal register; established collocations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With standard comparative adjectives ending in -er (use "than"); inconsistently with "prefer" (use either "prefer X to Y" or "prefer X rather than Y," not mixed)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: superior to, inferior to, senior to, junior to
   - **Verb + prep**: prefer X to Y, compare X to Y
