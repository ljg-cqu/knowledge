   **When to Use**: Expressing personal preferences clearly; declining options politely; making choices between alternatives; everyday decision-making contexts

   **Common Variations**: 
   - I would rather [X] than [Y] (more formal)
   - I'd much rather [X] than [Y] (stronger preference)
   - I'd sooner [X] than [Y] (more emphatic, sometimes hyperbolic)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This construction uses indirect preference statement to soften what could be a direct refusal. Common in negative politeness strategies where speaker protects their own face while declining.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That's fine, we can do [X] then
   - Fair enough, [X] it is
   - Sure, no problem

   - It's usually better to [X] than (to) [Y] (general recommendation)
   - It would be better to [X] than (to) [Y] (conditional, softer)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Impersonal construction "it's better" reduces imposition and face-threat compared to "you should." Common in both positive politeness (offering helpful advice) and negative politeness (not imposing directly).

   **When to Use**: Asking about preferences politely; decision-making discussions; offering choices to others; social conversations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal surveys or research (use "Do you prefer"); when someone has already stated their preference clearly

   - More [adjective] than it needs to be (casual explanation)
   - More [adjective] than you need to be (can sound critical of person, use carefully)
