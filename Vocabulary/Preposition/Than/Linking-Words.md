1. **Linking Word**: than (type: subordinating conjunction/comparative marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces the second element in a comparison, indicating the standard against which something is measured or evaluated
   - *Function*: Creates comparative relationship between two elements; marks the basis of comparison in comparative constructions
   
   **Synonyms**: compared to, in comparison with, relative to, as opposed to, versus
   
   **Antonyms**: as (in equality comparisons: as...as)
   
   **When to Use**: Making comparisons with comparative adjectives/adverbs; expressing preferences; indicating degree or extent relative to standard; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: After positive adjectives without comparative form (use "as...as" instead); when "then" (temporal) is intended (common spelling error)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [be/verb] + [comparative adjective/adverb] + than + [noun/pronoun/clause]
   - [Position]: follows comparative form; mid-sentence position
   - [Punctuation]: no comma before "than" in standard comparisons
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "different than" (use "different from" in formal writing), "than" vs. "then" confusion, subject-verb agreement issues in clauses after "than"
   
   **Root Analysis**: than (from Old English "thanne," originally meaning "then")
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "þanne" (then, when) → Middle English "than" → specialized as comparative marker (12th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This coffee is way better than the one we had yesterday.

   **Synonyms**: instead of, in place of, as opposed to, as an alternative to
   
   **Antonyms**: in addition to, along with, together with (additive rather than contrastive)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and academic writing; explaining decisions and choices; contrasting approaches or methods; emphasizing deliberate selection
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual conversation (use "instead of"); when simple coordination clearer than contrast; when causing sentence fragments
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + [object/complement] + rather than + [parallel structure]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence after main clause; can begin sentence in formal writing
   - [Punctuation]: comma after "rather than" clause when it begins sentence; no comma when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: non-parallel structures after "rather than," sentence fragments, informal contexts where "instead of" is more appropriate
   
   **Root Analysis**: rather (preferably, more willingly) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "rather" (more readily) + "than" → compound connector (16th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Rather than wait, I just walked home.

   **Synonyms**: except for, aside from, apart from, with the exception of, excluding
   
   **Antonyms**: including, along with, in addition to, as well as
   
   **When to Use**: Making exceptions to statements; qualifying broad claims; excluding specific instances from general rules; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When exception so significant it undermines general statement; when "except" would be clearer and more concise
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [general statement] + other than + [exception]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence after noun it modifies; can begin dependent clause
   - [Punctuation]: commas around "other than" phrase when it's non-restrictive information
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusion with "rather than" (choice vs. exception), unclear scope of exception
   
   **Root Analysis**: other (different, additional) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: "Other" + "than" → compound meaning "different from" → specialized as exception marker (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Other than Monday, I'm free all week.
   - I don't know anyone here other than you.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: no less than, at least, minimum (for lower boundaries)
   
   **When to Use**: Setting precise limits or boundaries; formal specifications; emphasizing exact standards; superlative expressions through negative comparison
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When positive statement would be clearer; when double negatives create confusion; very casual contexts
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + no/nothing/none + [comparative] + than + [limit/standard]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence as complement; "nothing" and "none" can be subjects
   - [Punctuation]: standard sentence punctuation; no special comma rules
   - [Common errors to avoid]: double negative confusion, unclear scope of negation, ambiguity about whether boundary is inclusive or exclusive
   
   **Root Analysis**: no/nothing/none (negatives) + than (comparative marker) → negative comparative structure
   
   **Etymology**: Old English negative particles + "than" → emphatic negative comparative construction
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Nothing's better than pizza on Friday night.
   - I have no more than ten dollars left.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Quantifying amounts; expressing that thresholds are exceeded; intensifying degree; all registers but particularly in factual, numerical contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With uncountable quantities when precision matters (specify exact measurement); when "over" would be simpler and clearer
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + more than + [number/amount] + [noun]
   - [Position]: pre-nominal as quantifier; can function as degree intensifier with adjectives
   - [Punctuation]: no comma when functioning as quantifier; standard punctuation otherwise
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "more than" with comparative adjectives (redundant: "more better than" incorrect), confusion with "rather than"
   
   **Root Analysis**: more (greater amount) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "māra" + "than" → quantifying comparative phrase (Middle English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There were more than fifty people at the party.

   **Antonyms**: more than, over, above, exceeding, beyond
   
   **When to Use**: Quantifying amounts below threshold; expressing insufficiency; minimizing degree; factual statements about quantities
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With countable nouns in formal writing (use "fewer than"); when "under" or "below" would be clearer; when minimizing might seem dismissive
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + less than + [number/amount] + [noun]
   - [Position]: pre-nominal as quantifier; can function as degree minimizer with adjectives
   - [Punctuation]: no comma when functioning as quantifier
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "less than" with countable nouns in formal writing (use "fewer than"), unclear whether boundary is inclusive, negative tone when neutral intended
   
   **Root Analysis**: less (smaller amount) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "læssa" + "than" → quantifying comparative phrase (Middle English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It took less than an hour to finish.
   - There were less than ten people there. (note: "fewer" is prescriptively correct with countables)

   **Synonyms**: earlier than, before, prior to, ahead of
   
   **Antonyms**: later than, after, following, subsequent to
   
   **When to Use**: Discussing timing and temporal sequences; expressing that events happened faster or earlier than anticipated; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simple "before" would be clearer; when temporal comparison adds no meaningful information
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [event/action] + [occurred] + sooner than + [expected/another event]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence or end position in temporal statements
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "sooner than" when it introduces contrasting information
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusion with "sooner or later" (idiom meaning "eventually"), redundancy with other temporal markers
   
   **Root Analysis**: sooner (comparative of "soon," early in time) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "sōna" (soon) + comparative suffix → "sooner" + "than" (Middle English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She got here sooner than I expected.
   - The movie ended sooner than we thought.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: worse than, inferior to, less effective than, not as good as
   
   **When to Use**: Making quality assessments; expressing preferences; evaluating performance; comparing effectiveness; all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When objective measurement rather than evaluative comparison is needed; when avoiding value judgments is important
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [be/perform/work] + better than + [comparison standard]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence following verb; can be fronted for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: no comma in standard comparative statements
   - [Common errors to avoid]: redundancy ("more better than" is incorrect), unclear comparison standard, subjective judgment presented as objective fact
   
   **Root Analysis**: better (comparative of "good," superior) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "betera" + "than" → qualitative comparative phrase (Old English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [be/perform] + worse than + [comparison standard]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence following verb; end position common
   - [Punctuation]: no comma in standard comparative statements
   - [Common errors to avoid]: redundancy ("more worse" is incorrect), using in contexts where softened language appropriate, unclear whether making absolute or relative judgment
   
   **Root Analysis**: worse (comparative of "bad," inferior) + than (comparative marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "wiersa" + "than" → negative qualitative comparative phrase (Old English)

   **When to Use**: Formal writing and literature; emphasizing immediate temporal succession; dramatic narrative; highlighting cause-and-effect immediacy
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (sounds literary); when simple "as soon as" would be clearer; contemporary informal writing
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: No sooner + [auxiliary + subject + verb (past perfect)] + than + [subject + verb (simple past)]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial with inverted subject-auxiliary structure
   - [Punctuation]: no comma between "no sooner" clause and "than" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: incorrect tense sequence (must use past perfect + simple past), failure to invert subject and auxiliary after "no sooner," using in informal contexts where it sounds unnatural
   
   **Root Analysis**: no (negative) + sooner (comparative temporal) + than (comparative marker) → correlative emphasizing immediacy
   
   **Etymology**: Emphatic negative comparative construction → specialized temporal correlative (17th century literary English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used casually; sounds literary: "No sooner had I left than it started raining" → more natural: "Right after I left, it started raining")

   - [Position]: mid-sentence with parallel structures required
   - [Punctuation]: no comma between correlated elements
   - [Common errors to avoid]: non-parallel structures, using with single-syllable adjectives that take -er suffix, unclear comparison
   
   **Root Analysis**: more (greater degree) + [quality] + than (comparative marker) + [contrasting quality]
   
   **Etymology**: Comparative structure using "more" as degree marker with "than" introducing comparison standard (Middle English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's more smart than hardworking. (Note: "smarter" is more natural)
