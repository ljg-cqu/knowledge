1. **Linking Word**: notwithstanding (type: subordinating conjunction / discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Although; even though; despite the fact that; used to introduce a subordinate clause that contrasts with the main clause
   - *Function*: Creates concessive relationship between clauses, indicating that the main clause is true despite the condition in the subordinate clause
   
   **Synonyms**: although, though, even though, while, despite the fact that, in spite of the fact that
   
   **Antonyms**: because, since, as, given that, due to the fact that
   
   **When to Use**: Formal academic writing, legal documents, professional correspondence; introducing subordinate clauses that express concession; when emphasizing contrast between expected and actual outcomes; maintaining formal register in complex sentences
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (use "even though" or "although" instead); informal writing; when simpler conjunctions suffice; avoid in speech (sounds overly formal); don't use when "but" would be clearer; avoid overuse as it can sound pretentious
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Main clause] + notwithstanding + [subordinate clause]
   - [Clause structure]: Notwithstanding + [subordinate clause] + [main clause]
   - [Position]: typically introduces subordinate clause, can appear sentence-initially or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma required when notwithstanding-clause precedes main clause; no comma when it follows main clause (unless for clarity)
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use with "that" (write "notwithstanding the fact that" if necessary); avoid double negatives; don't confuse with prepositional usage (which takes noun phrase, not clause)
   
   **Root Analysis**: not + withstanding = conjunctive use meaning "despite the circumstance that"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → extended from prepositional to conjunctive use in formal legal and academic discourse → maintains elevated register
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're going hiking tomorrow, notwithstanding it might rain.
   - Notwithstanding he's really busy, he still makes time for his family.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The project will proceed as scheduled, notwithstanding several team members have expressed reservations about the timeline.
   - Notwithstanding the committee has raised significant concerns, the proposal warrants serious consideration given its potential benefits.
