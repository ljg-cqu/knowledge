1. **Expression**: notwithstanding the foregoing (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Despite what has been stated previously; in spite of the preceding information or provisions; legal/formal phrase indicating an exception to prior statements
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed in legal contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: despite the above, in spite of what was stated, regardless of the preceding, the above notwithstanding
   
   **Antonyms**: in accordance with the foregoing, pursuant to the above, as stated above
   
   **When to Use**: Legal contracts, formal agreements, policy documents, corporate bylaws; when establishing exceptions to previously stated rules or provisions; formal written communication requiring precision
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation or informal writing; when simpler phrases like "but still" or "even so" suffice; avoid in general audience communication (too technical/legal); don't use in creative or narrative writing
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - notwithstanding anything to the contrary
   - notwithstanding the above
   - the foregoing notwithstanding
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: Standard legal boilerplate language ensuring clarity in contracts; "foregoing" (meaning "previously mentioned") naturally combines with "notwithstanding" to signal exceptions; conventional usage in legal English for centuries; provides precise reference to specific prior clauses
   
   **Root Analysis**: notwithstanding (not opposing) + the foregoing (that which came before) = "despite what was stated earlier"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not typically used casually; overly formal for everyday speech]
   - Notwithstanding what I just said, I still think we should try it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company reserves the right to modify these terms with thirty days' notice.

2. **Expression**: anything to the contrary notwithstanding (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Despite any statement or provision that contradicts this; regardless of conflicting information; legal phrase establishing supremacy of a particular clause
   - *Fixedness*: strong (legal formulaic expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: regardless of contrary provisions, despite any conflicting terms, notwithstanding contrary statements
   
   **Antonyms**: in conformity with other provisions, subject to other terms, consistent with prior clauses
   
   **When to Use**: Legal documents, contracts, constitutions, legislative texts; when establishing a clause that overrides potentially conflicting provisions; ensuring clarity about hierarchy of provisions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: General writing; informal contexts; when addressing lay audiences; avoid redundant use with other similar phrases; don't use in everyday communication
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - any provision to the contrary notwithstanding
   - anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding
   - any other provision notwithstanding
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: Legal convention ensuring supremacy clause clarity; "to the contrary" naturally pairs with "notwithstanding" to emphasize precedence; derived from Latin legal terminology; standard phrasing in Anglo-American contract law
   
   **Root Analysis**: anything (universal reference) + to the contrary (in opposition) + notwithstanding (despite) = "despite any opposing statement"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not applicable to casual usage - purely legal/formal]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, this indemnification clause shall remain enforceable even after contract termination.
   - The arbitration provision shall apply to all disputes, anything to the contrary notwithstanding in any other section of this Agreement.

3. **Expression**: notwithstanding any provision (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Despite any clause, rule, or stipulation; regardless of other stated requirements; signals an exception to general provisions
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common in legal/formal contexts but can vary)
   
   **Synonyms**: regardless of any clause, despite any stipulation, irrespective of any provision, without regard to other terms
   
   **Antonyms**: in accordance with all provisions, subject to all terms, pursuant to established clauses
   
   **When to Use**: Legal and policy documents; establishing priority of specific provisions; formal business writing; regulatory texts; when carving out exceptions to general rules
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Informal communication; when addressing non-specialist audiences; creative writing; conversational contexts; avoid when simpler phrasing achieves the same goal
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - notwithstanding any other provision
   - notwithstanding any provision herein
   - notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Notwithstanding" naturally precedes "provision" in legal discourse to signal exceptions; semantic compatibility between concessive meaning and legal clauses; conventional professional usage; high frequency of co-occurrence in contracts
   
   **Root Analysis**: notwithstanding (despite) + any (universal) + provision (stipulated clause) = "despite any stated clause"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not appropriate for casual use]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Notwithstanding any provision in this handbook, management reserves the right to modify policies as necessary.
   - Employees may be terminated without notice, notwithstanding any provision suggesting a mandatory review process.

4. **Expression**: X notwithstanding (type: postpositive construction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Despite X; with X placed before "notwithstanding" for emphasis; inverted concessive construction placing the obstacle first
   - *Fixedness*: medium (flexible with various noun phrases)
   
   **Synonyms**: despite X, in spite of X, regardless of X, X aside
   
   **Antonyms**: because of X, due to X, thanks to X
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing when emphasizing the obstacle or contrary condition; literary style; academic discourse; legal writing; when fronting the concessive element for rhetorical effect
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual speech (use "even with" or "despite" instead); when standard word order is clearer; avoid in technical writing where clarity trumps style; don't overuse as it can sound affected
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - objections notwithstanding
   - difficulties notwithstanding
   - circumstances notwithstanding
   - the evidence notwithstanding
   - all that notwithstanding
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Postpositive placement emphasizes the obstacle being overcome; rhetorical device inherited from legal Latin; creates dramatic effect by fronting the contrary condition; allows flexible noun phrase insertion
   
   **Root Analysis**: [Noun phrase] + notwithstanding = postpositive construction emphasizing concession
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The weather notwithstanding, we still had an amazing vacation.
   - His lack of experience notwithstanding, he did a really great job.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
