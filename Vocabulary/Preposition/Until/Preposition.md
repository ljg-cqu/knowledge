# Preposition: Until

1. **Preposition**: until (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Up to the point in time or the event mentioned; continuing up to a specified time and then stopping
   - *(Spatial)* (Less common) Up to a particular place or point
   
   **Synonyms**: till, up to, up until, before (in some contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: from, since, after
   
   **When to Use**: Use "until" to indicate the continuation of an action or state up to a specific point in time or event, especially in formal writing. Use with both specific times (until 5 PM) and events (until he arrives). Can be used at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse with "by" (which means "at or before," without implying continuation). Don't use "until" for starting points (use "from" or "since"). In very informal speech, "till" is often preferred over "until."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: until now, until then, until recently, until further notice, until the end, until tomorrow, until next week
   - **Verb + until**: wait until, stay until, work until, continue until, remain until, postpone until, delay until
   - **Subordinating conjunction**: [clause] until [clause] (e.g., "I'll wait until you're ready")
   - **Not... until**: (emphasis) not starting before a particular time (e.g., "The store doesn't open until 10 AM")
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "und" (up to) + "til" (to)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "oð" or "und" + "til" → Middle English "until" → Modern English "until"; combines the sense of "up to" with "till" (to a point)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm staying up until midnight to finish this game.
   - She won't know until you tell her.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The facility will remain closed until further notice.
   - Research continued until conclusive evidence was obtained.

2. **Preposition**: until such time as (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Up to the point when; continuing until a specified condition is met (formal, often bureaucratic)
   
   **Synonyms**: until, until the time when, pending
   
   **Antonyms**: from the time when, since
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal, legal, or bureaucratic contexts to emphasize the conditional nature of waiting for something to happen
   
   When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation as it sounds overly formal and bureaucratic; simple "until" is usually sufficient
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: until such time as necessary, until such time as appropriate
   - **Legal/Bureaucratic**: until such time as approval is granted, until such time as conditions are met
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + such + time + as (combining preposition with formal demonstrative and relative)
   
   **Etymology**: Formal extension of "until" combining with "such time as" for legal/bureaucratic emphasis, emerged in legal English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used in casual speech)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The suspension shall remain in effect until such time as the investigation is complete.
   - Operations will continue under current protocols until such time as new regulations are implemented.

3. **Preposition**: not until (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Only at the specified time or after the specified event; emphasizing that something doesn't happen before a particular point
   
   **Synonyms**: only after, only when, not before
   
   **Antonyms**: before, already by
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize that an action or state begins only at or after a specific time/event, not before
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with affirmative "until"; "not until" emphasizes the starting point, while "until" emphasizes continuation to an endpoint
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Negative emphasis**: It wasn't until [time/event] that [result]
   - **Not... until**: don't... until, won't... until, can't... until, didn't... until
   - **Fronted for emphasis**: Not until [time/event] did/was... (inverted structure)
   
   **Root Analysis**: not + until (negation + temporal preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Emphatic construction combining negation with "until" to stress late occurrence or delayed action
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I didn't understand it until you explained it.
   - We can't leave until everyone's ready.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Not until the data was analyzed did the pattern become apparent.
   - The policy's full impact was not evident until several years later.

4. **Preposition**: up until (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Continuously from an earlier time up to and including a specified point; emphasizing the entire duration
   
   **Synonyms**: until, up to, right until
   
   **Antonyms**: from, starting from
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize continuous duration or to stress that something continued right up to a particular point; more emphatic than simple "until"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Considered redundant by some style guides (since "up" adds little meaning to "until"); in formal academic writing, simple "until" may be preferred
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Emphasizing duration**: up until now, up until recently, up until that point, up until then
   - **Continuous state**: remained up until, continued up until, lasted up until
   
   **Root Analysis**: up + until (directional particle + temporal preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Emphatic combination adding "up" to "until" to stress continuous approach to a temporal endpoint, common in modern English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everything was fine up until yesterday.
   - I lived there up until I graduated.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The phenomenon remained unexplained up until recent discoveries.
   - Traditional methods were employed up until the introduction of digital technology.

5. **Preposition**: from... until (type: phrasal pattern)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Indicating a complete time span with both starting point and endpoint
   
   **Synonyms**: from... to, between... and
   
   **Antonyms**: (no direct antonym; this is a paired construction)
   
   **When to Use**: Use to specify both the beginning and end of a time period, creating a complete time frame
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't mix "from" with "to" when you mean "until" - use either "from... to" or "from... until" consistently
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Time spans**: from morning until night, from Monday until Friday, from start until finish
   - **Schedules**: from 9 AM until 5 PM, from January until December
   - **Life spans**: from birth until death, from beginning until end
   
   **Root Analysis**: from (Old English "fram") + until (Old English "und" + "til")
   
   **Etymology**: Paired construction combining starting point marker "from" with endpoint marker "until" to create bounded temporal expressions
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The store is open from 10 until 8 every day.
   - I'll be busy from now until next week.

   - **Emphasis**: right until the end, right until the last minute, right until now
   
   **Root Analysis**: right (intensifier) + until (temporal preposition)
