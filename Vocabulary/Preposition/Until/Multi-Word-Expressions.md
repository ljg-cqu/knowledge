# Multi-Word Expressions Related to: Until

1. **Expression**: wait until (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To delay action or remain patient until a specified time or event occurs; to postpone doing something
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common verb + preposition pairing)
   
   **Synonyms**: hold on until, delay until, postpone until, stay patient until
   
   **Antonyms**: proceed immediately, go ahead now, don't wait
   
   **When to Use**: Use for instructions, requests, or descriptions where action is deliberately postponed until conditions are right; common in coordination and planning contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound commanding without softeners like "please"; may seem passive or indecisive if overused
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - wait until [time/event]
   - wait here until
   - can't wait until (expressing eagerness)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Wait" naturally pairs with "until" because waiting inherently involves a temporal endpoint. The verb "wait" is durative and requires a temporal boundary marker, making "until" the natural choice for specifying when the waiting ends.
   
   **Root Analysis**: wait (Old English "wæcan" - to watch) + until (Old English "und" + "til")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just wait until you see what I got!
   - Wait until everyone's here before starting.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Please wait until confirmation is received before proceeding.
   - Participants are requested to wait until the presentation concludes.

2. **Expression**: not until (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Only at or after a specified time; emphasizing that something doesn't happen before a particular point
   - *Fixedness*: strong (negation + temporal marker creates emphatic meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: only when, only after, not before, not till
   
   **Antonyms**: already before, by the time, earlier than
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize timing, especially when something happens later than expected or when setting clear boundaries
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts where simple timing statement suffices; "not until" adds emphasis that may be unnecessary
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - not until [time/event]
   - it wasn't until [time] that...
   - not until then
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The negation "not" combines with "until" to create emphasis by eliminating all time before a specific point. This construction has become conventionalized as an emphatic temporal marker, stressing the late occurrence of events. The phrase evolved as a rhetorical device to highlight unexpected or significant timing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: not (Old English "not" - negation) + until
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I didn't understand it until you explained.
   - Not until I saw it myself did I believe it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The correlation was not identified until comprehensive analysis was performed.
   - Not until recent technological advances did this methodology become feasible.

3. **Expression**: up until (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Fixedness*: medium (directional particle + preposition for emphasis)
   
   **Synonyms**: until, right until, all the way until, up to
   
   **Antonyms**: from, starting from, after
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize continuous duration or to stress that something continued all the way to a particular point; more emphatic than simple "until"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Considered redundant by some style guides; in very formal academic writing, simple "until" may be preferred
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - up until now
   - up until recently
   - up until that point
   - right up until
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The particle "up" adds directional and progressive emphasis to "until," strengthening the sense of continuous approach toward a temporal endpoint. This combination conventionalized in modern English to stress unbroken continuation, distinguishing it from simple "until" through added emphasis.
   
   **Root Analysis**: up (directional particle) + until (temporal preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everything was fine up until yesterday.
   - I worked there up until last month.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The methodology remained standard up until recent innovations emerged.
   - Traditional approaches were employed up until technological advancement enabled alternatives.

4. **Expression**: until further notice (type: fixed phrase)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - remains in effect until further notice
   - closed until further notice
   - suspended until further notice
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: This bureaucratic formula combines "until" with "further notice" to create a legally precise yet flexible temporal boundary. Origin in administrative and military contexts where situations require indefinite but revocable timespans. The phrase became standardized in official communications for open-ended but changeable statuses.
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + further (comparative of "forth") + notice (Latin "notitia" - being known)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The pool is closed until further notice.
   - We're working from home until further notice.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - until such time as [condition]
   - shall remain until such time as
   - continues until such time as
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Legal English formula combining "until" with formal demonstrative "such" and relative "time as" to create precise, formal temporal conditions. Developed in legal and bureaucratic registers to emphasize conditionality and formality, distinguishing official documentation from casual speech. First known use in legal contexts, 17th-18th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + such (Old English "swilc" - of that kind) + time + as (relative)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used; sounds pretentious)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - until now, [new situation]
   - has been... until now
   - remained... until now
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Until" naturally combines with "now" to mark the present as a temporal boundary. This pairing is highly frequent because it marks transitions from past states to present conditions, a common communicative need. The phrase conventionalized as a discourse marker for introducing contrasts or changes.
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + now (Old English "nu" - present moment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I didn't know about this place until now.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - until very recently
   - until quite recently  
   - until recently, [past state], but now [new state]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Until" pairs with "recently" to mark endpoints in the near past, a common temporal reference need. This combination is conventional for indicating recent transitions, contrasting previous states with current ones. High frequency due to communicative need to mark recent changes.
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + recent (Latin "recens" - fresh, new) + -ly
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I lived there until recently.
   - Until recently, I thought he was married.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - until then, [intermediate action]
   - everything was... until then
   - will continue until then
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Until" naturally pairs with deictic "then" to reference contextually established time points. This combination is highly conventional because "then" provides flexible temporal reference (past/present/future) while "until" marks it as a boundary. Essential for narrative and discourse cohesion.
   
   **Root Analysis**: until + then (Old English "þænne" - at that time)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - See you at five. Until then, I'll be working.

   - *Fixedness*: strong (paired temporal markers creating frame)
   
   **Synonyms**: from [time] to [time], between [time] and [time]
   
   **Antonyms**: (no direct antonym; this creates bounded temporal frame)
   
   **When to Use**: Use to specify complete time ranges with both boundaries; essential for schedules, operating hours, and defined periods
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Maintain parallelism; use either "from...to" or "from...until" consistently, not mixed
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - from morning until night
   - from start until finish
   - from [date] until [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The paired markers "from" (starting point) and "until" (endpoint) create complete temporal frames, a fundamental communicative need. This pairing is conventional for schedules, durations, and bounded periods. The partnership reflects cognitive framing of time as linear with beginnings and ends.
   
   **Root Analysis**: from (Old English "fram") + until (Old English "und" + "til")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I work from nine until five.
   - The store is open from morning until night.

    **Common Variations**: 
    - hold out until [relief/resolution]
    - can you hold out until...?
    - managed to hold out until
    
    **Why This Partnership**: 
    - *For collocations*: The phrasal verb "hold out" (meaning persist/endure) naturally pairs with "until" because persistence requires a temporal goal or endpoint. This collocation emphasizes the duration of difficulty, making "until" the natural temporal marker for when relief arrives. Conventional in contexts of endurance, resistance, and perseverance.
    
    **Root Analysis**: hold (Old English "healdan") + out (particle) + until
    
    **Examples [Casual]**: 
    - Can you hold out until payday?
    - I'm trying to hold out until the weekend.
