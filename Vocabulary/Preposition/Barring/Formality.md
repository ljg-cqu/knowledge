   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher-status recipients (executives, senior clients) prefer "barring" or "unless"; peers allow "if nothing goes wrong"
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers/new clients require semi-formal "unless"; familiar colleagues accept casual forms
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Critical projects require formal/semi-formal; routine projects allow casual
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect more formal conditional expressions even in routine communications
   - *Medium*: Written reports lean formal; face-to-face allows casual; emails typically semi-formal
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "barring" in emails to close colleagues—sounds overly stiff and creates unnecessary distance
   - Using "if nothing goes wrong" in board presentations—sounds unprofessional and uncertain
   - Mixing registers: "Barring any stuff going wrong"—inconsistent register signals confusion
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In high-context cultures (East Asian, Latin American), even casual situations may require more formal conditional expressions to show respect. Anglo cultures generally accept more casual forms among peers.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Email to CEO about critical project → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("Barring any complications") because of high power distance and gravity
   - **Situation 2**: Slack message to project team → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("If nothing goes wrong") because low power/social distance, routine context
   - **Situation 3**: Client proposal document → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-formal ("Unless there are complications") because professional but not overly stiff

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "but" in formal written invitations—too casual and potentially ambiguous (confusing conjunction vs. preposition)
   - Using archaic "save" in casual conversation—sounds pretentious and creates social distance
   - Being too casual about serious exclusions—can seem insensitive or unprofessional
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Direct exclusion statements can be face-threatening in many cultures. Consider whether indirect phrasing ("John is unable to attend") might be more culturally appropriate, especially in high-context cultures.
