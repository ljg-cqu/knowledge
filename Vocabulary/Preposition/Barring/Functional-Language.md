1. **Functional Expression**: Barring [obstacle/condition], [statement] (function: expressing conditional prediction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to state that something will happen unless a specified obstacle or condition prevents it. Expresses conditional certainty with awareness of potential blocking factors.
   - *Formality*: formal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: Unless [condition], Except for [condition], Short of [obstacle], If not for [obstacle], Save [obstacle]
   
   **Antonyms**: Including [factor], Given [factor], With [factor] (expressing inclusion rather than exception)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when making predictions or commitments while acknowledging potential obstacles. Common in business planning, project management, event planning, and formal predictions. Appropriate when speaking to stakeholders about timelines or outcomes. Shows professional awareness of risk factors while expressing confidence.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversations where "unless" or "if" would sound more natural. Don't use when obstacles are highly likely—it would seem overly optimistic. Not appropriate when you need to sound absolutely certain without qualifications. Avoid with very serious obstacles (death, catastrophe) where it might sound flippant.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Barring unforeseen circumstances (most common, formal)
   - Barring any complications (professional, medical contexts)
   - Barring a miracle (informal, usually humorous, expressing low probability)
   - Barring interference/delays/problems (specific to context)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression serves as a hedge—it allows the speaker to make a commitment while protecting face if circumstances prevent fulfillment. Shows professional risk awareness. Creates reasonable expectations without appearing overly cautious.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Acknowledging: "Yes, barring the unexpected, that timeline works."
   - Challenging: "What specific circumstances are you concerned about?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A: "Will you make it to dinner?" B: "Barring any traffic disasters, I'll be there by seven."
   - Barring a zombie apocalypse, I'll definitely finish this by Friday!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Barring unforeseen regulatory delays, the merger will be finalized in Q3.
   - The committee anticipates reaching a decision next week, barring any complications.

1. **Functional Expression**: [X] is prohibited / not permitted (function: stating rules/restrictions)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to formally forbid an action, behavior, or item. States official rules, regulations, or policies that restrict behavior.
   - *Formality*: formal to very formal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] is forbidden, [X] is not allowed, [X] is banned, You must not [X], Do not [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] is permitted, [X] is allowed, [X] is authorized, You may [X]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when communicating official rules, regulations, policies, or restrictions. Common in institutional settings (schools, workplaces, government), legal contexts, safety instructions, and public signage. Appropriate when authority and compliance are important. Shows official enforcement capacity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in personal requests where it sounds authoritarian—use "please don't" instead. Not appropriate among equals unless citing official rules. Don't use for suggestions or preferences—only actual prohibitions. Avoid when building rapport or collaboration—too hierarchical.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - It is prohibited to [verb] (very formal, impersonal)
   - [X] is strictly prohibited (emphasis on enforcement)
   - [X] is expressly prohibited (legal emphasis)
   - [Noun phrase] is not permitted (formal, institutional)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression asserts institutional authority and expects compliance. It's face-threatening but legitimized by official status. Often accompanied by consequences ("violators will be..."). Impersonal phrasing reduces face threat. Used in public discourse to manage behavior.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Compliance: "Understood, I'll refrain from doing that."
   - Clarification: "Could you clarify what specific actions are prohibited?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Smoking is prohibited in the building—you have to go outside.
   - Photography is not permitted during the performance.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The unauthorized disclosure of confidential information is strictly prohibited.
   - Use of personal devices during examinations is expressly not permitted under university regulations.

1. **Functional Expression**: Unless [condition], [consequence] (function: stating conditional warnings/predictions)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to specify a condition that must be met to avoid a negative consequence, or the only circumstance under which something won't happen. Expresses conditional relationships, often with warning implications.
   - *Formality*: neutral (works in all registers)
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: If not [condition], Except if [condition], Barring [condition], Without [condition]
   
   **Antonyms**: If [condition], When [condition], Provided that [condition]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when stating conditions necessary to prevent outcomes, making predictions with exceptions, or giving conditional warnings. Works in all contexts from casual to formal. Appropriate for setting expectations, establishing conditions, or explaining requirements. Very versatile connector for conditional reasoning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when positive framing would be clearer—"if you do X" often clearer than "unless you don't do X." Don't use when threats are implied and you want to sound supportive. Can sound demanding in some contexts—consider softening with "might" or "may."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Unless otherwise stated/specified (formal, common in documents)
   - Unless absolutely necessary (emphasis on exceptionality)
   - Unless I'm mistaken (hedging, showing uncertainty)
   - Unless you hear otherwise (delegation, instructions)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Unless" creates conditional structures efficiently. Often used in warnings, where it's less face-threatening than direct commands. In formal writing, helps establish precise conditions. Can be softened with modal verbs ("might," "may") or strengthened with "only."
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting condition: "Understood, I'll make sure to do that."
   - Negotiating: "What if we modified the condition to...?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Unless you call me, I'll assume we're still meeting at six.
   - You can't come in unless you're wearing shoes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Unless the committee receives additional information by Friday, the application will be denied.
   - All submissions must be original work unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.

   - *Formality*: formal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: Except for [X], Excluding [X], Apart from [X], Save [X], Other than [X]
   
   **Antonyms**: Including [X], Together with [X], Along with [X]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing, official statements, legal documents, or professional communications when you need to precisely mark exceptions. Common in policy documents, contracts, academic writing, and formal reports. Appropriate when precision and formality are valued.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual speech where "except" or "but" would sound more natural. Don't use when trying to sound approachable or friendly—too formal. Not appropriate for everyday emails among colleagues—use simpler alternatives. Avoid when brevity is more important than formality.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - With the sole exception of (emphasizing uniqueness)
   - With certain exceptions (vague, multiple exceptions)
   - With few exceptions (general pattern with rare exceptions)
   - With no exceptions (emphasizing absolute rule)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression creates formal, precise exception marking. Often used in legal and official contexts where exactness matters. The formality creates authority and seriousness. Useful for avoiding ambiguity in policy statements.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Seeking clarification: "Could you specify which items are exceptions?"
   - Acknowledging: "Understood, all except [X]."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

1. **Functional Expression**: X is off-limits / out of bounds (function: informal restriction/prohibition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate that a place, topic, or thing is prohibited or restricted, especially in informal contexts. Implies boundaries that shouldn't be crossed.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (metaphorical)
   
   **Synonyms**: X is forbidden, Don't go near X, Stay away from X, X is restricted, X is no-go
   
   **Antonyms**: X is accessible, X is available, X is permitted, Feel free to [access X]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in casual or semi-formal contexts to indicate restrictions, especially physical boundaries or social/conversational boundaries. Common in parenting, casual workplace rules, social situations, and informal warnings. Softer than "prohibited" while still clear.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in formal legal or policy documents—use "prohibited" instead. Don't use when official, serious tone is required. Not appropriate in very formal written communication. Avoid when consequences are severe—needs stronger language.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - That topic is off-limits (conversational boundaries)
   - The basement is off-limits (physical boundaries)
   - That's out of bounds (British English preference)
   - Consider [X] off-limits (directive form)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: These expressions use spatial metaphors to indicate restrictions, making them less face-threatening than direct prohibitions. "Off-limits" is more American; "out of bounds" more British. Both are softer than "forbidden" while still establishing clear boundaries.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Compliance: "Got it, I'll stay away from there."
   - Questioning: "Why is that off-limits?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The garage is off-limits until Dad finishes his project in there.
   - Politics is off-limits at family dinners—we learned that the hard way.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The executive floor is off-limits to visitors without prior authorization.
   - During the investigation, discussion of the case details is strictly off-limits.
