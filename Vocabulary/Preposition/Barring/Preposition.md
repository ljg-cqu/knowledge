1. **Preposition**: barring (type: simple preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Except for; unless there is; if not prevented by (a particular circumstance or factor). Used to indicate that something will happen unless a specified condition prevents it.
   
   **Synonyms**: except for (in most contexts), unless (when followed by clause), save for (formal), excluding (in formal contexts), short of (informal)
   
   **Antonyms**: including, with, given
   
   **When to Use**: Use "barring" when you want to state that something will happen or is true unless a specific exception or obstacle occurs. Common in conditional statements, predictions, and planning contexts. Often used in formal and semi-formal writing and speech to express hypothetical obstacles.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual conversation where "unless" or "except" would sound more natural. Don't use "barring" when the exception is already known or certain (use "except for" instead). Not appropriate for spatial or temporal relationships—only for abstract conditional exceptions.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: barring accidents, barring unforeseen circumstances, barring a miracle, barring any problems, barring complications
   - **Sentence-initial position**: "Barring any delays, we'll arrive on time"
   - **Mid-sentence position**: "The project will finish on schedule, barring unexpected issues"
   - **Conditional constructions**: Often followed by noun phrases representing potential obstacles
   
   **Root Analysis**: bar (verb: to prevent, obstruct) + -ing (present participle suffix functioning as preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → From the verb "bar" (to obstruct, prevent) → Old French "barrer" (to bar, block) → Vulgar Latin "barrare" → Late Latin "barra" (barrier, bar)

   - **Prepositional phrases**: save for, save one, save the exception
   - **Absolute constructions**: "All were present, save John"
   - **Clause-final position**: "Nothing remains save memories"
   - **Literary expressions**: "save grace", "save that..."
   
   **Root Analysis**: From the verb "save" (to make safe, preserve) → extended meaning of "except for"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "sauf" → Old French "sauf, sauver" (to save, preserve) → Latin "salvare" (to save) → "salvus" (safe, uninjured)

   **When to Use**: Use "but" as a preposition after negative or near-negative words to indicate the sole exception. Common in expressions like "nothing but," "all but," "no one but." Appropriate in all registers from casual to formal.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use "but" as a preposition after positive statements (use "except" or "except for" instead). Avoid confusion with "but" as a coordinating conjunction. Not typically used in sentence-initial position as "barring" or "except for" can be.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **After negatives**: nothing but, nobody but, none but
   - **After "all"**: all but impossible, all but finished
   - **After question words**: who but, what but, where but
   - **Fixed expressions**: "last but not least", "anything but"
   
   **Root Analysis**: Simple word; no meaningful component breakdown
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "būtan" (outside, without, except) → "be" (by) + "ūtan" (outside)
