   **Common Phrases**: 
   - exceptional circumstances
   - exceptional quality
   - exceptional case
   - exceptionally talented

   **Root Analysis**: exception (noun) + -al (adjective suffix: relating to)

   - conditional agreement
   - subject to conditional terms
   
   **Root Analysis**: condition (noun) + -al (adjective suffix: relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "condicio/conditio" (agreement, condition) → "condicere" (to agree) → Old French "condicion" → English "condition" + "-al"

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you want to emphasize inclusion and accessibility. Don't use in formal writing when "sole" or "only" would be clearer. Be cautious of negative connotations around exclusivity and elitism.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - exclusive rights
   - exclusive access
   - exclusive interview
   - mutually exclusive
   - exclusive membership
   
   **Root Analysis**: exclude (verb) + -ive (adjective suffix: tending to, having the quality of)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "excludere" (to shut out) → "ex-" (out) + "claudere" (to close) → Medieval Latin "exclusivus" → English "exclusive"

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "not allowed" or "can't" would be more natural. Don't use when something is merely discouraged rather than forbidden. Not appropriate when describing personal preferences rather than rules.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - strictly prohibited
   - prohibited items
   - prohibited area
   - prohibited by law
   - prohibited substances
   
   **Root Analysis**: prohibit (verb) + -ed (past participle functioning as adjective)

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal legal writing where "prohibited" might be clearer. Don't use casually when "not allowed" would suffice. Not appropriate for temporary restrictions—"barred" implies a formal, usually lasting exclusion.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - barred from entry
   - barred from participation
   - barred window
   - barred door
   - permanently barred
