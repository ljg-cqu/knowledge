1. **Verb**: bar
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To prevent or forbid someone from doing something or going somewhere; to officially exclude or prohibit. Often used with "from" to indicate what is prevented.
   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive) To fasten or secure something with a bar or barrier; to block or obstruct physically.
   
   **Synonyms**: prohibit, forbid, ban, exclude, prevent, block, obstruct
   
   **Antonyms**: permit, allow, admit, authorize, grant access, welcome
   
   **When to Use**: Use "bar" when referring to formal exclusion, official prohibition, or physical blocking. Common in legal, institutional, and formal contexts. Often used with "from" + gerund/noun ("bar from entering"). Appropriate when discussing formal restrictions or access control. Works across registers but particularly common in formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual contexts where "not let" or "not allow" would be simpler. Don't use when prohibition is informal or temporary—"bar" suggests official, lasting exclusion. Not appropriate for polite requests where it would sound authoritarian.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - bar someone from (doing something)
   - bar entry/access
   - bar the door/gate
   - be barred from
   - legally barred
   
   **Root Analysis**: From the noun "bar" (barrier, obstruction); verb derived from noun
   
   **Etymology**: Old French "barrer" (to bar, block) → Vulgar Latin "barrare" → Late Latin "barra" (barrier, bar)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They barred him from the club after that incident.
   - The bouncer barred them from entering without ID.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The court's ruling bars the defendant from contacting any of the plaintiffs.
   - Security protocols bar unauthorized personnel from accessing sensitive areas.

1. **Verb**: exclude
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To deliberately not include someone or something; to prevent from entering or participating; to keep out intentionally.
   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive) To decide that something is not possible or that it should not be considered; to rule out.
   
   **Synonyms**: leave out, omit, bar, ban, prohibit, reject, shut out
   
   **Antonyms**: include, admit, incorporate, welcome, embrace, involve
   
   **When to Use**: Use "exclude" when referring to deliberate non-inclusion, intentional keeping out, or ruling out possibilities. Common in formal and neutral contexts discussing membership, participation, consideration, or analysis. Appropriate when discussing discrimination, selective criteria, or logical reasoning. Works across registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when omission is accidental—"exclude" implies intentional action. Don't use when "not include" would be simpler and clearer in casual contexts. Not appropriate when describing neutral non-application rather than deliberate exclusion.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - exclude from
   - exclude the possibility
   - feel excluded
   - exclude someone/something
   - deliberately exclude
   
   **Root Analysis**: ex- (out, from) + -clude (from Latin "claudere" = to close, shut)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "excludere" (to shut out, keep out) → "ex-" (out) + "claudere" (to close) → Middle English "excluden"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They excluded him from the group chat, which really hurt his feelings.
   - We can't exclude the possibility that she's right.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study excluded participants who did not meet the specified eligibility criteria.
   - The analysis excludes outliers that would otherwise skew the results.

1. **Verb**: prohibit
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To formally forbid something by law, rule, or authority; to make something illegal or not allowed officially.
   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive) To prevent something from happening; to make something impossible through official means.
   
   **Synonyms**: forbid, ban, bar, outlaw, proscribe, disallow
   
   **Antonyms**: permit, allow, authorize, sanction, approve, legalize
   
   **When to Use**: Use "prohibit" when referring to formal, official forbidding through laws, rules, or regulations. Common in legal, regulatory, institutional, and formal policy contexts. More formal than "forbid" or "ban." Appropriate when discussing official restrictions with enforcement capability. Typically followed by noun or gerund.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "not allow" or "forbid" would sound more natural. Don't use for informal social rules—too formal. Not appropriate when making personal requests—use "please don't." Too authoritarian for collaborative contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - prohibit from (doing something)
   - strictly prohibited
   - prohibited by law
   - prohibit the use of
   - legally prohibit
   
   **Root Analysis**: pro- (before, forward) + -hibit (from Latin "habere" = to hold, have)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "prohibere" (to keep from, prevent, hinder) → "pro-" (before) + "habere" (to hold) → Old French "prohibir" → Middle English "prohibiten"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The rules prohibit bringing outside food into the theater.
   - Smoking is prohibited in all indoor areas.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To limit the size, amount, or range of something; to put a limit on what someone can do or where they can go; to control or constrain.
   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive) To prevent someone from doing something or going somewhere by means of rules or laws.
   
   **Synonyms**: limit, constrain, control, confine, regulate, curtail
   
   **Antonyms**: expand, extend, free, liberate, allow, open up
   
   **When to Use**: Use "restrict" when referring to limiting the scope, extent, access, or freedom of something without complete prohibition. Common in regulatory, policy, and formal contexts. Less severe than "prohibit"—allows limited versions rather than complete bans. Appropriate when discussing controlled access or limited permissions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when complete prohibition is meant—use "prohibit" or "ban" instead. Don't use when expansion or opening up would be more accurate. Not appropriate when describing generous allowances—"restrict" emphasizes limitations.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - restrict access to
   - restrict the use of
   - severely restricted
   - restrict someone's freedom
   - restrict to (certain people/uses)
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (back, again) + -strict (from Latin "stringere" = to bind, draw tight)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "restrictus" (past participle of "restringere" = to bind back, confine, limit) → "re-" (back) + "stringere" (to bind tight) → French "restreindre" → English "restrict"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They're restricting access to the pool during renovations.
   - The doctor told him to restrict his salt intake.

   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive, archaic) To come before in time; to precede.
   
   **Synonyms**: stop, hinder, impede, obstruct, block, thwart, forestall
   
   **Antonyms**: allow, enable, facilitate, cause, promote, encourage
   
   **When to Use**: Use "prevent" when referring to stopping something from occurring or making something impossible. Common across all registers and contexts. Often followed by noun or "from" + gerund. Appropriate when discussing protective measures, obstacles, or proactive stopping. Very versatile and common verb.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when causation of outcomes (rather than stopping them) is meant—use "cause" or "enable" instead. Don't use when the action failed—"tried to prevent" if unsuccessful. Not appropriate when describing neutral non-occurrence without active prevention.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - prevent from (doing something)
   - prevent something (from) happening
   - take steps to prevent
   - prevent access
   - prevent the spread of
   
   **Root Analysis**: pre- (before) + -vent (from Latin "venire" = to come)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "praevenire" (to come before, anticipate, hinder) → "prae-" (before) + "venire" (to come) → French "prévenir" → Middle English "preventen"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Lock the door to prevent anyone from getting in.
   - Nothing can prevent me from going to that concert!

   **Synonyms**: prohibit, ban, disallow, bar, proscribe, outlaw
   
   **Antonyms**: permit, allow, authorize, approve, sanction, enable
   
   **When to Use**: Use "forbid" when referring to direct orders or commands not to do something, or when circumstances make something impossible. Common with personal authority (parents, teachers) or strong prohibitions. Often followed by object + "to" + infinitive or "from" + gerund. Less formal than "prohibit" but more emphatic than "not allow."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal legal contexts where "prohibit" is more precise. Don't use when making polite requests—too authoritarian. Not appropriate in collaborative contexts where it sounds dictatorial. Be aware of potentially archaic tone in some contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - forbid someone to do something
   - forbid someone from doing something
   - strictly forbid
   - God/Heaven forbid (idiomatic: expressing hope that something doesn't happen)

   **Root Analysis**: for- (intensive prefix) + bid (from Old English "bēodan" = to command, announce)
