1. **Adverb**: exceptionally (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To an unusual degree; extraordinarily; remarkably. Used to intensify adjectives or verbs, indicating that something is far beyond the normal level.
   - *(Sense 2)* As an exception to the usual rule; in exceptional cases. (sentence adverb)
   
   **Synonyms**: extraordinarily, unusually, remarkably, extremely, particularly
   
   **Antonyms**: ordinarily, typically, normally, commonly, usually
   
   **When to Use**: Use "exceptionally" to emphasize that something is far beyond normal standards, either in quality, degree, or as an exception. Can modify adjectives (exceptionally good), verbs (performed exceptionally), or entire sentences (exceptionally, we will allow this). Appropriate in both formal and informal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing as a mere intensifier when "very" or "really" would suffice. Don't use when describing something only slightly above average. Not appropriate in contexts requiring precise quantification.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - exceptionally well
   - exceptionally high
   - exceptionally talented
   - perform exceptionally
   - exceptionally rare
   
   **Root Analysis**: exceptional (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "exceptio" → exception → exceptional + "-ly"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She did exceptionally well on the test—way better than expected.

1. **Adverb**: conditionally (type: manner)

   **Synonyms**: provisionally, contingently, tentatively, subject to conditions, with conditions
   
   **Antonyms**: unconditionally, absolutely, definitely, categorically, certainly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "conditionally" when describing an action or state that depends on certain conditions being fulfilled. Common in legal, business, and academic contexts. Often used with verbs like "approve," "accept," "grant," "agree."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "depending on" or "if" would be clearer. Don't use when conditions are implicit or obvious from context. Not appropriate when describing unconditional actions.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - conditionally approved
   - conditionally accepted
   - conditionally granted
   - agree conditionally
   - offered conditionally
   
   **Root Analysis**: conditional (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)

   **Synonyms**: solely, only, purely, uniquely, alone
   
   **Antonyms**: inclusively, broadly, generally, widely, universally
   
   **When to Use**: Use "exclusively" to emphasize that something is restricted to a particular person, group, purpose, or situation with no other inclusions. Common in business, marketing, and formal contexts. Can be used mid-sentence or before the verb.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when some inclusion is actually present—"exclusively" means completely restricted with no exceptions. Don't use when "mainly" or "primarily" would be more accurate. Be cautious of elitist connotations in some contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - focus exclusively on
   - deal exclusively with
   - available exclusively
   - work exclusively for
   - exclusively designed for
   
   **Root Analysis**: exclusive (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "excludere" → exclude → exclusive + "-ly"

   **Synonyms**: completely, totally, entirely, utterly, wholly, unconditionally
   
   **Antonyms**: partially, somewhat, conditionally, relatively, moderately
   
   **When to Use**: Use "absolutely" to emphasize completeness or totality, to express strong agreement, or to indicate that something is true without qualification. Can modify adjectives (absolutely necessary), verbs (absolutely refuse), or stand alone as emphatic agreement. Works in all registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing as a mere intensifier—can weaken impact through repetition. Don't use when partial truth or conditionality is present. Be aware it can sound emphatic or dramatic in neutral contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - absolutely necessary
   - absolutely refuse
   - absolutely right
   - absolutely nothing
   - Absolutely! (as agreement)
   
   **Root Analysis**: absolute (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "absolutus" (complete, finished) → "absolvere" (to set free, complete) → absolute + "-ly"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm absolutely starving—let's eat right now!

   **When to Use**: Use "otherwise" to introduce an alternative outcome, to indicate different circumstances, or to link contrasting ideas. Common in conditional statements, instructions, and formal reasoning. Can be sentence-initial, mid-sentence, or clause-final.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when "or else" might sound threatening (use "if not" instead). Don't use when the alternative is obvious or when clearer phrasing is possible. Can be formal or stuffy in very casual contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - otherwise known as
   - unless otherwise stated
   - prove otherwise
   - think otherwise
   - otherwise identical
   
   **Root Analysis**: other (adjective) + -wise (adverb suffix: in the manner of)

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need to leave now; otherwise, we'll be late.
