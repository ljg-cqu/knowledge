   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce specific examples or items that are part of a larger category or statement

   **Synonyms**: such as, like (informal), for example, for instance, namely
   
   **Antonyms**: excluding, except for, apart from, but not, other than (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: When providing examples within a category; lists and enumerations; specifying particular members of a set; all registers from casual to formal
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the list is exhaustive (use "consisting of" or "comprising" instead); when you want to exclude items (use "excluding" or "except")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [General statement] + including + [specific examples/noun phrase]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence (after noun phrase), occasionally sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: Can use comma before "including" for emphasis or clarity, especially in longer sentences
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use "including" when the examples are the complete list (not just examples)
   
   **Root Analysis**: in- (into) + clud- (close, shut) + -ing (present participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin includere (to enclose, contain) → including (present participle used prepositionally)

   - [Position]: mid-sentence after the noun being exemplified
   - [Punctuation]: Usually no comma before "such as" unless needed for complex sentences
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "Such as for example" is redundant—choose one or the other
   
   **Root Analysis**: such (of that kind) + as (like, in the same way)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English swilc (of such a kind) + as → "such as" phrase (Middle English)
