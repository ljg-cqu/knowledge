1. **Expression**: including but not limited to (type: fixed legal phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal expression used to introduce examples while explicitly stating that the list is not exhaustive
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed phrase, especially in legal contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: such as without limitation, among other things, for example but not exclusively, inter alia (Latin legal term)
   
   **Antonyms**: consisting solely of, limited to, exclusively, only (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Legal documents, contracts, formal policies, terms and conditions, formal business agreements requiring precision
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (sounds overly legalistic), informal writing, everyday communication where simpler language works
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - including without limitation
   - including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing
   - including but not restricted to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: This is standard legal language designed to prevent unintended limitations. "But not limited to" explicitly clarifies that examples don't exclude other items, protecting against restrictive interpretation in legal disputes. Originated in contract law to avoid ambiguity.
   
   **Root Analysis**: including (in- + clud-) + but (conjunction) + not (negation) + limited (bounded) + to (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Rarely used in casual contexts—would sound pretentious]
   - You can use it for many things, including but not limited to work and school. [too formal for casual speech]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - Participants must comply with all applicable laws, including but not limited to data protection regulations and safety standards.

1. **Expression**: all-inclusive (type: compound adjective/collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Including everything or everyone; with all costs, items, or people covered without additional charges
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed compound especially in hospitality/tourism)
   
   **Synonyms**: comprehensive, inclusive, complete package, full-service, everything included
   
   **Antonyms**: à la carte, selective, exclusive, pay-per-item, additional charges apply (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Travel and hospitality industry, describing packages or deals, business offerings, emphasizing value and completeness
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When items are sold separately, in contexts where itemization is preferred, when exclusivity is valued
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - all-inclusive package
   - all-inclusive resort
   - all-inclusive price/rate
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "All-inclusive" became strongly associated with vacation packages in the tourism industry (mid-20th century). The hyphenated compound emphasizes totality and convenience, appealing to consumers who want simplicity and no hidden costs. Strong partnership due to marketing/branding origins.
   
   **Root Analysis**: all (every) + inclusive (in- + clud- + -ive)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're booking an all-inclusive resort so we don't have to worry about costs.
   - The all-inclusive deal covers flights, hotels, and meals.

   - Including or covering something specified; with something contained or counted as part
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred phrase in formal contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: including, with [X] included, covering, encompassing, containing
   
   **Antonyms**: exclusive of, excluding, not including, without (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal business writing, pricing statements, technical specifications, academic writing, legal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (simpler alternatives sound more natural), informal writing where "including" works fine
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - price inclusive of tax
   - inclusive of all fees
   - range inclusive of endpoints
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Inclusive of" is more formal than "including" and emphasizes the containing relationship. Common in British English, especially for pricing ("£100 inclusive of VAT"). The "of" makes it a proper prepositional phrase allowing it to follow nouns more naturally than "including."
   
   **Root Analysis**: inclusive (in- + clud- + -ive) + of (preposition indicating possession/content)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The price is £50, inclusive of everything.
   - All ages are welcome, inclusive of children.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The quoted price is £10,000, inclusive of all taxes and installation charges.

1. **Expression**: including yourself/myself/himself/herself/themselves (type: reflexive pronoun collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explicitly stating that the speaker or subject is also counted in the group mentioned
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common collocation with reflexive pronouns)
   
   **Synonyms**: you/I/he/she/they included, counting yourself/myself, even yourself/myself
   
   **Antonyms**: excluding yourself/myself, not counting yourself/myself (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing personal inclusion in a group, clarifying membership, all registers from casual to formal
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When self-inclusion is obvious and doesn't need emphasis; can sound redundant
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - including me/you/him/her/them (non-reflexive variant)
   - yourself/myself included (inverted form)
   - everyone including yourself
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The reflexive pronoun after "including" serves to emphasize the subject's membership in the group, often expressing surprise, modesty, or clarification. Natural pairing because reflexive pronouns circle back to the subject, and "including" extends category membership.
   
   **Root Analysis**: including + reflexive pronoun (your/my/him/her/them + self/selves)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Five of us are going, including yourself!
   - Everyone contributed, including myself.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee, including myself, voted in favor of the proposal.
   - All stakeholders, including yourself, will receive notification of the decision.

1. **Expression**: including everyone/everything (type: collocation with universal quantifiers)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Emphasizing that absolutely all people or things are included without exception
   - *Fixedness*: medium (frequent collocation for emphasis)
   
   **Synonyms**: absolutely everyone/everything, all without exception, every single one, leaving no one/nothing out
   
   **Antonyms**: excluding some, not everyone/everything, selective, partial (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing completeness or universality, ensuring no exclusions, policies and announcements, all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When there are actually exceptions (factual inaccuracy), when you want to highlight specific subgroups rather than totality
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - everyone including [specific person]
   - everything including [specific item]
   - all [noun], including everyone/everything
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Including everyone/everything" combines the additive nature of "including" with universal quantifiers for maximum emphatic completeness. The partnership creates rhetorical emphasis that neither word achieves alone—"including" shows addition while "everyone/everything" establishes totality.
   
   **Root Analysis**: including + everyone (every + one) / everything (every + thing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The invitation is for everyone, including everyone from the office.
   - We packed everything, including everything we might possibly need.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The policy applies to all employees, including everyone in leadership positions.

1. **Expression**: up to and including (type: fixed phrase for range specification)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Specifying a range that includes the upper limit mentioned; emphasizing that the endpoint is part of the range
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed phrase particularly in technical and formal contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: through and including, from [X] to [Y] inclusive, as far as and including, up through
   
   **Antonyms**: up to but not including, up to but excluding, less than (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Technical specifications, date ranges, mathematical intervals, legal documents, formal instructions requiring precision
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation where simpler alternatives work, when endpoint exclusion is intended
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - from [date] up to and including [date]
   - ages [X] up to and including [Y]
   - sections 1 up to and including 5
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: This phrase emerged from need for precision in technical and legal contexts. "Up to" alone is ambiguous about whether the endpoint is included, so "and including" was added for clarity. Strong fixedness due to specialized precision requirements in formal domains.
   
   **Root Analysis**: up to (reaching as far as) + and (conjunction) + including (containing within)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone from age 5 up to and including age 12 gets in free.
   - Read chapters 1 up to and including chapter 7.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The regulations apply to all documents dated from January 1, 2020, up to and including December 31, 2023.
   - Participants aged 18 up to and including 65 years are eligible for enrollment.

1. **Expression**: not including / excluding (type: negated prepositional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explicitly stating what is not part of a package, price, or category; clarifying exclusions
   - *Fixedness*: medium (standard phrase for exclusion)
   
   **Synonyms**: excluding, without, not counting, minus, less, apart from
   
   **Antonyms**: including, with, counting, plus (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Pricing transparency, setting boundaries, avoiding misunderstandings, business transactions, all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When emphasis should be on what IS included (positive framing), marketing contexts preferring positive language
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - not including [item]
   - [price] not including tax
   - excluding [item]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Not including" creates a negative inclusion statement, essential for transparency and boundary-setting. The explicit negation clarifies what's outside scope, preventing assumptions. Common in legal and commercial contexts where clarity prevents disputes.
   
   **Root Analysis**: not (negation) + including (in- + clud- + -ing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The dinner costs $30, not including drinks.
   - We'll be gone for a week, not including travel days.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The base price is $50,000, not including taxes, delivery, or installation services.
   - The policy covers all employees, not including temporary contractors or consultants.

1. **Expression**: including, among others (type: discourse phrase for non-exhaustive listing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introducing examples while explicitly signaling that additional items exist beyond those mentioned
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common academic and formal writing pattern)
   
   **Synonyms**: such as, inter alia, for example (among other things), to name just a few
   
   **Antonyms**: consisting only of, exclusively, limited to (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Academic writing, formal reports, when providing representative examples without claiming completeness
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the list is actually complete, casual conversation (unnecessarily wordy), when brevity is valued
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - including [examples], among others
   - among others, including [examples]
   - including [X], [Y], and [Z], among others
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combining "including" (which introduces examples) with "among others" (which signals non-exhaustiveness) creates explicit hedging. This pairing is common in academic writing to provide examples while avoiding claims of completeness, protecting the author from criticism of omission.
   
   **Root Analysis**: including + among (in the midst of) + others (additional items)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We visited many cities, including Paris, London, and Rome, among others.
   - I play several instruments, including guitar and piano, among others.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: far-reaching including (type: collocation emphasizing extensive scope)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing something with broad impact or coverage that includes specific significant elements
   - *Fixedness*: weak (flexible collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: extensive including, comprehensive including, broad including, wide-ranging including
   
   **Antonyms**: limited including, narrow including, restricted to (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Formal writing, policy discussions, impact assessments, emphasizing scope and significance
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When scope is actually limited, casual contexts, when specificity matters more than scope
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - far-reaching effects including...
   - far-reaching implications including...
   - far-reaching changes including...
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Far-reaching" establishes broad scope, while "including" then specifies particular noteworthy elements within that scope. The combination allows writers to claim broad impact while providing concrete examples, balancing generality with specificity.
   
   **Root Analysis**: far-reaching (extending over a great distance) + including
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The storm had far-reaching effects, including power outages across the state.
   - He made far-reaching changes, including a complete reorganization.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The legislation will have far-reaching implications, including significant impacts on healthcare delivery and insurance markets.

1. **Expression**: including, in particular (type: discourse phrase for emphasis within examples)

   - Introducing examples while highlighting one or more as especially important or noteworthy
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common pattern for emphasis)
   
   **Synonyms**: including, especially, including, notably, such as, particularly
   
   **Antonyms**: excluding, particularly, generally without specific emphasis (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: Academic and professional writing, when some examples deserve special emphasis, analytical discussions

   **Common Variations**: 
   - including [examples], particularly [emphasized item]
   - including, especially [emphasized item]
   - including [list], in particular [highlighted item]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combining "including" (which lists) with "in particular" (which emphasizes) creates a two-stage rhetorical move: first showing range, then highlighting specific significance. Common in academic writing to balance breadth (inclusion) with depth (particular focus).
   
   **Root Analysis**: including + in particular (in + particular "specific")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like many genres, including, in particular, science fiction.
   - We visited several museums, including, in particular, the art museum.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Meaning**:

   - *Fixedness*: strong (established collocation in DEI - Diversity, Equity, Inclusion contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: welcoming environment/culture, diverse and inclusive, equitable, accessible to all
   
   **Antonyms**: exclusive environment, discriminatory policy, segregated, restrictive (if applicable)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - inclusive workplace
   - inclusive practices
   - inclusive design
   - inclusive leadership
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Inclusive" + environment/culture/policy became strongly associated in late 20th/early 21st century with diversity and inclusion initiatives. The pairing reflects organizational commitment to welcoming all people. Strong fixedness due to DEI movement, HR terminology, and legal/compliance requirements.
   
   **Root Analysis**: inclusive (in- + clud- + -ive) + environment/culture/policy (organizational concepts)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our company is working hard to create a more inclusive environment.

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Comprehensive" establishes thoroughness while "including" provides specific examples demonstrating that thoroughness. Common in academic and professional writing where claims of comprehensiveness need concrete support through examples.
   
   **Root Analysis**: comprehensive (com- + prehens- + -ive) + including
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
