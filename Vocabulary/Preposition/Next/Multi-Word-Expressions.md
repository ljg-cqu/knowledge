1. **Expression**: next to nothing (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Fixedness*: strong (words must appear in this exact order)
   
   **Synonyms**: almost nothing, very little, hardly anything, barely anything, practically nothing
   
   **Antonyms**: a lot, plenty, substantial amount, considerable
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize extreme scarcity or minimal quantity; informal to neutral register

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Next to" (proximity meaning) combined with "nothing" creates scale comparison—so close to nothing it's practically equivalent; metaphorical use of spatial proximity for quantity
   
   **Root Analysis**: next (nearest) + to (preposition) + nothing (zero)
