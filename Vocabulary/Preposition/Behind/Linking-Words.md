# Extract Linking Words & Discourse Markers for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract linking words (conjunctions, connectors, discourse markers, transition expressions) that are essential for constructing complex sentences and expressing logical relationships from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one linking word or discourse marker with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, grammatical function, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all linking words that connect clauses, phrases, words, or ideas
- Prioritize: subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, correlative pairs, logical connectors, discourse markers, transition phrases
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact linking expressions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both grammatical conjunctions and discourse-level connectors

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in linking words actually present in source
- Never invent linking words not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- **Coordinating conjunctions** (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
- **Subordinating conjunctions** (because, although, if, when, while, since, etc.)
- **Correlative conjunctions** (either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also)
- **Logical connectors** (cause/effect, contrast, addition, sequence)
- **Discourse markers** (organize discourse, signal shifts, manage turns)
- **Transition phrases** (between topics, ideas, paragraphs)
- **Cohesive devices** (reference, substitution markers)

**Format:**
- **Linking Word**: [word/phrase] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative/connector/discourse marker)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain grammatical or discourse function clearly*
  - *Describe logical relationship created*
  - *Include clause patterns and register information*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative linking words with same function
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 linking words expressing opposite logical relationship (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or registers where this linking word is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this linking word would be inappropriate or create grammatical/logical errors
- **Common Patterns**: Grammatical structures, punctuation rules, sentence positions
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (if applicable)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

1. **Linking Word**: behind (type: preposition used in causal/explanatory discourse)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce the underlying cause, reason, or explanation for something
   - *Function*: establishes causal or explanatory relationship; often used with nouns to form prepositional phrases that function as discourse connectors
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, as a result of, on account of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding (concessive, not causal)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when introducing causes, explanations, motivations, or underlying factors; appropriate across all registers; common in analytical and explanatory discourse
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Behind" is less formal than "due to" or "owing to" for pure causation; not used as a subordinating conjunction like "because" (requires noun phrase, not clause)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Result/Effect] + behind + [Noun Phrase = Cause]
     - Example: "The reason behind the decision..." / "The factors behind the crisis..."
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence after nouns like "reason," "story," "truth," "force," "motivation"
   - [Punctuation]: follows standard prepositional phrase rules; commas based on sentence flow
   - [Common errors to avoid]: *Cannot introduce clause (WRONG: "behind it was raining"); must be followed by noun phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by, around) + hind (back, rear) — metaphorical extension to hidden causes
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *behindan* (spatial "at the back") → metaphorical extension to "hidden/underlying cause" (1600s-present)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There's got to be more to the story behind why they suddenly canceled the event.
   - I'm trying to figure out what's behind all these technical problems we keep having.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - This study examines the socioeconomic factors behind the demographic shifts observed in urban centers.
   - Understanding the mechanisms behind climate change requires interdisciplinary research approaches.

**NOTE**: "Behind" is primarily a preposition rather than a true linking word or discourse marker. However, when used in constructions like "the reason behind," "the cause behind," or "the motivation behind," it functions in discourse to establish explanatory/causal relationships between ideas. Unlike conjunctions that link clauses, "behind" introduces noun phrases that explain or provide causation.

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on linking words that are essential for complex sentences and coherent communication
- Prioritize linking words with learning value (subordinating conjunctions, formal connectors, subtle distinctions)
- Clearly indicate grammatical patterns, punctuation rules, and register restrictions
- Distinguish between grammatical conjunctions (sentence-level) and discourse markers (text-level)
