# Extract Adjectives for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract adjectives (descriptive words, attributes, qualifiers) that are essential for language mastery from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one adjective with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all adjectives that are decision-critical for understanding the text
- Prioritize: precise descriptive adjectives, technical descriptors, evaluative adjectives, and adjectives with nuanced meanings
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact adjectives)
- Do not skip sections; cover both common and specialized descriptive vocabulary

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in adjectives actually present in source
- Never invent adjectives not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Precise descriptive adjectives with specific meanings
- Evaluative and opinion adjectives
- Technical or domain-specific descriptors
