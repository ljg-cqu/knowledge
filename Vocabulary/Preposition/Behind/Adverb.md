# Extract Adverbs for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract adverbs (manner, degree, frequency, time, place) that are essential for language mastery from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one adverb with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all adverbs that are decision-critical for understanding the text
- Prioritize: adverbs of manner, degree modifiers, discourse markers, sentence adverbs, and adverbs with nuanced meanings
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact adverbs)
- Do not skip sections; cover both common and specialized adverbial expressions

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in adverbs actually present in source
- Never invent adverbs not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Adverbs of manner (how something happens)
- Adverbs of degree (intensity, extent)
- Sentence adverbs (modify entire sentence, express attitude)
- Linking adverbs (discourse markers, transitions)
- Adverbs with precise or nuanced meanings

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Adverb**: behind (type: place)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In, at, or to a position at the back; in a place already passed or left
   - *(Sense 2)* In a state of making less progress than expected or required; late
   - *Position*: typically end position, occasionally mid-position with certain verbs
   
   **Synonyms**: at the back, in the rear, to the rear, at the rear, rearward
   
   **Antonyms**: ahead, in front, forward, before
   
   **When to Use**: Use to describe spatial position at the rear, lagging progress, or remaining in a place after others have left; appropriate across all registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not typically used in front position; avoid confusion with "behindhand" (archaic adverb meaning "late")
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stay behind
   - fall behind
   - lag behind
   - come from behind (to win)
   - look behind
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by, around) + hind (back, rear) — functioning as adverb without suffix
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *behindan* (adverb/preposition) → Middle English → Modern English "behind" (adverb use preserved)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You guys go ahead; I'll catch up. I'm staying behind to clean up.
   - The other runners are way behind now—she's going to win easily.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Students who fall behind academically often require additional support services.
