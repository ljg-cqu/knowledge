# Extract Prepositions for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract prepositions (simple, compound, phrasal prepositions) that are essential for expressing spatial, temporal, and abstract relationships from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one preposition with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, common patterns, prepositional phrases, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all prepositions expressing relationships between elements
- Prioritize: prepositions with multiple meanings, abstract/metaphorical uses, prepositional phrases, and prepositions commonly confused by learners
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and challenging prepositions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both literal and figurative uses

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in prepositions actually present in source
- Never invent prepositions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Simple prepositions (in, on, at, by, with, for, to, from, etc.)
- Compound prepositions (into, onto, upon, throughout, etc.)
- Phrasal prepositions (in front of, on behalf of, in spite of, etc.)
- Spatial relationships (location, direction, movement)
- Temporal relationships (time, duration, sequence)
- Abstract relationships (agency, purpose, manner, possession)
- Dependent prepositions (verb + preposition, adjective + preposition)

**Format:**
- **Preposition**: [word/phrase] (type: simple/compound/phrasal)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *If preposition has multiple senses, number them clearly*
  - *Cover spatial, temporal, and abstract meanings*
  - *Use simple, clear language to explain relationships*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 prepositions with similar meaning (in specific contexts)
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 prepositions with opposite meaning (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or relationships where this preposition is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this preposition would be incorrect (common learner errors)
- **Common Patterns**: 
  - Prepositional phrases
  - Verb + preposition combinations
  - Adjective + preposition combinations
  - Noun + preposition combinations
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (for compound prepositions)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Preposition**: behind (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* At or to the back or far side of something; in a position further back than something else
   - *(Temporal)* Later than; not keeping up with a schedule or expected progress
   - *(Abstract)* Responsible for; supporting or endorsing; the cause or explanation of something
   
   **Synonyms**: at the back of (spatial), after (temporal), backing (abstract support), responsible for (causation), lagging (progress)
   
   **Antonyms**: in front of, ahead of, before, leading
   
   **When to Use**: Use for spatial positions (location at the rear), temporal comparisons (delayed progress), abstract relationships (hidden causes, support), and figurative expressions of lag or deficit
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse with "beyond" (further than) or "beneath" (under); avoid using "behind" for vertical relationships (use "below" instead); incorrect: *"behind the table" when meaning "under the table"*
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: behind the scenes, behind schedule, behind bars, behind closed doors, behind the wheel
   - **Verb + prep**: fall behind, stay behind, leave behind, lag behind, hide behind, stand behind (support)
   - **Adjective + prep**: (no common adjective + behind patterns)
   - **Noun + prep**: reason behind, truth behind, story behind, person behind, force behind
   
   **Root Analysis**: be- (by, around) + hind (back, rear) — Old English *behindan*
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *behindan* (from *be-* "by" + *hindan* "from behind") → Middle English *bihinden* → Modern English "behind"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The car behind us keeps honking for some reason.
   - I'm so behind on my work right now—I'll be here all weekend catching up.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The research team investigated the mechanisms behind the observed phenomenon.
   - The committee stands behind the proposed policy changes and will advocate for their implementation.

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on prepositions that are essential for accurate expression
- Prioritize prepositions with learning value (multiple meanings, common errors, abstract uses)
- Clearly distinguish spatial, temporal, and abstract meanings
- Highlight dependent prepositions (collocations) as these are challenging for learners
