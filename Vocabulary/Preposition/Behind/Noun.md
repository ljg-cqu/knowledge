# Extract Nouns for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract nouns (concrete, abstract, technical terms, compound nouns) that are essential for language mastery from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one noun with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all nouns that are decision-critical for understanding the text
- Prioritize: technical terms, domain-specific vocabulary, abstract concepts, and nouns with cultural/contextual significance
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact and frequently-used nouns)
- Do not skip sections; cover both common and specialized terminology

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in nouns actually present in source
- Never invent nouns not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Technical and domain-specific terminology
- Abstract concepts requiring definition
- Compound nouns and noun phrases
- Nouns with multiple meanings or specialized usage
- Nouns that are challenging for language learners
