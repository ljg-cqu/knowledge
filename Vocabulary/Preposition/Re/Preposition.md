1. **Preposition**: re (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Concerning; regarding; in reference to a particular subject, document, or issue, especially in formal letters, emails, and legal/business writing
   
   **Synonyms**: regarding (formal), concerning (formal), in relation to, with respect to, about (neutral)
   
   **Antonyms**: unrelated to, separate from
   
   **When to Use**: Use `re` mainly in written English to introduce the subject of a letter, email, memo, or note (for example, in headings or short prepositional phrases like "re your application"). It is concise, somewhat formal, and common in legal, administrative, and business communication.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid `re` in very casual speech (prefer "about"), in continuous prose where full phrases like "regarding" or "concerning" are clearer, and do not confuse `re` with the prefix `re-` (as in "redo" or "rebuild"). Do not attach it directly to verbs (*"I re meeting"* is incorrect—use "re the meeting").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: re your email, re the meeting tomorrow, re the above matter, re our conversation yesterday
   - **Verb + prep**: write re, contact you re, follow up re, enquire re
   - **Adjective + prep**: unclear re, confused re (mostly BrE and formal; many writers prefer "unclear about" or "confused about")
   - **Noun + prep**: questions re, decision re, concerns re, information re, guidance re
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin preposition *re* (in the matter of, about) used directly in English as a borrowing
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin legal formulae *in re* (in the matter of) → adopted into English legal and business writing as `re` meaning "regarding/about" → widely used in headings and subject lines.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just a quick note re your trip next week—do you have your tickets?
   - Any thoughts re the party on Friday?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We are writing re your recent application for the position of Marketing Manager.
   - This memo sets out our recommendations re data retention and privacy compliance.

1. **Preposition**: Re: (type: compound header preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Used at the start of subject lines and headings to introduce the topic or reference of a letter, email, memo, or document (for example, `Re: Contract 2025/17 – Renewal Terms`)
   
   **Synonyms**: Subject: (for headings), regarding, concerning, in re (legal)
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (topic markers generally do not have direct opposites)
   
   **When to Use**: Use `Re:` in formal or semi-formal written communication (letters, email subject lines, memos) to label the matter being discussed, especially when referencing a file number, case, contract, invoice, or previous correspondence.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid treating `Re:` as a normal word inside sentences; it belongs in headings and subject lines. Do not confuse email client "Re:" (for replies) with your own manual `Re:` topic marker; modern systems often add `Re:` automatically to replies.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: Re: your recent order #45872, Re: Interview on 12 March, Re: Feedback on draft report
   - **Verb + prep**: reply Re: (auto-added by email client), forward Re: (rare; better to keep original subject)
   - **Noun + prep**: subject line Re:, memo Re: policy updates
   
   **Root Analysis**: Header form of Latin *re* (about) + colon indicating a label
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *in re* (in the matter of) → abbreviated as `Re:` in English correspondence headings → adopted by email systems as the automatic reply marker.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Subject: Re: dinner plans this weekend
   - Re: your text earlier—yes, I'm free on Saturday.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Re: Contract 2025/17 – Proposed Renewal Terms
   - Re: Complaint re billing errors on account 98321

1. **Preposition**: in re (type: phrasal, legal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* In the matter of; regarding; concerning a particular legal case or subject
   
   **Synonyms**: in the matter of, regarding, concerning, with respect to
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A
   
   **When to Use**: Primarily in legal writing, case names, and very formal documents (for example, *In re Smith* meaning "In the matter of Smith"). It signals the subject of a legal proceeding or formal decision.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use `in re` in everyday emails or general business writing—`re`, `regarding`, or `about` are more natural. Avoid mixing Latin and English forms awkwardly (*"in re the meeting"* is usually better as "re the meeting").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: in re Smith (a minor), in re the proposed merger, in re the application for leave
   - **Noun + prep**: order in re custody, judgment in re costs, opinion in re jurisdiction
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin *in* (in) + *re* (thing, matter)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin legal formula *in re* used in case names and headings → preserved in English legal style, especially in case law and formal court documents.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - *Rare in casual contexts; lawyers may joke with it, but learners should treat it as legal Latin.*
   - The file is labeled *In re Property Dispute*, which basically means "about the property dispute".
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In re the application for judicial review, the court grants leave on limited grounds.
   - The decision in re data protection obligations will affect future regulatory practice.
