1. **Functional Expression**: I'm writing re [topic] (function: informing / framing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A compact way to introduce the purpose of an email or letter by stating what it is about
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal (depending on [topic] and surrounding language)  
   - *Directness*: direct (clearly states the communicative purpose)
   
   **Synonyms**: I'm writing about [topic], I'm writing regarding [topic], This email is about [topic]
   
   **Antonyms**: (for function) ending formulas like "Best regards" rather than opening ones; indirect openings that hide the purpose
   
   **When to Use**: When you want a clear, concise opening in an email that anchors the reader to a specific subject (invoice, application, meeting, complaint) already mentioned in the subject line or previous correspondence.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very informal messages where a direct statement of purpose would feel stiff; when the purpose is obvious from context and repeating it wastes space.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I'm writing re your recent email about [topic].
   - I'm writing re invoice #[number].
   - I'm writing re our meeting on [date].
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: `re` condenses "regarding" and is common in business/legal writing; learners should recognise it as "about", not as the prefix `re-` of verbs.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Thank you for writing re [topic]."
   - "In response to your email re [topic], ..."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm writing re the trip next month—do you still want to join?
   - I'm writing re your message in the group chat.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - I am writing re your application for the position of Data Analyst.
   - I am writing re your complaint dated 2 May 2025.

1. **Functional Expression**: This email is re [topic] (function: topic-labeling / clarification)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Explicitly labels what the current email is about, often after greeting or in reply to a multi-thread conversation
   - *Formality*: neutral; slightly more spoken in feeling than "This correspondence concerns"  
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: This email is about [topic], This message concerns [topic], This note is regarding [topic]
   
   **Antonyms**: vague openers with no explicit topic ("Just a quick hello")
   
   **When to Use**: When threads have gone off-topic, when you are replying in a long chain, or when you need to reset focus on one matter among many.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Highly formal legal letters (prefer "This letter concerns"); ultra-casual texts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - This email is re your booking for [date].
   - This email is re the updated timeline.
   - This email is re the questions you raised yesterday.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Good for clarifying which part of a multi-topic exchange you are addressing; helps reduce confusion in long conversations.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Thanks for the email re [topic]."
   - "Your email re [topic] was very helpful."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a brief, low-pressure message about a specific topic; signals that the email should not take long to read
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral  
   - *Directness*: indirect-softened (minimises weight of the imposition)
   
   **Synonyms**: Just a quick note about [topic], Just a quick message re [topic], Just a quick reminder about [topic]
   
   **Antonyms**: heavy, formal openers like "We wish to inform you" or "This letter serves as formal notice"
   
   **When to Use**: For small updates, reminders, or clarifications re (about) one narrow issue with colleagues or friendly clients.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: High-stakes, negative, or legal topics; situations where the matter is anything but "quick".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just a quick note re tomorrow's meeting.
   - Just a quick note re your travel details.
   - Just a quick note re the draft you sent.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The word "just" softens the act and signals that you respect the reader's time; "quick note" frames the email as brief and manageable.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Thanks for the quick note re [topic]."
   - "Got your note re tomorrow—see you then."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - Politely checks on progress or a response about a specific matter without sounding aggressive
   - *Formality*: neutral; works in both internal and client-facing communication  
   - *Directness*: indirect-softened (acknowledges prior communication instead of issuing a bare request)
   
   **Synonyms**: Following up about [topic], Just following up on [topic], Circling back re [topic]
   
   **Antonyms**: Demanding forms like "You still haven't replied"; silent waiting with no follow-up
   
   **When to Use**: After a reasonable time has passed and you want to remind someone of an unanswered email, request, or decision.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the delay is very short or clearly explained; in highly formal legal contexts where exact dates and obligations should be spelled out.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Following up re last week's email.
   - Following up re the documents we requested.
   - Just following up re your availability.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Works well in subject lines ("Following up re..."), reducing face-threat compared to direct complaints.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Thanks for following up re [topic]; here is the update."
   - "Apologies for the delay re [topic]; see my answers below."
