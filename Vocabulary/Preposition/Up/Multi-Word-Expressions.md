# Extract Multi-Word Expressions for Vocabulary Learning: Up

**Task**: Extract multi-word expressions involving **"Up"** (collocations, idioms, phrases, fixed expressions) that are essential for fluent, native-like communication from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one multi-word expression with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, fixedness level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all multi-word expressions involving "up" that represent natural word partnerships or carry special meaning
- Prioritize: collocations, idiomatic expressions, fixed phrases, binomials, phrasal constructions, domain-specific multi-word terms
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and culturally significant expressions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both transparent collocations and opaque idioms

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in expressions actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- **Collocations (transparent meaning)**:
  - Verb + up (wake up, give up, set up, pick up, clean up)
  - Adjective + up (fed up, mixed up, backed up)
  - Adverb + up (straight up, right up)
  - Up + noun (up time, up vote, up front)
  - Verb + up + noun (make up one's mind, build up momentum)
- **Idioms & Fixed Phrases (non-literal meaning)**:
  - Idiomatic expressions with "up" (what's up?, up the ante, up to scratch)
  - Fixed phrases and binomials (ups and downs, up and running)
  - Conversational formulae (heads up, what's up, coming up)
  - Culturally-bound expressions (up the creek, up in arms)
