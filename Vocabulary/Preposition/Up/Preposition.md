- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and challenging prepositions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both literal and figurative uses

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in prepositions actually present in source
- Never invent prepositions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions
