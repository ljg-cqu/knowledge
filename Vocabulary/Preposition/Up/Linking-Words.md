1. **Linking Word**: up to (type: discourse marker/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates a limit, maximum, or extent; introduces the boundary or upper limit of something
   - *Function*: Marks limitation and extent; shows maximum amount, time, or degree
   
   **Synonyms**: as many as, as much as, until, as far as, to the extent of
   
   **Antonyms**: down to, from, starting from, at least
   
   **When to Use**: Describing limits, maxima, or extents; showing boundaries; appropriate across all registers for quantitative and temporal limits
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be ambiguous—"up to 100" might mean "as many as 100" or "approaching but not including 100"; clarify if needed
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject] + [verb] + up to [limit/maximum]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence before numerical or temporal limit
   - [Punctuation]: no comma unless in complex sentence structure
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusion about whether limit is inclusive or exclusive; "up to" usually includes the stated limit
   
   **Root Analysis**: up (to higher point/limit) + to (reaching toward)
   
   **Etymology**: Prepositional phrase indicating extent or limit → discourse function showing maximum or boundary
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We can invite up to twenty people.
   - I slept up to noon on Saturday!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The facility can accommodate up to 500 participants.

   **When to Use**: Emphasizing duration to a specific point; showing temporal limits; appropriate across registers but slightly more emphatic than "until" alone

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [event/state] + up until [time point]
   - [Position]: typically marks time boundary in narrative or description
   - [Punctuation]: comma if introductory temporal clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Redundancy with "up to" and "until" together; use one emphatic form
   
   **Root Analysis**: up (to limit) + until (time boundary)
   
   **Etymology**: Emphatic temporal phrase combining "up to" with "until" → reinforces continuation to boundary
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - [Punctuation]: follows natural sentence punctuation
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Redundant intensification; one "right" is sufficient
   
   **Root Analysis**: right (exactly, precisely) + up to (to limit)
   
   **Etymology**: Intensified form adding "right" for emphasis → "right" means "exactly, precisely"
