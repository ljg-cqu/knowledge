# Extract Functional Language for Vocabulary Learning: Up

**Task**: Extract functional language expressions and speech acts involving **"Up"** that are essential for pragmatic communication and social interaction from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one functional expression or speech act pattern with comprehensive learning information including pragmatic function, usage context, formality level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all functional expressions involving "up" that perform specific communicative actions
- Prioritize: requesting, suggesting, refusing, agreeing/disagreeing, expressing opinions, hedging, clarifying, turn-taking
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency social interactions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both direct and indirect speech acts

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in functional expressions actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard pragmatic descriptions

**Focus:**
- Requesting and asking (Can you look this up?, Would you mind picking this up?)
- Suggesting and recommending (Why don't we meet up?, How about catching up?)
- Agreeing and disagreeing (That adds up, That doesn't add up)
- Expressing opinions (It's up to you, I'm up for it)
- Refusing and declining (I can't make it up to you)
- Clarifying and checking understanding (To sum up..., Wrapping up...)
- Interrupting and turn-taking (Hold up, Wait up)
- Hedging and softening (It's coming up on..., It might come up...)

- **Common Variations**: Alternative forms with slight differences in tone or formality
- **Pragmatic Notes**: Cultural considerations, politeness strategies, face-saving aspects
