1. **Linking Word**: on top of that (type: connector/discourse marker  addition/emphasis)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Adds another point to what has just been said, often one that makes a situation even better or (more often) worse; roughly "in addition" or "what is more"
   - *Function*: discourse-level addition, often with emotional emphasis (especially for extra problems or complaints)
   
   **Synonyms**: in addition, besides, furthermore, whats more, moreover, to make matters worse
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, on the other hand, in contrast (introduce contrast rather than addition)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in spoken English, informal writing, narrative, and persuasive texts when you want to stack another argument, reason, or problem on top of an existing one. Very common when listing multiple negative factors: *The workload is heavy; on top of that, deadlines are tight.*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - In very formal academic writing, prefer "in addition" or "furthermore" instead of "on top of that".
   - Avoid overuse in a single paragraph; too many stacked clauses can sound repetitive or overly dramatic.
   - Do not confuse the discourse marker **on top of that** with purely spatial **on top of** (The box is on top of the shelf.).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause pattern (addition)**: 
   - [Statement 1]. **On top of that**, [statement 2].
   - [Statement 1], and **on top of that**, [statement 2].
   - **Position**: almost always sentence-initial or mid-sentence with commas; rarely sentence-final
   - **Punctuation**: capitalized at sentence start: *On top of that, ...*; followed by a comma in careful writing
   - **Common errors to avoid**: using without actually adding new information; using repeatedly where neutral connectors would be clearer
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (surface contact) + top (highest point) + of (linking to previous situation) + that (refers to the earlier statement or situation)
   
   **Etymology**: Literal "on top of" originally described physical position. The discourse marker developed metaphorically to express one issue being piled on top of another, especially in complaints or emphatic lists.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The bus was late, the Wi-Fi didnt work, and on top of that I spilled coffee on my shirt.
   - Im exhausted, and on top of that I still have three reports to finish tonight.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The sector is facing declining demand; on top of that, input costs have risen sharply in the last quarter.
   - The organization is undergoing major restructuring; on top of that, several senior leaders have announced their departure.
