   **Synonyms**: pile (up), heap (up), arrange in layers, pile up on top of, layer

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stack boxes on top of each other
   - neatly stacked on top of one another
   - stack chairs on top of the tables
   - documents stacked on top of the folder

1. **Verb**: pile (something) on top of (something)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (transitive) To put many things on top of one another in a heap, often less neatly than "stack"

   **Synonyms**: heap (up), load, dump, accumulate, add on
   
   **Antonyms**: remove, clear away, lighten, spread out
   
   **When to Use**: Use for both literal heaps (piling clothes on top of a chair) and metaphorical overload (piling more work on top of an already full schedule).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts that emphasize neatness or order ("stack" is better). In formal writing about allocation or assignment, use more neutral verbs like "assign" or "allocate."
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - pile dishes on top of the sink
   - pile one task on top of another

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - layer cheese on top of the sauce
   - layer one image on top of another
