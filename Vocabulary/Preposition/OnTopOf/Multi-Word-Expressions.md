1. **Expression**: on top of the world (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Feeling extremely happy, successful, or confident, as if you were standing at the highest point in the world
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the wording is very stable; the article "the" is normally kept)
   
   **Synonyms**: ecstatic, over the moon, elated, walking on air, feeling unbeatable
   
   **Antonyms**: depressed, down in the dumps, devastated, miserable, discouraged
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing intense positive emotion after success, good news, or a major personal milestone (promotion, exam results, recovery, achievement). Common in storytelling, conversation, and journalistic writing with a human-interest angle.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing, and in contexts of tragedy or serious loss where such enthusiasm would sound insensitive. Do not use it for mildly positive feelings; it implies very strong happiness.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - feel on top of the world
   - absolutely on top of the world
   - back on top of the world (after difficulties)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Standing at "the top of the world" metaphorically places you at the highest possible point, so the phrase naturally extends to describe peak happiness or success.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + top + of + the + world (world as the whole globe, symbol of everything)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - When I got the scholarship offer, I felt on top of the world.

1. **Expression**: on top of things (type: collocation/idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Well organized and fully in control of tasks, responsibilities, or information; managing a situation effectively
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the phrase is stable; the plural "things" is almost always used)
   
   **Synonyms**: organized, in control, on the ball, in command of the situation, fully up to date
   
   **Antonyms**: overwhelmed, behind, disorganized, out of control, drowning in work
   
   **When to Use**: Use to describe someone who manages workload, information, or responsibilities efficiently (e.g., email, projects, finances). Common in work, study, and life-admin contexts across spoken and written English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for one-off achievements where control is not the issue. For highly formal writing, consider more neutral phrases like "maintain effective control" or "remain fully informed".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - stay on top of things
   - keep on top of things
   - not really on top of things
   - feel on top of everything
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "On top" evokes a position above a pile, metaphorically suggesting that you are above and managing all the items below you. "Things" stands for tasks, issues, or details.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + top (highest level) + of + things (generic plural for tasks/issues)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I finally feel on top of things at work after cleaning up my inbox.
   - If you want less stress, you need to stay on top of things early in the week.

1. **Expression**: on top of that (type: fixed phrase/collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to add another point, often one that makes a situation better or worse; means "in addition (to what has just been mentioned), and what is more"
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the structure is stable; pronouns like "this" or "it all" can replace "that" in variations)
   
   **Synonyms**: in addition, besides, furthermore, whats more, to make matters worse/better
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, on the other hand, in contrast (linking contrast instead of addition)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in spoken English, informal writing, and narrative or persuasive texts when adding a new point that strengthens the previous argument or intensifies the situation (often negative: extra problems on top of existing ones).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal academic writing, prefer "in addition" or "furthermore". Avoid stacking too many clauses with "on top of that" in one paragraph; it can sound repetitive or overly dramatic.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - on top of this
   - on top of it all
   - and on top of that
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Literal "on top of" means physically added on a pile; the idiom extends this to additional reasons or problems stacked on an existing situation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + top + of + that (that = previous point/situation)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My laptop died, the train was late, and on top of that it started raining.
   - The rent went up, and on top of that, my hours at work were cut.

   **Synonyms**: win, triumph, prevail, emerge victorious, edge out the competition
   
   **Antonyms**: lose, fall behind, come in last, be defeated, end up at the bottom
   
   **When to Use**: Use in sports, business, exams, games, or any competitive or challenging context where someone eventually wins or achieves the best outcome.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in highly formal legal or technical writing where a more neutral verb like "prevail" or "be successful" is expected. Do not use when there is no notion of comparison or competition.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - come out on top of the competition
   - hope to come out on top
