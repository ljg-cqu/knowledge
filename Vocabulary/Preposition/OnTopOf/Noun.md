1. **Noun**: top (C, pl: tops)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (C) The highest part, point, or surface of something
   - (C) The most important or successful position in a group or ranking
   - (C) A lid, cover, or upper piece placed on something
   - *Grammatical info*: usually countable; often used in fixed phrases (at the top, on top)
   
   **Synonyms**: summit, peak, apex, highest point, upper surface
   
   **Antonyms**: bottom, base, foot, underside
   
   **When to Use**: Use when talking about the uppermost part of objects (the top of the mountain, the top of the page), the best position in rankings (at the top of the class), or a lid/cover (screw the top on). Core noun behind the preposition "on top of."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very technical descriptions where more precise terms like "summit," "apex," or "ceiling" are required. Avoid overusing "top" as a vague positive ("top person") where a more specific noun ("leader," "expert") clarifies meaning.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - on top of the hill
   - at the top of the page
   - top of the list
   - come out on top
   - top of the pile
   
   **Root Analysis**: top (native Germanic noun for highest part)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "topp" (tuft, crest, summit) → Modern English "top," extended from literal highest point to figurative best position.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Theres a cat sleeping on the top of the wardrobe.

   - The highest point of a hill or mountain
   - (figurative) The highest level of achievement or success in a particular activity
   - A formal meeting between leaders of governments or organizations
   
   **Synonyms**: peak, pinnacle, top, crest, apex
   
   **Antonyms**: base, bottom, valley, low point
   
   **When to Use**: Use "summit" when you want a slightly formal or literary alternative to "top," especially for mountains, achievements, or high-level political meetings (a climate summit). It fits naturally with the metaphor of being "on top of" a field or challenge.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual descriptions where "top" or "peak" is simpler. Avoid for small hills or everyday objects where "top" is sufficient.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - reach the summit
   - summit meeting
   - summit of ones career
   - at the summit of power
   
   **Root Analysis**: summit (borrowed from Romance languages)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French "somete" (summit, highest part) from Latin "summus" (highest), related to "sum." The connection to "top" is direct: the summit is literally the top of a mountain.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We finally made it to the summit just before sunset.
   - Winning that prize was the summit of his music career.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: summit, top, pinnacle, apex, height
   
   **Antonyms**: trough, low point, bottom, nadir
   
   **When to Use**: Use for physical high points (mountain peaks) and metaphorical high points (peak productivity, peak season). Strongly associated with the idea of being "on top of" a curve, market, or personal capacity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for flat or broad high areas where "plateau" is more accurate. Do not confuse with "peek" (look quickly) or "pique" (provoke interest or anger).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - reach a peak
   - at its peak
   - peak performance
   - peak demand
   - peak season
   
   **Root Analysis**: peak (possibly from Old Norse "pikr," point)

   **Antonyms**: core, center, base (for physical objects); simplicity, single level (for systems)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing stacked materials (a layer of icing on top of a cake, layers of clothing) or abstract structures with multiple levels (layers of bureaucracy). Naturally combines with "on top of" when explaining stacking or accumulation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the shape is not flat or sheet-like; terms like "chunk" or "block" may be better. Do not use "layer" where hierarchy rather than physical stacking is the focus; there "level" or "rank" can be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - a layer on top of another layer
   - multiple layers of meaning
   - peel back the layers
   - layer of dust
   - extra layer on top of
   
   **Root Analysis**: lay (to put something down) + -er (thing that is laid)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English "lecgan" (to lay) → "layer" as something laid; extended from physical layers to abstract ones in analysis and systems thinking.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Add another layer of cheese on top of the pasta.

   **When to Use**: Use when describing emotional, financial, or practical loads (a financial burden, the burden of care). Often occurs with "on top of" to highlight additional problems: *On top of everything else, this bill is a real burden.*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for neutral responsibilities that are not experienced as heavy or negative; "duty" or "role" may be more appropriate. Be careful with people-first language ("person with a disability" rather than "a burden").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - extra burden on top of
   - heavy burden
   - carry the burden
   - financial burden
   - shift the burden onto
   
   **Root Analysis**: burden (native noun meaning load)
