1. **Preposition**: on top of (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Positioned above and resting on the upper surface of something, often covering or pressing down on it
   - *(Spatial – stacking)* Arranged in a vertical pile, one thing directly above another
   - *(Abstract – addition)* In addition to something else; as an extra amount, responsibility, or problem
   - *(Abstract – control/knowledge)* Fully in control of, or up to date with, something (tasks, information, processes)
   
   **Synonyms**: [above (no physical contact, spatial)], [over (spatial coverage or movement)], [in addition to (extra amount/responsibility)], [besides (extra point, often informal)], [plus (extra, informal)]
   
   **Antonyms**: under, beneath, below (spatial); apart from (separate from), instead of (alternative, not additional)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on top of" when you want to emphasize vertical position with contact (a book on top of a box), piling or layering (snow on top of the roof), extra burdens or additions (deadlines on top of meetings), or strong control and awareness (stay on top of your inbox).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: 
   - Do not use "on top of" for general "inside" positions (use "in": *in the box*, not *on top of the box*).
   - Avoid it when no physical contact is implied and simple height is important ("above" or "over" is often better).
   - For neutral "in addition" in very formal writing, prefer "in addition to" or "besides".
   - Do not confuse clause-level **on top of that** (discourse marker meaning "in addition / what is more") with the spatial preposition.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: on top of the hill, on top of the box, on top of each other, on top of the existing rules, on top of the world, on top of that problem
   - **Verb + prep**: put/place/set/stack/pile [X] on top of [Y], sit/stand/lie on top of [something], come out on top of [the competition], stay/keep on top of [your work]
   - **Adjective + prep**: be on top of things, fully on top of the situation, hardly on top of the workload
   - **Noun + prep**: pressure on top of pressure, layers on top of layers, work on top of study, victory on top of victory
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (surface contact) + top (highest point or upper surface) + of (marks relationship to the following noun)
   
   **Etymology**: Developed in Middle English by combining the basic preposition "on" with the noun "top" and the preposition "of" to express the idea of one thing resting at the highest point of another. Over time it extended from literal vertical position to ideas of accumulation ("extra on top of") and control ("on top of things").

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Several new reporting requirements were introduced on top of the existing regulatory obligations.
