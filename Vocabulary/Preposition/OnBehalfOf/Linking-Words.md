   **Synonyms**: representing, for, in the name of, as a representative of
   
   **Antonyms**: against, in opposition to, contrary to
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on behalf of" to explicitly mark representative relationships in formal speeches, business correspondence, legal contexts, and official communications; signals that the speaker/actor is not acting for themselves
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for casual contexts where "for" suffices; don't overuse in consecutive sentences (becomes repetitive); avoid when causal meaning "because of" is intended
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Speaker/Actor] + [verb of communication/action] + on behalf of + [represented party]
   - **Position**: Usually follows the verb it modifies (end of clause) or at beginning of statement for emphasis
   - **Punctuation**: When fronted for emphasis, use comma: "On behalf of the committee, I welcome you."
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Don't confuse with "because of" (cause); avoid archaic "on the behalf of"
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (preposition) + behalf (interest, side) + of (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "be healfe" (by the side of) → Modern phrasal preposition signaling representation → grammaticalized as discourse marker introducing representative relationships
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - **Punctuation**: Generally no comma unless set off as nonessential modifier
