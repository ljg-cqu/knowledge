   **When to Use**: Use "on behalf of" in formal and professional contexts when representing others or expressing collective sentiments; essential for establishing representative relationships clearly; universally understood across English-speaking contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for casual conversation where "for" suffices; avoid archaic variant "on the behalf of"; don't use when meaning "because of" (common learner error)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - on someone's behalf
   - on behalf of all of us
   - act/speak/write on behalf of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "On behalf of" is the standard English formula for expressing representation since Middle English; "on" + "behalf" (meaning side/interest) + "of" creates prepositional phrase marking agency relationship; universally recognized in legal, business, and formal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (preposition) + behalf (from Old English "be healfe" = by the side of) + of (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - On behalf of everyone, thanks for coming to the party!

   **Common Variations**: 
   - authorized to act on behalf of
   - act on behalf of and in the interest of
   - legally act on behalf of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Act" naturally combines with "on behalf of" because the verb emphasizes agency (doing, performing) while "on behalf of" marks the representative relationship; this pairing is conventional in legal language for establishing scope of authority
   
   **Root Analysis**: act (perform actions) + on behalf of (representing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - speak on behalf of the group/organization
   - authorized to speak on behalf of
   - cannot speak on behalf of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Speak" naturally pairs with "on behalf of" because verbal communication is a primary function of representation; this collocation specifically marks spokesperson authority and is universally understood in formal contexts

   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound dramatic or archaic in casual contexts; avoid when simple representation without authority invocation is meant; be aware of negative connotations (historically used to justify atrocities)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in the name of the law
   - in the name of justice/freedom/progress
   - in someone's name
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Historical formula from legal and religious traditions where invoking someone's "name" meant invoking their authority or power; originated in contexts where names carried legal and spiritual power; fixed phrase grammaticalized as marker of authority invocation

   **Common Variations**: 
   - duly authorized representative
   - authorized representative of the company/organization
   - legal authorized representative
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Authorized" and "representative" form strong collocation because legal and business contexts require clarity about who has power to bind principals; "authorized" specifically addresses the authority question while "representative" identifies the role
   
   **Root Analysis**: authorized (given official power) + representative (person who represents)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Make sure you're dealing with an authorized representative, not a scammer.
   - Is he an authorized representative, or just a volunteer?

   - grant/give/hold power of attorney
   - durable power of attorney
   - limited/general power of attorney
   - medical/healthcare power of attorney

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Legal term of art dating to common law; "power" refers to authority granted, "attorney" means agent or representative (not lawyer), "of" marks relationship; historically referred to written document granting authority; now means both document and authority itself
   
   **Root Analysis**: power (authority) + of + attorney (agent, representative, from "attorney" meaning "one appointed to act for another")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My sister has power of attorney for our dad since he's getting older.
   - You'll need to set up a power of attorney before you travel abroad for an extended period.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - on my/your/his/her/their behalf
   - act/speak/intervene on someone's behalf
   - on our/everyone's behalf
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Grammatical variant of "on behalf of" using possessive pronoun instead of "of [person]"; same Middle English origin; identical meaning and usage; choice between forms is stylistic and depends on whether noun or pronoun reference
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + someone's (possessive pronoun) + behalf
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Thanks for calling on my behalf—I really appreciate it.

   - acting on behalf of the principal
   - when acting on behalf of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Acting" (present participle of "act") naturally combines with "on behalf of" to create participial phrase marking ongoing or habitual representative action; grammaticalized formula in agency law and business practice
   
   **Root Analysis**: acting (present participle: ongoing action) + on behalf of (representing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Acting on behalf of the team, I accepted the award.

   - authorized legal representative
   - legal representative and attorney-in-fact
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Legal" specifies the domain of representation (legal matters, legal authority) while "representative" identifies the role; strong collocation in legal contexts because it clarifies that representation has legal force and authority
   
   **Root Analysis**: legal (relating to law) + representative (person who represents)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Root Analysis**: for (preposition: benefit) + and (conjunction) + on behalf of (representing)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not appropriate for casual register—primarily legal usage]
