   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's been absent from class all week.

   **When to Use**: Use "without" to indicate absence or lack of something. Very common in all registers. Can indicate physical absence, missing qualities, or conditions.

   - **Verb + prep**: go without, do without, live without

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: minus the costs, minus a few details, minus one member
   - **Noun + prep**: total minus expenses, group minus John
   - **Mathematical use**: five minus three equals two
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin "minus" (less) = indicating subtraction or absence

   - The whole team is here minus Sarah.

   **Antonyms**: full of, replete with, containing, possessing
   
   **When to Use**: Use "devoid of" in formal contexts to emphasize complete absence of something, especially qualities or characteristics. Stronger than "without"—indicates total lack.

   - **Verb + prep**: be devoid of, remain devoid of, seem devoid of

   - **Verb + prep**: be lacking in, prove lacking in, seem lacking in
