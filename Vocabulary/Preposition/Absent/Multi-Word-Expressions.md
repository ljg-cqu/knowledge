1. **Expression**: conspicuous by one's absence (idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Noticeably absent when expected to be present; obviously missing
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiom)
   
   **Synonyms**: noticeably absent, obviously missing, glaringly absent, notably absent
   
   **Antonyms**: present and accounted for, in attendance, showing up
   
   **When to Use**: Use this idiom when someone's absence is so obvious it draws attention. Often implies the person should have been there. Works in both casual and semi-formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use for routine or expected absences. Avoid in very formal reports (use "notably absent"). Can sound sarcastic—use carefully.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - conspicuously absent
   - conspicuous in one's absence
   - notable by their absence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: From Latin phrase "conspicuus per absentiam." "Conspicuous" (highly visible) creates ironic contrast with "absence" (not visible). First popularized in English in 1859.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "conspicuus" (visible) + "absentia" (absence) = visible through absence
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The CEO was conspicuous by his absence at the company party.

   **Antonyms**: present for duty, on authorized leave, accounted for
   
   **When to Use**: Use "absent without leave" (AWOL) in military, legal, or formal workplace contexts for unauthorized absence. Very specific legal/military meaning. Often abbreviated to AWOL.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use casually for minor absences (too serious). Avoid in non-workplace contexts where legal implications aren't intended.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - AWOL (abbreviation)
   - gone AWOL
   - unauthorized absence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Military term established in U.S. armed forces. Distinguishes unauthorized absence from leave (authorized absence). Specific legal status with defined consequences.
   
   **Root Analysis**: absent (not present) + without (lacking) + leave (permission) = not present without permission
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Mike went AWOL from work for three days straight.
   - The whole team went AWOL after the project deadline.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - in the complete absence of
   - in the relative absence of
   - in one's absence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Formal construction emphasizing absence as determining factor. Common in academic and legal discourse where conditions must be precisely stated.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within/during) + the + absence (state of being away) + of (regarding)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In the absence of any instructions, we just winged it.
   - In the absence of coffee, tea will have to do.

   - *For idioms*: "Scarce" (rare, hard to find) metaphorically applied to person's presence. Originated mid-19th century as humorous expression for deliberate absence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: make (cause to be) + scarce (rare, not abundant) = cause oneself to be rare/absent

   - *For collocations*: Fixed negative construction emphasizing complete absence. "Nowhere" (not in any place) + passive infinitive "to be found" creates strong emphasis.
   
   **Root Analysis**: no + where (in no place) + to be found (able to be located) = not able to be located anywhere
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - they say absence makes the heart grow fonder
   - the old saying about absence
   - distance makes the heart grow fonder
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: English proverb, appears in poetry from 1602 (Francis Davison). Based on psychological observation that absence can increase appreciation. Fixed poetic structure.
   
   **Root Analysis**: Traditional proverb structure: absence (being away) → makes (causes) → heart (emotions) → grow fonder (increase in affection)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I miss you, but they say absence makes the heart grow fonder!
   - After a week apart, I realized absence really does make the heart grow fonder.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: disappear, vanish, become missing, get lost
   
   **Antonyms**: turn up, be found, appear, show up
   
   **When to Use**: Use when someone or something disappears or cannot be found. Common in news reports, police contexts, and everyday speech. More dramatic than "be missing."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use for planned absences where location is known. Avoid when "disappear" would be more direct. Less common in American English (prefer "go missing" in British English).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - gone missing
   - went missing
   - has gone missing
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Go" + "missing" is strongly preferred collocation in British English. "Go" emphasizes the transition from present to absent. More natural than "become missing."
   
   **Root Analysis**: go (move, change state) + missing (not able to be found) = change to state of being lost
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My cat went missing last Tuesday—have you seen her?
   - A lot of files have gone missing from the shared drive.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use for things that should be rare (like disasters). Avoid in very formal academic writing (use "rare" or "infrequent"). Can sound clichéd—use fresh alternatives sometimes.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - are few and far between
   - have been few and far between
   - becoming few and far between
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Poetic fixed expression. "Few" (small in number) + "far between" (widely spaced) creates emphatic imagery of scarcity through redundancy. Origins in 18th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: few (not many) + and + far (great distance) + between (in intervals) = not many with great distance between them
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Good jobs in this town are few and far between.
   - Opportunities like this are few and far between—don't miss it!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - absent-mindedly (adverb)
   - absent-mindedness (noun)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Compound adjective: "absent" (away) + "minded" (thinking). Mind is "absent" from present moment. First used mid-18th century to describe distracted scholars.
   
   **Root Analysis**: absent (away) + minded (having a mind focused on) = mind focused away from present
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He's so absent-minded he left his phone in the fridge.
   - Sorry, I'm a bit absent-minded today—didn't sleep well.

   - on leave of absence
   - request leave of absence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Formal legal phrase. "Leave" (permission to be absent) + "of absence" (specifying type of permission). Redundant but fixed in formal/legal usage.
   
   **Root Analysis**: leave (permission) + of + absence (being away) = permission to be away
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's taking a leave of absence to deal with family stuff.
   - He requested a leave of absence for medical reasons.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
