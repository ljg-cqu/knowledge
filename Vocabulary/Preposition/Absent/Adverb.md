1. **Adverb**: absently
   **Meaning**: 
   - (manner adverb, mid/end position) In a way that shows you are not paying attention to or thinking about what is happening around you; distractedly
   
   **Synonyms**: distractedly, inattentively, absentmindedly, vaguely, dreamily
   
   **Antonyms**: attentively, carefully, mindfully, consciously, alertly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "absently" to describe actions done without conscious attention or awareness. Common in narrative writing to show characters' distraction or preoccupation. Emphasizes mental absence rather than physical.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "absently" to mean "not present physically" (no adverb form exists for that meaning—restructure sentence). Avoid when "carelessly" implies negligence rather than distraction.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stare absently
   - nod absently
   - smile absently
   - fidget absently
   - reply absently
   
   **Root Analysis**: absent (away) + -ly (manner) = in an away/distracted manner
   
   **Etymology**: From "absent" (Latin "absentem") + "-ly" adverb suffix, specifically referring to mental rather than physical absence
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She absently stirred her coffee while staring out the window.
   - He absently nodded along, clearly not listening.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

2. **Adverb**: away
   **Meaning**: 
   - (manner/place adverb, end position) To or at a distance from a particular place, person, or thing
   - *(Sense 2)* (degree, intensifying) Continuously, persistently (often with action verbs)
   
   **Synonyms**: elsewhere, off, aside, gone, forth
   
   **Antonyms**: here, near, close, toward, present
   
   **When to Use**: Use "away" to indicate movement or position at a distance, or continuous action. Very common in both casual and formal contexts. Can intensify verbs (work away, type away).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse with adjective "away" (predicative only). Avoid redundancy with verbs that inherently mean departure (don't say "depart away").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - go away
   - run away
   - stay away from
   - far away
   - right away
   - work away
   - fade away
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on) + way (path) = on the path elsewhere
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "aweg/onweg" (on way) → indicating movement or position at a distance
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Put those toys away before someone trips on them!
   - He lives pretty far away now.

   **Antonyms**: here, in this place, locally
   
   **When to Use**: Use "elsewhere" for more formal or precise indication of location other than the one being discussed. Common in academic, formal writing, and directions. More specific than "away."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "elsewhere" when "somewhere else" would sound more natural in casual speech. Avoid in questions (use "somewhere else").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - look elsewhere
   - elsewhere in the document
   - focus lies elsewhere
   - seek employment elsewhere
   - discussed elsewhere
   
   **Root Analysis**: else (other) + where (at what place) = at another place
   
   **Etymology**: "Else" (Old English "elles" = otherwise) + "where" → compound adverb indicating other location
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you don't like it here, go elsewhere!
   - I think I left my phone elsewhere in the house.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: locally, nearby, directly, in person, closely
   
   **When to Use**: Use "remotely" for actions done from a distance, especially via technology. Sense 2 (with negatives) emphasizes complete absence of a quality. Very common in modern workplace contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "remotely" alone to mean "slightly" in positive statements (requires negative context). Avoid confusion with "distantly" in emotional contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - work remotely
   - accessed remotely
   - not remotely interested
   - not remotely possible
   - remotely controlled
   
   **Root Analysis**: remote (distant) + -ly (manner) = in a distant manner

   **When to Use**: Use "separately" when describing actions or entities maintained apart or treated independently. Common in instructions, billing, academic analysis, and organizational contexts.
