   **When to Use**: Use "absent" to describe someone or something not present where expected. Common in formal contexts (attendance records, academic writing), or to describe missing qualities or characteristics.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "absent" as a verb in formal writing (use "absent oneself" instead). Avoid "absent" when "missing" would be more natural in casual speech.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - absent from school/work
   - absent without leave (AWOL)
   - conspicuously absent
   - notably absent
   - absent-minded
   
   **Root Analysis**: ab- (away from) + -sent (being, from Latin "esse" = to be) = being away from
