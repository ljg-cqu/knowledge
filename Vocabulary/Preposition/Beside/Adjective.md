1. **Adjective**: adjacent (comp: more adjacent, sup: most adjacent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (of a building, room, area, etc.) next to or adjoining something else; sharing a common boundary
   - *(Technical/Mathematical)* (of two angles) having a common vertex and a common side
   
   **Synonyms**: adjoining, neighboring, next-door, contiguous, bordering
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, remote, separate, detached, isolated
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjacent" in formal, technical, or professional contexts when describing proximity with shared boundaries; in real estate, architecture, urban planning, and mathematics
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "next to" or "next-door" is more natural; not appropriate for describing distant proximity; overly formal for everyday speech
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - adjacent property/building/room
   - adjacent areas/regions
   - immediately adjacent, directly adjacent
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to, toward) + jacent (from jacēre = to lie) → "lying near to"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "adjacēre" (to lie near) → Old French "adjacent" → English (15th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The gym is in the adjacent building—just next door.
   - We booked adjacent rooms so we'd be close to each other.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposed development occupies land adjacent to the existing commercial district.
   - Data from adjacent monitoring stations corroborate these findings.

2. **Adjective**: neighboring (comp: more neighboring, sup: most neighboring)
   **Meaning**:

   - belonging to or associated with a nearby area or community
   
   **Synonyms**: nearby, adjoining, adjacent, next-door, surrounding
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, remote, far-off, faraway
   
   **When to Use**: Use "neighboring" for describing proximity in general terms; appropriate for geographic, social, and spatial contexts; common in both formal and informal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise adjacency with shared boundaries is meant (use "adjacent" instead); less appropriate for technical or architectural contexts
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - neighboring countries/states/cities
   - neighboring house/building
   - neighboring communities, neighboring areas
   
   **Root Analysis**: neighbor (from neah = near + gebur = dweller) + -ing (participial adjective suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "nēahgebūr" (near-dweller) → "neighbor" → "neighboring" (adjective form)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We often have barbecues with the neighboring families.
   - The noise from the neighboring apartment kept me up all night.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: close, near, close by, at hand, in proximity
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, far, remote, faraway, far-off
   
   **When to Use**: Use "nearby" for general proximity without specifying exact distance; appropriate in all registers; can function as both adjective and adverb
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise adjacency or immediate contact is meant; less formal than "proximate" or "adjacent" in technical contexts
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - nearby town/city/village
   - nearby location, nearby area
   - nearby stores/shops/restaurants
   
   **Root Analysis**: near (close in distance) + by (at hand) → "close at hand"
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "nere" + "by" → compound adjective indicating proximity
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's grab lunch at that nearby café.
   - Is there a nearby gas station? I'm almost out of fuel.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

4. **Adjective**: proximate (comp: more proximate, sup: most proximate)

   **Synonyms**: close, near, immediate, adjacent, direct
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, remote, far, indirect, unrelated
   
   **When to Use**: Use "proximate" in formal, academic, legal, or technical writing; when discussing causation or direct relationship; in philosophical or scientific contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for everyday conversation; avoid in casual contexts where "close" or "nearby" would be more natural; can sound pompous in informal settings
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - proximate cause (legal term)
   - proximate location/area
   - in proximate distance, proximate relationship
   
   **Root Analysis**: proxim- (nearest, from prope = near) + -ate (adjective suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "proximatus" (brought near) → "proximate" (mid-16th century) indicating nearness in space, time, or causation
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rare in casual use) The two houses are proximate to each other.
   - (More natural) The two houses are right next to each other.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The investigation identified the proximate cause of the system failure.

   **Synonyms**: adjacent, adjoining, bordering, touching, abutting
   
   **Antonyms**: separate, detached, disconnected, isolated, non-adjacent
   
   **When to Use**: Use "contiguous" in formal, technical, or geographic contexts; when emphasizing shared boundaries or continuous connection; in real estate, geography, and data analysis
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation; avoid when simple "next to" or "touching" would be clearer; not appropriate for non-physical proximity
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - contiguous territory/land/property
   - contiguous states (e.g., "the contiguous United States")
   - contiguous areas/regions, contiguous data
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together, with) + tig- (from tangere = to touch) + -uous (adjective suffix)

   **When to Use**: Use "juxtaposed" when emphasizing deliberate placement for comparison or contrast; common in art, literary, and academic analysis; appropriate in formal writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overly formal for everyday conversation; implies intentional placement rather than coincidental proximity; not suitable for simple physical adjacency without comparative purpose
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - juxtaposed images/elements/concepts
   - starkly juxtaposed, carefully juxtaposed
   - juxtaposed against/with something
   
   **Root Analysis**: juxta- (beside, near) + pose (to place) + -ed (past participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "juxta" (beside, near) + French "poser" (to place) → "juxtapose" (19th century) → "juxtaposed"

   **When to Use**: Use "parallel" in geometric, technical contexts; when describing similar developments or analogous situations; in formal analysis and comparison

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - parallel lines/planes/surfaces
   - parallel development/evolution
   - run parallel to, parallel structure
   
   **Root Analysis**: para- (beside, alongside) + allel (from allelon = one another)
