1. **Adverb**: approximately (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to show that something is almost but not completely accurate or exact; roughly or about
   - Close to a particular number, time, or amount, but not exact
   
   **Synonyms**: roughly, about, around, nearly, close to
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, specifically, definitely
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts when indicating estimated values, dates, or quantities; appropriate in academic, professional, and technical writing; can be used interchangeably with "circa" for dates but is more versatile for other contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact figures are known and should be stated; can sound overly formal in casual conversation (use "about" or "around" instead); don't combine redundantly with "circa" (not "approximately circa")
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - approximately [number] people
   - dated approximately to [year]
   - approximately the same time
   - cost approximately [amount]

   **Root Analysis**: ap- (to, toward) + proxim- (nearest) + -ate + -ly (adverb suffix)
