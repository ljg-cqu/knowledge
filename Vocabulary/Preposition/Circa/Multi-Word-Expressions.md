1. **Expression**: circa [year] (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A fixed prepositional phrase meaning "around [year]" or "approximately [year]"; used to indicate an estimated or approximate date
   - *Fixedness*: strong (word order is fixed; "circa" must precede the date)
   
   **Synonyms**: around [year], about [year], approximately [year], c. [year], ca. [year]
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly [year], precisely [year], in [year] (when exact)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in academic, scholarly, historical, museum, and formal written contexts when providing approximate dates; particularly appropriate for historical events, artifacts, artworks, manuscripts, and archaeological findings; preferred in art history, classical studies, and historical documentation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (use "around" or "about" instead); inappropriate for future dates (use "around" for future); don't use for contemporary events with known dates; avoid redundancy like "circa approximately" or "approximately circa"
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - c. [year] (abbreviated form)
   - ca. [year] (alternate abbreviation)
   - circa [year] CE/BCE/AD/BC (with era designation)
   - circa [year range] (e.g., circa 1450-1480)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: "Circa" is borrowed directly from Latin as a technical term for approximate dating; it has become the standard scholarly convention for indicating temporal approximation in academic and museum contexts; the word-order is fixed because it maintains the Latin prepositional structure
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "circa" (around, about) + numerical date
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That building's from circa 1850 or something.
   - The photo was taken circa 1920, I think.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Leonardo da Vinci was born circa 1452 in Vinci, Republic of Florence.
   - The manuscript has been dated to circa 1320 CE through paleographic analysis.

1. **Expression**: dated to circa [year] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A verb phrase collocation meaning "assigned an approximate date of [year]"; used when the dating of an object has been established through analysis
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common pattern but variations exist)
   
   **Synonyms**: dated to approximately [year], dated to around [year], attributed to circa [year], placed at circa [year]
   
   **Antonyms**: precisely dated to [year], confirmed as [year]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in academic, archaeological, museum, and scholarly contexts when reporting dating analysis results; appropriate when describing scientific dating methods, stylistic analysis, or expert attribution; indicates the result of analytical work
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when dates are known with certainty; inappropriate for modern objects with manufacturing dates; don't use when the dating is pure speculation without evidence
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - has been dated to circa [year]
   - is dated to circa [year]
   - can be dated to circa [year]
   - tentatively dated to circa [year]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The verb "date" (meaning "assign a date to") naturally combines with "circa" because dating archaeological and historical objects typically yields approximate rather than exact results; this partnership reflects the reality of historical research where precision is often unattainable
   
   **Root Analysis**: "dated" (Latin "data" = given) + "to" + "circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The artifact is dated to circa 500 BC.
   - They dated it to circa 1850.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The pottery has been dated to circa 2000 BCE through thermoluminescence analysis.
   - Radiocarbon dating places the settlement at circa 1200-1000 BCE.

1. **Expression**: flourished circa [year] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An idiomatic phrase meaning "was at the peak of productivity or influence around [year]"; used in biographical and historical writing to indicate the active period of a person
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed historical/biographical formula)
   
   **Synonyms**: was active circa [year], worked during circa [year], fl. circa [year] (abbreviation)
   
   **Antonyms**: died in [year], born in [year] (when exact)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in biographical entries, historical texts, art historical writing, and academic contexts when the exact life dates of a person are unknown but their period of activity can be estimated; particularly common for ancient, medieval, and Renaissance figures
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact birth and death dates are known (state those instead); inappropriate for contemporary figures; don't use for institutions or places (they "were established" or "existed")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - fl. circa [year] (abbreviation: "floruit")
   - flourished during the period circa [year range]
   - was active circa [year]
   - worked circa [year]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Flourish" (from Latin "florere" = to flower) has become the standard term in biographical writing for indicating a person's active period; it pairs with "circa" because exact dates of peak activity are usually estimates; this formula dates back to scholarly conventions in classical and medieval studies
   
   **Root Analysis**: "flourished" (Latin "florere" = to flower) + "circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This artist flourished circa 1600 during the Renaissance.
   - The philosopher flourished circa 500 BC.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Heraclitus of Ephesus flourished circa 500 BCE and is known for his doctrine of change.
   - The anonymous sculptor flourished circa 1480-1510 in Florence.

1. **Expression**: estimated at circa [number] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A verb phrase collocation meaning "calculated or judged to be approximately [number]"; used when providing estimated quantities, populations, or values
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred pattern but variations exist)
   
   **Synonyms**: estimated at approximately [number], estimated at around [number], calculated at circa [number], assessed at circa [number]
   
   **Antonyms**: measured at exactly [number], confirmed as [number], precisely [number]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in academic, demographic, economic, and scientific contexts when providing calculated estimates of populations, costs, quantities, or measurements; appropriate when exact figures are unavailable
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact measurements exist; inappropriate when implying verified data; don't use for contemporary statistics with precise counts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - is estimated at circa [number]
   - was estimated at circa [number]
   - can be estimated at circa [number]
   - estimated to be circa [number]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Estimate" inherently implies approximation, making it a natural partner with "circa"; this combination reinforces the approximate nature of the figure and is conventional in demographic and historical studies
   
   **Root Analysis**: "estimated" (Latin "aestimare" = to value) + "at circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The crowd was estimated at circa 10,000 people.
   - The cost is estimated at circa $5 million.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The population of Rome during the 2nd century CE is estimated at circa 1 million inhabitants.

1. **Expression**: dating from circa [year] (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A verb phrase meaning "originating from approximately [year]"; used to describe when something was created or came into existence
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed pattern in historical and archaeological description)
   
   **Synonyms**: dating to circa [year], originating from circa [year], from circa [year], originating circa [year]
   
   **Antonyms**: dating from exactly [year], created in [year] (when precise)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in descriptive contexts for artifacts, buildings, documents, or artworks when providing estimated creation dates; appropriate in museum labels, catalogue entries, and historical descriptions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact creation dates are known; inappropriate for modern objects with manufacturing dates
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - dating from circa [year range]
   - dating to circa [year]
   - an artifact dating from circa [year]
   - manuscripts dating from circa [year]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Dating from" is the standard formula for describing temporal origins; it pairs naturally with "circa" because the origins of historical objects are typically approximate; this is standard museum and catalogue language
   
   **Root Analysis**: "dating" (Latin "data" = given) + "from circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's an old coin dating from circa 300 BC.
   - The church is dating from circa 1200.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed pattern in architectural and historical description)
   
   **Synonyms**: built circa [year], erected circa [year], established circa [year], founded circa [year]
   
   **Antonyms**: constructed in [year] (when exact), precisely built in [year]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in architectural history, historical descriptions, and scholarly contexts when describing building construction dates; appropriate when exact construction dates are unknown
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact construction dates are documented; inappropriate for modern buildings with known completion dates
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - was constructed circa [year]
   - constructed circa [year range]
   - built circa [year]
   - erected circa [year]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Construction dates for historical buildings are often estimated from architectural style, documentary evidence, or archaeological analysis; "circa" is the standard term for indicating this approximation in architectural history
   
   **Root Analysis**: "constructed" (Latin "construere" = to pile up, build) + "circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The castle was constructed circa 1200.
   - That bridge was built circa 1850.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The cathedral was constructed circa 1220-1260 in the Gothic style.

   **Antonyms**: born in [year] (when exact), born on [specific date]
   
   **When to Use**: Use in biographical writing, encyclopedic entries, and historical texts when exact birth dates are unknown but can be estimated; particularly common for historical figures before modern record-keeping
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact birth dates are documented; inappropriate for recent historical figures with known dates
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - b. circa [year] (abbreviation)
   - born circa [year range]
   - birth circa [year]
   - lived circa [year range]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Biographical conventions require indicating birth dates when known; "circa" allows scholars to provide estimated birth years when exact dates are unavailable, which is common for pre-modern figures; this is standard practice in biographical reference works
   
   **Root Analysis**: "born" (Old English "boren") + "circa" (Latin = around)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Shakespeare was born circa 1564 in Stratford.
   - The artist was born circa 1480.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
