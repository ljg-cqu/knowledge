1. **Preposition**: circa (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Used before a date or number to indicate that it is approximate or estimated; around, approximately, about
   - *(Numerical)* Used to indicate an approximate quantity, measurement, or value
   
   **Synonyms**: about (in time contexts), around (in time contexts), approximately (formal contexts), roughly (informal contexts), c. (written abbreviation)
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, definitely, specifically
   
   **When to Use**: Use "circa" when providing approximate dates in historical, academic, or formal contexts; when discussing estimated quantities or measurements where precision is not required or not known; particularly common in art history, archaeology, historical documentation, and scholarly writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (use "around" or "about" instead); do not use when exact dates or numbers are known and precision is important; inappropriate in legal documents requiring specific dates; not used with future dates (use "around" instead); avoid redundancy like "circa approximately" or "circa about"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: circa 1850, circa 500 BCE, circa $10 million, circa 2000 years ago
   - **Noun + circa + date**: born circa 1456, painted circa 1503, established circa 1920
   - **With measurements**: circa 100 meters, circa 5 kilograms, circa 30 degrees
   - **Historical periods**: the Roman Empire circa 117 AD, Greece circa 400 BC
   
   **Root Analysis**: circa (complete Latin word, not decomposable in English)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → circa (around, about, near) → directly borrowed into English in 19th century for scholarly use, particularly in dating historical artifacts and documents; originally a Latin preposition and adverb meaning "around" or "on all sides"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That painting's from circa 1890 or something like that.
   - The population was circa 50,000 back then, I think.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Preposition**: c. (type: simple - abbreviation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* Abbreviated form of "circa"; used before dates to indicate approximation
   - *(Formal written)* Exclusively used in written academic and historical texts
   
   **Synonyms**: circa, ca. (alternate abbreviation), approximately, about
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal written texts, academic citations, museum labels, historical documentation, and scholarly publications when space is limited or brevity is preferred; particularly common in footnotes, bibliographies, and catalogue entries
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use in spoken language (say "circa" or "about"); avoid in casual writing; not appropriate when the full word would improve clarity; never use in legal documents requiring precision
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: c. 1500, c. 50 BC, c. $500
   - **Museum labels**: Artist Unknown (c. 1600)
   - **Bibliographic citations**: Published c. 1925
   - **Historical dates**: Died c. 44 BCE
   
   **Root Analysis**: c. = abbreviation of "circa" (Latin: around)
   
   **Etymology**: Abbreviated form of Latin "circa" → adopted in English scholarly writing as a space-saving convention; "ca." is an alternative abbreviation sometimes used
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Not typically used in casual speech or writing
   - When speaking, say "around 1800" rather than "c. 1800"
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1452–1519) was a polymath of the Italian Renaissance.
   - The artifact is dated to c. 3000 BCE based on radiocarbon analysis.
