1. **Linking Word**: while (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the time that; at the same time as
   - *Function*: Indicates temporal simultaneity or contrast between two events or states
   
   **Synonyms**: whilst, whereas, although, as
   
   **Antonyms**: before, after, until
   
   **When to Use**: Use when indicating that two events occur simultaneously or when contrasting two situations; appropriate in academic and historical writing; frequently used with "circa" dates to establish temporal context
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when events are sequential rather than simultaneous; don't overuse in single paragraphs (vary with other temporal conjunctions)
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Event A], while [Event B circa year]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence (subordinate clause follows main clause)
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "while" when contrasting; no comma when temporal
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing temporal "while" with contrastive "while"
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (from Old English "hwil" = period of time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → hwil (time, while) → Middle English "while" (conjunction use developed)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The building was renovated, while the original structure dates from circa 1850.

   **Antonyms**: because, since, as (causal conjunctions)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when acknowledging a fact that contrasts with or seems to contradict the main clause; appropriate in academic writing; commonly used with "circa" dates to acknowledge dating uncertainties while making assertions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when there's no contrast or contradiction; don't use for causal relationships
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Although [concessive fact circa year], [main assertion]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma after "although" clause when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using "but" after "although" (redundant)
   
   **Root Analysis**: al- (all) + though (from Old English "þeah" = though)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → "al" (all) + "though" → compound conjunction (13th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when making unsupported claims; inappropriate when evidence is weak or non-existent
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Conclusion/date circa year], based on [evidence]
   - [Position]: sentence-final or sentence-initial
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "based on" when sentence-final; comma after when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: overusing in consecutive sentences; not specifying what the basis is
   
   **Root Analysis**: base (from Greek "basis" = foundation) + -ed + on
   
   **Etymology**: Greek → basis (foundation) → Latin "basis" → "base" + "-ed on" → phrasal connector
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement 1 circa year]. However, [contrasting statement]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), mid-sentence, sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: semicolon or period before; comma after when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using comma splice before "however"
   
   **Root Analysis**: how + ever (in whatever way)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → "how" + "ever" → compound adverb (14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The date is circa 1850. However, it could be earlier.
   - It's valuable, circa $10,000. However, that's just an estimate.

   - [Clause structure]: [Evidence], suggesting [date circa year]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence or sentence-final (participial phrase)
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "suggesting" when participial phrase
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using without clear antecedent; implying certainty when meaning approximation
   
   **Root Analysis**: sug- (from Latin "sub" under) + -gest (carry) + -ing
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → suggerere (to carry under, supply, suggest) → "suggest" + "-ing" → present participle/gerund
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
