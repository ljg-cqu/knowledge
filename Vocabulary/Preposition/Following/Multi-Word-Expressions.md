   - over the following days/weeks
   - throughout the following days/weeks
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Following" naturally combines with time period nouns to create forward-looking temporal frames; the semantic compatibility between "following" (temporal succession) and time units creates natural partnership

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Medieval origin when travelers literally followed footprints in snow/mud for safe passage; metaphorically extended to mean following someone's example or life path; the physical tracking metaphor naturally extends to abstract guidance-following

   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation, "next day" often sounds more natural; can be ambiguous if reference point unclear; ensure readers know which day/time is being "followed"
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - early/late the following morning
   - on the following day
   - by the following week
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - followed suit
   - following suit with [specific action]
   - quickly/immediately following suit
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Originates from card games where players must "follow suit" by playing a card of the same suit as the first card played; extended metaphorically to any situation where someone copies another's action; first recorded use: early 1800s
   
   **Root Analysis**: following (gerund of follow) + suit (from French "suite", sequence/series; in cards, set of same symbol)

   - failed to follow through
   
   **Why This Partnership**:
