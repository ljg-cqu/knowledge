1. **Preposition**: following (type: simple/complex)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* After in time; coming after a particular time or event
   - *(Causal)* As a result of; because of; in consequence of
   - *(Sequential)* Coming after in order or sequence; next after
   
   **Synonyms**: after (in temporal contexts), subsequent to, because of (in causal contexts), as a result of
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, preceding, ahead of
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal writing to indicate temporal succession or causal relationship; more formal than "after"; common in business, academic, legal writing; can indicate both time sequence and causation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation (use "after" instead); can be ambiguous between temporal and causal meanings; ensure context clarifies intended meaning; avoid overuse
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: following + noun/gerund ("following the meeting", "following completion")
   - **Verb + prep**: occurs/happens following, implemented following, revised following
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not applicable—following functions as preposition here)
   - **Noun + prep**: changes following, events following, developments following
   
   **Root Analysis**: follow (verb: to come after) + -ing (present participle functioning as preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "folgian" (to follow) + -ing → grammaticalized from present participle to preposition in Middle English, particularly in formal registers
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After the game, let's grab dinner.
   - Because of the weather, they cancelled the event.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Preposition**: after (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* During the period of time following an event or another period; later than
   - *(Spatial)* Behind in position; following in sequence
   - *(Sequential)* Next to and following in order or importance
   
   **Synonyms**: following, subsequent to, later than, behind
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, ahead of, preceding
   
   **When to Use**: Use across all registers (casual to formal) to indicate temporal, spatial, or sequential relationships; most common and versatile temporal preposition; essential for everyday time expressions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Context must clarify which meaning (temporal vs. spatial vs. sequential); can create ambiguity when multiple interpretations possible
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: after + noun ("after dinner"), after + time expression ("after 5pm")
   - **Verb + prep**: came/occurred/happened after, scheduled after, placed after
   - **Adjective + prep**: hungry after, tired after, ready after
   - **Noun + prep**: time after, period after, days/weeks after
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "æfter" (behind in place, later in time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "æfter" (behind, following, later) → related to Germanic roots indicating "farther back" → developed temporal meaning from spatial
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's meet after work.
   - I'll call you after I finish this.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - After careful consideration, the committee approved the proposal.

   **Antonyms**: prior to, before, preceding, earlier than
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal, academic, legal, or technical writing to indicate temporal sequence; more formal than "after" or "following"; common in contracts, research papers, official documents
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for everyday conversation or casual writing; sounds stilted in informal contexts; when "after" or "following" work equally well, prefer the simpler option
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: subsequent to + noun/gerund ("subsequent to the review", "subsequent to signing")
   - **Verb + prep**: occurred subsequent to, implemented subsequent to, revised subsequent to
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not common)
   - **Noun + prep**: changes subsequent to, events subsequent to, period subsequent to
   
   **Root Analysis**: sub- (after, under) + sequ (follow) + -ent (adjective) + to (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "subsequens" (following after) + English "to" → developed as formal prepositional phrase in legal and academic English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After we signed the contract, everything moved quickly.
   - Once the meeting ended, we got started right away.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, leading up to, in anticipation of
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing events or actions following significant, often disruptive, events; common in journalism, formal analysis; implies both temporal succession and causal impact; often used for negative events
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too dramatic for minor or routine events; implies significant impact; avoid for positive events where simpler "after" or "following" more appropriate; can sound clichéd if overused
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: in the wake of + noun ("in the wake of the crisis")
   - **Verb + prep**: occurred/happened in the wake of, changed in the wake of
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not applicable)
   - **Noun + prep**: changes/events/developments in the wake of
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition) + the (article) + wake (track left in water) + of (preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Nautical metaphor: "wake" (track left by ship in water) → anything in wake is following and affected by ship → metaphorically extended to consequences following significant events

   **Synonyms**: following, after, when, as soon as, immediately after
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, until
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing to show immediate temporal succession or trigger events; "upon" more formal than "on"; common with gerunds ("upon receiving", "on completing"); creates tight logical-temporal connection
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Upon" is very formal, sometimes archaic; "on" less formal but still not casual; in everyday contexts, use "when" or "after"; can sound stilted in casual writing
   
   **Common Patterns**:

   - **Verb + prep**: acted upon, decided on, based upon
   - **Adjective + prep**: dependent upon, contingent on, reliant on
   - **Noun + prep**: decision upon, action upon, effect on
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "on" (in, on, at); "upon" = "up" + "on"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "on" → combined with "up" to form "upon" (more emphatic/formal variant) in Middle English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - When I got there, I called her.

   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition) + the (article) + aftermath (consequences following event) + of (preposition)
