   **Synonyms**: after, subsequent to, as a result of, in the wake of, because of
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, preceding, ahead of
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal writing to show temporal sequence or causal relationship; creates sophisticated sentence structure; common in academic, business, professional writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation; can sound stiff in informal writing; when simple "after" works better, prefer it; avoid overuse
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Following + noun/gerund, [main clause]
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial (most common), occasionally mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory following phrase: "Following the meeting, we..."
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse with verb "following" (pursuing); ensure clear referent for what is being followed
   
   **Root Analysis**: follow (verb: to come after) + -ing (gerund/present participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "folgian" (to follow, go with) + -ing → developed prepositional function in Middle English
