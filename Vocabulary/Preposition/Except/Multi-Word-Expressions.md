1. **Expression**: with the exception of (type: phrasal preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Apart from; excluding; not including; except for (transparent collocation)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed prepositional phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: except for, apart from, aside from, excluding, save for
   
   **Antonyms**: including, along with, together with
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and informal contexts; emphasizes exception more explicitly than simple "except"; can appear sentence-initially or mid-sentence; common in written English
   
   **When NOT to Use**: More formal than "except" or "except for"; can sound verbose in casual conversation; simple "except" often suffices
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - with few exceptions
   - with certain exceptions
   - with rare exceptions
   - with one exception
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "With the exception of" is a fixed formal phrase providing explicit framework for stating exceptions; more emphatic than simple "except"; derived from legal and formal writing conventions
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (accompaniment) + the exception (excluded case) + of (belonging to)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone's coming with the exception of Tom.
   - I like all vegetables, with the exception of brussels sprouts.

1. **Expression**: make an exception (type: verb collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To allow something that is normally not allowed; to exempt someone or something from a usual rule or practice (transparent collocation)
   - *Fixedness*: strong (verb "make" strongly collocates with "exception" for this meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: allow an exception, grant an exemption, bend the rules, make allowances
   
   **Antonyms**: enforce the rule, apply strictly, make no exceptions
   
   **When to Use**: Common in requests and negotiations; formal and informal contexts; implies authority to grant deviation from standard; often in questions ("Can you make an exception?")
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not when describing passive observation of exceptions; requires agency to grant exception; don't use "do an exception" or "give an exception"
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - make a rare exception
   - make a special exception
   - make one exception
   - make exceptions for
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: English uses "make" (not "do" or "give") with "exception" for granting deviations from rules; conventional verb-noun partnership; "make" suggests creating space for deviation
   
   **Root Analysis**: make (create/cause) + an exception (case not following rule)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you make an exception just this once?
   - I'll make an exception for you.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: agree with, accept, approve of, endorse
   
   **When to Use**: Formal register; expresses formal objection or offense; emphasizes strong disagreement; can sound stiff or legalistic; followed by "to"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation; "I don't like that" or "I object to that" more natural informally; implies serious objection
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - take strong exception to
   - take particular exception to
   - take great exception to
   - might take exception to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Historical legal language where "take exception" meant to formally object or protest; "take" (adopt position) + "exception" (objection sense); formalized expression from 16th century legal usage
   
   **Root Analysis**: take (adopt, assume) + exception (objection, from Latin exceptio)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I take exception to that remark!
   - Some people might take exception to what you said.

   - almost without exception
   - virtually without exception
   - without a single exception
   - without any exception
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Without exception" is emphatic negative construction stressing complete absence of exceptions; fixed phrase for universal statements; pairs "without" (absence) with "exception" for rhetorical emphasis
   
   **Root Analysis**: without (lacking) + exception (excluded case)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone showed up without exception.
   - They're late every single time, without exception.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: present company excepted (type: fixed phrase/idiom)

   - present company excluded
   - you excepted, of course
   - not including present company
   - except for present company
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: Polite convention from formal social discourse; "present company" (those physically here) + "excepted" (excluded from criticism); face-saving formula allowing criticism without direct offense; established by 17th century
   
   **Root Analysis**: present company (those currently present) + excepted (excluded)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Most people are idiots—present company excepted, of course!

   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: the exception that proves the rule (type: idiomatic phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A case that doesn't fit the general pattern but actually confirms the existence of the rule (paradoxical idiom, often misunderstood)
   - Originally: an exception stated explicitly proves a rule exists for other cases
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed philosophical/logical expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: confirming exception, validating anomaly (no exact synonym due to specific logical meaning)
   
   **Antonyms**: rule-breaking exception, pattern-disproving case
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and informal contexts; often misused to mean "rare exception"; technically means exception's existence implies rule for other cases; philosophical or logical discussions

   **Common Variations**: 
   - exception proving the rule
   - proves the rule
   - that proves the rule
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idiom*: From Latin legal maxim "exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis" (the exception proves the rule in cases not excepted); philosophical paradox that stating exceptions confirms rule's existence; frequently misunderstood in modern usage
   
   **Root Analysis**: the exception (special case) + proves (demonstrates) + the rule (general principle)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He's nice—the exception that proves the rule about lawyers!
   - She's the exception that proves the rule.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: also applies, included, not exempt, subject to the same rule
   
   **Antonyms**: an exception, exempt, excluded, special case
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizes that someone or something is subject to general rule despite possible expectations otherwise; follows pattern "[X] is no exception"; formal and informal
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Requires context establishing general rule first; not used as standalone statement
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - be no exception
   - makes no exception
   - is no exception to this
   - proves no exception
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Negative construction emphasizing inclusion under general principle; "no exception" (not excluded) reinforces universality; rhetorical device strengthening claims of pattern consistency

   **Synonyms**: generally, mostly, in most cases, with rare exceptions, almost universally
   
   **Antonyms**: with many exceptions, rarely, selectively, in few cases
   
   **When to Use**: Hedges universal statements; admits some cases don't fit while maintaining general pattern; formal and informal; more honest than "without exception"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: If exceptions are numerous, use "in some cases" or "sometimes"; "with few exceptions" implies overwhelming majority follow pattern
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - with very few exceptions
   - with only few exceptions
   - with rare exceptions
   - with notable exceptions
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Hedging device allowing general claims while acknowledging limited counter-examples; "few exceptions" quantifies deviation without undermining overall pattern; conventional academic and professional phrasing

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Why This Partnership**:

   - exception to the rule
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: Spatial metaphor ("no room") applied to possibility of exceptions; emphasizes complete absence of space/possibility for deviation; combines physical metaphor with logical concept
