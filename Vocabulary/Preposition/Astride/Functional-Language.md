# Functional Language: Astride

1. **Functional Expression**: How do I position myself astride [the horse/bicycle]? (function: requesting instruction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Asking for guidance on proper straddling position when mounting
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: How should I sit on it?, What's the right way to get on?, Can you show me how to mount properly?, How do I straddle it correctly?
   
   **When to Use**: When learning to ride horses, motorcycles, or bicycles; when seeking instruction from teacher or experienced rider; appropriate for beginners requesting guidance
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Not appropriate when you already know how and just need permission; too basic for experienced riders; avoid if specific problem (use "My leg position feels wrong" instead)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - How should I position myself? (less specific)
   - What's the proper astride position? (more formal)
   - Can you help me get on correctly? (more indirect)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Direct question appropriate in instructional contexts where power relationship (teacher-student) makes directness acceptable; shows willingness to learn proper technique
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Swing your right leg over and settle into the saddle...
   - Let me demonstrate the correct position first...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "How do I get on this thing? Where do my legs go?"
   - "So, I just throw my leg over and sit down, or is there a technique?"
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Could you please instruct me on the proper astride mounting technique?"
   - "What is the recommended procedure for positioning oneself astride the mount?"

1. **Functional Expression**: You need to sit astride, not side-saddle (function: correcting/instructing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Correcting someone's positioning; giving specific instruction about leg placement
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: direct but instructional
   
   **Synonyms**: Put a leg on each side, Straddle it properly, You need to have your legs on either side, Not like that—with both legs apart
   
   **When to Use**: In teaching contexts when correcting improper mounting; when safety requires proper astride position; appropriate from instructor to student or experienced to novice rider
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too direct for peer correction without established teaching relationship; not appropriate if person is intentionally riding side-saddle; avoid if physical limitations prevent astride position
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Make sure you're sitting astride (softer)
   - The proper position is astride, with legs on either side (more explanatory)
   - Try to straddle it, like this (demonstrative)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses negative politeness (direct instruction) appropriate in safety contexts; instructor authority makes directness acceptable; "need to" implies requirement
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, like this? (with adjustment)
   - I'm not sure I can—is it okay if... (expressing difficulty)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: When requesting help from instructor, more experienced rider, or someone in position to demonstrate; appropriate when acknowledging the request involves their effort; shows respect for their time
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for close friends or casual peer situations; not appropriate in urgent situations; overly indirect if demonstration is expected part of instruction
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Can you show me how to mount properly? (less formal)
   - I'd appreciate a demonstration of the mounting technique (more formal)
   - Could you show me the right way to get on? (simplified)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Would you mind..." uses negative politeness to minimize imposition; acknowledges request requires action from other person; appropriate for higher-status person or formal contexts

   **Common Variations**: 
   - I can't seem to stay in position (less technical)
   - My astride positioning needs adjustment (more formal)
