   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard collocation for this position)

   - to sit astride (infinitive)
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

References the Colossus of Rhodes, a giant statue that supposedly stood with legs apart over the harbor entrance. Conveys image of someone so powerful they metaphorically stand over the entire world.

   - to mount astride
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Mount" (climbing onto) naturally pairs with "astride" when the manner of mounting (legs separated) is important; conventional usage in formal equestrian instruction; semantic compatibility between action and resulting position

   **When NOT to Use**: More general than "astride"—use when leg-separation aspect isn't relevant; avoid if "astride" would be more precise for riding contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - spans both sides
   - spanning the divide
   - spanning multiple domains
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Spanning" (extending across) naturally combines with "both sides" to emphasize the bridging nature; semantic compatibility between the action of spanning and the concept of two sides; high frequency of co-occurrence when describing bridges (physical or metaphorical)
