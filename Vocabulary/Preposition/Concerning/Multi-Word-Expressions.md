1. **Expression**: raise concerns (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To bring attention to worries, problems, or issues that need to be addressed; to voice or express reservations about something
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership; "raise" specifically collocates with "concerns")
   
   **Synonyms**: voice concerns, express concerns, flag issues, identify problems, raise objections
   
   **Antonyms**: allay concerns, ease worries, dismiss concerns, express confidence
   
   **When to Use**: Professional meetings, feedback sessions, risk assessments, formal objections; appropriate when diplomatically identifying problems; workplace communication, reports, and reviews
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (sounds overly formal); when direct problem statement is better; avoid when you want to sound solution-focused rather than problem-focused
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - raise serious concerns
   - raise a concern
   - raise concerns about/over
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Raise" is the conventional verb for bringing concerns to attention (like "raise a question" or "raise an issue"); implies elevating something to visible/discussable status; other verbs like "bring up" or "mention" work but lack the formal weight
   
   **Root Analysis**: raise (Old Norse reisa "to lift") + concerns (Latin concernere "to relate to, involve")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "A few people raised concerns about the deadline in our standup today."
   - "I should probably raise this concern with my manager."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The audit committee raised concerns regarding internal controls and financial reporting accuracy."

   **Synonyms**: reason to worry, grounds for concern, red flag, warning sign, troubling issue
   
   **Antonyms**: cause for celebration, reason for optimism, reassuring sign, no cause for alarm
   
   **When to Use**: Risk assessment, analysis, formal evaluations; when diplomatically signaling problems without creating panic; professional reports, medical contexts, management communications
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Emergencies (too understated); casual conversation (sounds formal); when clear direct problem statement is needed
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - serious cause for concern
   - some cause for concern
   - no cause for concern
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Cause" combines with "concern" to create formal, measured expression; historical use in medical and professional contexts established it as standard phrase for diplomatic worry expression; less alarmist than "crisis" but more serious than "issue"
   
   **Root Analysis**: cause (Latin causa "reason") + for (preposition) + concern (Latin concernere)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "The weird noise my car's making is definitely cause for concern."
   - "His mood lately is some cause for concern."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "The declining enrollment figures represent a significant cause for concern requiring immediate strategic attention."

1. **Expression**: express concern (type: collocation)

   **When to Use**: Formal communication, professional feedback, diplomatic objection; written reports, official statements, professional meetings; when being measured and professional in critique

   **Common Variations**: 
   - express deep concern
   - express concerns about
   - express one's concern
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Express" is the conventional verb for formally articulating internal states (like "express gratitude" or "express interest"); preferred in professional contexts over casual "say" or "tell"; implies considered, deliberate communication
   
   **Root Analysis**: express (Latin expressus "pressed out, clearly presented") + concern (Latin concernere)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I expressed my concern to the team about the tight deadline."
   - "She's expressed concern about how much we're spending."

1. **Expression**: growing concern (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - a growing concern
   - growing concerns about
   - cause growing concern
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Growing" naturally combines with "concern" because both concepts involve gradual increase; metaphor of organic growth applies to emotional/cognitive states; conventional in English to describe progressive emotional or social phenomena
   
   **Root Analysis**: growing (grow from Old English growan) + concern (Latin concernere)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "There's growing concern that we won't hit our deadline."
   - "My parents have growing concerns about my career choices."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - matters of concern
   - areas of concern
   - issues of concern
   - items of concern
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Postmodifying "of concern" construction parallels other formal phrases like "of interest" or "of importance"; common in medical (findings of concern), technical, and business English; creates nominal rather than adjectival description
   
   **Root Analysis**: of (preposition) + concern (noun from Latin concernere)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "These are the main things of concern we talked about in the meeting."
   - "Is there anything of concern I should know about?"
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: no cause for concern (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A reassuring statement that there is no reason to worry; nothing problematic or troubling in the situation
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard reassurance formula, especially in medical and professional contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: nothing to worry about, no reason for alarm, all is well, no problems, no need to worry
   
   **Antonyms**: cause for concern, reason to worry, grounds for alarm, problematic situation
   
   **When to Use**: Providing reassurance, responding to worries, medical contexts, status updates; when diplomatically indicating situation is under control; professional and personal contexts

   **Common Variations**: 
   - there's no cause for concern
   - should be no cause for concern
   - nothing that's cause for concern
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Negation of "cause for concern" creates standard reassurance formula; medical and professional contexts established this as preferred diplomatic way to say "everything's fine"; more formal and measured than "don't worry"
   
   **Root Analysis**: no (negative) + cause (Latin causa) + for + concern (Latin concernere)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "The weird sound was just the fan—no cause for concern."
   - "Don't stress, it's no cause for concern."

1. **Expression**: deeply concerned (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**:

   **Synonyms**: extremely worried, gravely concerned, seriously troubled, highly anxious, greatly worried
   
   **Antonyms**: completely unconcerned, entirely reassured, not at all worried
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing severity of worry, formal statements, official responses to serious issues; expressing strong emotional response professionally; written and spoken formal contexts

   **Common Variations**: 
   - deeply concerned about
   - remain deeply concerned
   - growing deeply concerned
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Deeply" metaphorically suggests profound emotional state (depth = intensity); conventional intensifier for emotions in formal English (like "deeply disappointed" or "deeply grateful"); more sophisticated than "very"
   
   **Root Analysis**: deeply (deep from Old English deop + -ly) + concerned (Latin concernere + -ed)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "I'm deeply concerned about how she's been acting lately."
   - "We're all deeply concerned that this won't work out."
