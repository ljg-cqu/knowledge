   **Common Variations**: 
   - underneath it all, though
   - but underneath it all
   - because underneath it all
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The phrase uses spatial metaphor (underneath) to express fundamental truth; "it all" encompasses entire situation/person; originated from the concept of looking beneath surface layers to find core reality

   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - what lies beneath
   - lying just beneath
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Lie" (be positioned) + "beneath" (under/below) form natural partnership for describing position; strengthened by metaphorical extension to causation and fundamentals

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's got hidden depths—she speaks five languages!

   **Root Analysis**: cover (Latin "cooperire") + up (Old English "upp" = completely)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - digging beneath the surface reveals
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Dig" (excavate) + "beneath/below the surface" combines literal excavation metaphor with investigation; suggests effort required to uncover hidden truth; common in analytical writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: dig (Middle English "diggen") + beneath/below + surface
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you dig beneath the surface, you'll find the real story.
