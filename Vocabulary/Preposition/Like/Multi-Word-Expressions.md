1. **Expression**: something like (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - or something like that

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Something" creates indefiniteness while "like" indicates approximation; together they signal intentional vagueness for hedging purposes

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Feel" (internal state) naturally pairs with "like" (preference/similarity) to express desires or perceptions; highly frequent in spoken English
