1. **Linking Word**: like (type: subordinating conjunction/preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce examples or make comparisons; indicates similarity
   - *Function*: Creates comparison or similarity relationship between clauses or elements
   
   **Synonyms**: such as, similar to, as, just as, in the manner of
   
   **Antonyms**: unlike, different from, contrary to, as opposed to
   
   **When to Use**: Informal speech and writing when introducing examples or comparisons; casual explanations and descriptions; conversational contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal academic writing (use "such as" instead); when precise logical connectors are needed; avoiding confusion with "like" as verb; after linking verbs (use "as" instead: "It looks as if...")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [noun/pronoun] + like + [noun phrase]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence, connecting elements
   - [Punctuation]: No comma before "like" when used as preposition; comma possible when used as conjunction
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "like" (comparison) with "as" (in the role of); using "like" after linking verbs instead of "as if"
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Old English "gelīc" (similar, alike)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "gelīc" → Middle English "lik" → Modern English "like" (comparison sense from 14th century)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She sings like an angel—absolutely beautiful voice!
   - It feels like Monday even though it's Tuesday.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The phenomenon resembles behaviors observed in similar contexts.
   - This structure operates in a manner analogous to previous models.

1. **Linking Word**: likewise (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates that what follows is similar to or in agreement with what preceded
   - *Function*: Creates addition/similarity relationship; signals parallel information
   
   **Synonyms**: similarly, in the same way, also, equally, correspondingly
   
   **Antonyms**: conversely, however, on the contrary, in contrast, differently
   
   **When to Use**: Adding parallel information, showing similarity between ideas, formal and academic writing, showing agreement or correspondence; connecting similar examples or situations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When introducing contrasting ideas; casual conversations where simpler words suffice; when "also" would be clearer and less formal
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement 1]. Likewise, [Statement 2].
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), occasionally mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after "likewise" when sentence-initial; commas around it when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "likewise" to introduce contrast; omitting comma after sentence-initial "likewise"
   
   **Root Analysis**: like (similar) + wise (manner, way)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from "like" + "wise" (meaning "manner"). Used as connector from 15th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I enjoyed the movie, and my sister felt likewise.
   - He's not interested in going; likewise for me.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The first experiment yielded positive results; likewise, the second trial confirmed the hypothesis.
   - European markets experienced significant growth; likewise, Asian markets demonstrated strong performance.

1. **Linking Word**: unlike (type: preposition/subordinating element)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate difference or contrast between two things
   - *Function*: Creates contrast relationship; highlights differences
   
   **Synonyms**: in contrast to, different from, as opposed to, contrary to, not like
   
   **Antonyms**: like, similar to, akin to, comparable to, resembling
   
   **When to Use**: Formal and informal writing when emphasizing differences; comparisons that highlight contrasts; showing how something deviates from expectations or norms
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When similarity rather than difference is the focus; when "but" or "however" would create clearer sentence structure
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Unlike [noun phrase], [main clause with contrasting information]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common) or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after introductory "unlike" phrase; no comma when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "unlike" with verb ("unlike he does"—incorrect); confusing with "dislike"
   
   **Root Analysis**: un- (not) + like (similar to)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → from "un-" (negative prefix) + "like". Used as preposition from 16th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Unlike my brother, I actually enjoy waking up early.
   - She's usually on time, unlike today when she was an hour late.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Unlike previous studies, this research employs a longitudinal methodology.
   - The new policy, unlike its predecessor, addresses stakeholder concerns comprehensively.

1. **Linking Word**: just like (type: compound connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Emphasizes strong similarity or exact resemblance between two things
   - *Function*: Creates strong comparison relationship with emphasis
   
   **Synonyms**: exactly like, the same as, similar to, in the same way as, identical to
   
   **Antonyms**: completely unlike, nothing like, totally different from
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing strong similarities, making vivid comparisons, explaining through analogy; casual and semi-formal contexts; when drawing clear parallels
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal academic writing (too emphatic and conversational); when subtle differences exist; legal or technical writing requiring precision
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + [verb] + just like + [noun phrase/clause]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence typically, can be sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: Generally no comma; comma possible for emphasis or with longer clauses
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Overusing in formal contexts; using for approximate rather than close similarities
   
   **Root Analysis**: just (exactly, precisely) + like (similar to)
   
   **Etymology**: Compound expression → "just" (14th c., from Latin "justus") + "like" (OE "gelīc")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You sound just like your mom when you say that!
   - This pizza tastes just like the one we had in Italy.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The mechanism functions in essentially the same manner as the previous model.
   - This situation closely resembles the economic conditions of the 1970s.

1. **Linking Word**: as...as (like) (type: correlative construction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used in comparisons to show equal degree; "like" sometimes follows for approximation
   - *Function*: Creates equality comparison; expresses degree equivalence
   
   **Synonyms**: equally [adjective] as, the same level of [noun] as, to the same degree as
   
   **Antonyms**: more...than, less...than, not as...as
   
   **When to Use**: Making equal comparisons, expressing similarity in degree or extent; works in all registers; especially useful for nuanced comparisons
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When indicating inequality (use "more than" or "less than"); when informal "like" might confuse the comparison
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + [be/verb] + as + [adjective/adverb] + as + [comparison element]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence as part of predicate
   - [Punctuation]: No special punctuation needed
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "than" instead of second "as"; using "like" when "as" is required in formal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: Correlative pair → as (to the degree that) + as (when compared to)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "ealswā" → Middle English "als" → Modern English "as". Correlative construction from 12th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She's as tall as her brother now—maybe even taller!
   - This coffee isn't as strong as I like it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The results were as significant as those obtained in previous trials.
   - This methodology is as rigorous as any employed in contemporary research.
