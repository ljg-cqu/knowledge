1. **Linking Word**: since (type: subordinating conjunction—temporal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From a particular time in the past until now or until another specified past time. Used to connect a time clause with a main clause, showing that the situation in the main clause has continued from the time mentioned in the subordinate clause.
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship showing continuity from past to present/reference point
   
   **Synonyms**: from the time that, from when, ever since (emphatic), from the moment
   
   **Antonyms**: until, till, before (these mark endpoints rather than starting points)
   
   **When to Use**: Use temporal "since" to connect a subordinate clause indicating when something started with a main clause describing an ongoing situation. Typically requires present perfect or past perfect tense in the main clause. Common in both spoken and written English for expressing duration from a past point.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using with simple present or simple past in the main clause when describing ongoing situations (use present perfect instead). Don't confuse temporal "since" with causal "since." Don't use when you need "for" with a duration. Wrong: "I know him since three years" ✗ | Correct: "I've known him since he moved here" ✓
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main clause with present/past perfect] + since + [past tense time clause]
     - Example: "I have lived here since I graduated from college."
   - [Position]: "since" clause can come before or after main clause
     - After: "She has been happy since she got the new job."
     - Before: "Since they moved to the city, they've made many friends."
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "since" clause comes first; no comma when it comes after main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: 
     - Using simple past in main clause: "I lived here since 2015" ✗
     - Confusing with "for": "since three weeks" ✗
     - Using present tense after "since": "since he arrives" ✗
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English *siþþan* (then, afterwards, since)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *siþþan* → Middle English *sithenes* → Modern "since". Developed conjunction function to introduce temporal subordinate clauses by Middle English period.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've been feeling way better since I started exercising regularly.
   - Since we last talked, a lot has changed around here.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization has implemented numerous reforms since the board appointed new leadership.
   - Since the study commenced in 2018, researchers have collected extensive data on climate patterns.

2. **Linking Word**: since (type: subordinating conjunction—causal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Because; for the reason that; as. Used to introduce a reason or explanation for the statement in the main clause. Indicates that the information in the "since" clause is the cause or justification for the main clause.
   - *Function*: Creates causal/logical relationship showing reason or justification
   
   **Synonyms**: because, as, seeing that, given that, considering that, inasmuch as
   
   **Antonyms**: although, even though, despite the fact that (these show contrast rather than cause)
   
   **When to Use**: Use causal "since" to provide reasons or explanations, especially when the reason is already known or assumed to be true by both speaker and listener. More common in formal writing than casual speech. Typically appears at the beginning of a sentence for emphasis. Preferred when the reason is treated as given information or background.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual conversation (use "because" instead). Don't use when the reason is new, surprising, or the main focus (use "because"). Avoid when temporal confusion might arise ("Since I arrived" could be temporal or causal—context must be clear). Not preferred in questions or negatives. In academic writing, some style guides prefer "because" over "since" for clarity.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Since + [reason clause], [main clause result/action]
     - Example: "Since you're already here, why don't you stay for dinner?"
   - [Position]: Can come before or after main clause, but initial position is more common
     - Before (more common): "Since it's raining, we'll postpone the event."
     - After (less common): "We'll postpone the event since it's raining."
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "since" clause comes first; comma optional when it comes after
   - [Common errors to avoid]: 
     - Ambiguity with temporal meaning: "Since we met" (time or reason?)
     - Overuse in casual speech (sounds formal)
     - Using in contexts where "because" would be clearer
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same origin as temporal "since"—Old English *siþþan*
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *siþþan* → extended from temporal meaning to causal meaning in Middle English. The causal sense developed from "from the time that" → "given that" → "because."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Since you're buying, I'll have the steak!
   - We might as well walk since the bus isn't coming.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Since the evidence overwhelmingly supports this conclusion, we recommend immediate policy changes.
   - The proposal has been approved since it meets all regulatory requirements.

3. **Linking Word**: ever since (type: emphatic subordinating conjunction—temporal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From that particular time onward; continuously from a specific past point. An emphatic form of "since" that stresses the continuous nature of the situation from the mentioned time until now.
   - *Function*: Creates emphatic temporal relationship with stress on continuity and persistence
   
   **Synonyms**: since then, from that time on, from that point forward, continuously since
   
   **Antonyms**: never since, not since then
   
   **When to Use**: Use "ever since" for emphasis when you want to highlight that something has been consistently true or ongoing from a particular point. Common in both spoken and written English when the speaker wants to emphasize duration or persistence. Particularly effective when describing life-changing events or significant turning points.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when simple "since" would suffice without need for emphasis. Don't use in very formal academic prose where emphasis might seem emotional. Avoid overuse—reserve for genuinely significant or long-lasting changes.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main clause present/past perfect] + ever since + [past tense event]
     - Example: "She's been afraid of dogs ever since she was bitten as a child."
   - [Position]: Typically follows main clause, but can precede for dramatic effect
   - [Punctuation]: Comma often used when clause is at end for emphasis
   - [Emphasis pattern]: "Ever since that day/moment/time..."
   
   **Root Analysis**: "ever" (Old English *ǣfre* = always, at any time) + "since"
   
   **Etymology**: Combination of "ever" + "since" emerged in Middle English to create emphatic temporal marker. "Ever" intensifies the continuous meaning of "since."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've loved Italian food ever since I visited Rome in college.
   - Things haven't been the same ever since Mom moved out.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The institution has maintained this policy ever since its founding in 1892.
   - Public opinion has shifted dramatically ever since the report was published.

4. **Linking Word**: long since (type: discourse marker—temporal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A long time ago; in the distant past and no longer true or relevant. Used to emphasize that something ended or changed a considerable time ago.
   - *Function*: Creates temporal distance, indicating something is firmly in the past
   
   **Synonyms**: long ago, a long time ago, ages ago, in the distant past
   
   **Antonyms**: recently, lately, just now, only recently
   
   **When to Use**: Use "long since" to emphasize that something is definitively past and no longer current. Common in both narrative and expository writing. Often used with perfect tenses. Particularly effective for dramatic or literary effect when contrasting past and present states.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (use "ages ago" or "a long time ago"). Don't use when the timeframe is recent or unclear. Avoid when precision is needed (use specific time references instead).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Structure]: [subject] + have/has + [past participle] + long since
     - Example: "The building has long since been demolished."
   - [Pattern]: "long since" + past participle
     - Example: "The old traditions are long since forgotten."
   - [Position]: Typically mid-sentence, between auxiliary and main verb
   
   **Root Analysis**: "long" (Old English *lang* = extended in time) + "since"
   
   **Etymology**: Combination emphasizing temporal distance, established in Early Modern English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That restaurant closed down long since—it's a bank now.
   - I've long since given up trying to change his mind.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The practice has long since been abandoned in modern medical contexts.
   - These theories have long since been superseded by more comprehensive models.
