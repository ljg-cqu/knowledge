1. **Functional Expression**: Since you mentioned/brought up [topic]... (function: topic transition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A pragmatic device for transitioning to a related topic that was previously mentioned. Shows that the speaker is taking advantage of an opportunity to discuss something relevant.
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect (polite topic shift)
   
   **Synonyms**: Speaking of [topic]..., On that note..., While we're on the subject..., That reminds me...
   
   **Antonyms**: To change the subject completely..., On an unrelated note... (these mark discontinuity rather than connection)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to shift conversation to a related topic smoothly. Appropriate in meetings, discussions, or conversations when someone has provided an opening to discuss your topic. Shows attentiveness to previous speaker while advancing your agenda.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when your topic is truly unrelated (dishonest connection). Don't use to interrupt inappropriately—wait for conversational opening. Not suitable when abrupt topic changes are expected (e.g., formal presentations with set agendas).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Since you brought that up...
   - Since we're talking about [topic]...
   - Since you mentioned [specific thing]...
   - Now that you mention [topic]...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression uses positive politeness strategy—building on others' contributions. Shows collaborative conversation management. The "since" creates causal link: "because you mentioned X, I will now discuss related Y."
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Yes, go ahead." / "Sure, what about it?" / "Good point."
   - Redirecting: "Actually, let's stick to the original topic for now." / "Can we come back to that later?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A: "I'm thinking of getting a new phone." B: "Oh, since you mentioned phones, have you seen the latest model?"
   - Since you brought up vacation plans, when are you thinking of going?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Since you mentioned budget constraints, I would like to present a cost-effective alternative approach.
   - Since the committee brought up sustainability concerns, perhaps we should discuss our environmental impact assessment.

2. **Functional Expression**: Since you're [doing X], could you... (function: requesting politely)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request structure that grounds the request in the listener's current or planned action. Minimizes imposition by suggesting the request is convenient given what the person is already doing.
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal
   - *Directness*: indirect (mitigated request)
   
   **Synonyms**: While you're [doing X], could you..., If you're [doing X] anyway, would you mind..., As long as you're [doing X]...
   
   **Antonyms**: I need you to... (direct command, no mitigation)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when making requests that align with what someone is already doing or planning. Appropriate among colleagues, friends, family. Particularly effective when the additional task is minimal. Shows consideration by framing request as convenient rather than burdensome.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when the person isn't actually doing the prerequisite action (seems manipulative). Avoid with superiors unless relationship is very casual. Don't use for urgent requests that need immediate attention regardless of convenience.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Since you're going to [place], could you...
   - Since you're already [doing X], would you mind...
   - Since you're there anyway, can you...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Uses negative politeness strategy—minimizing imposition. The "since" clause provides justification, making request seem more reasonable. Works through implicature: "this won't be much trouble for you."
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Sure, no problem." / "Of course, I can do that." / "Yeah, I'll grab one for you."
   - Declining: "Actually, I'm in a rush." / "Sorry, I'm not going that way." / "I'd rather not this time."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Since you're going to the kitchen, could you grab me a water?
   - Hey, since you're in town, could you swing by and pick up that package?

3. **Functional Expression**: Since when [do/does/is]...? (function: expressing surprise/challenging)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A rhetorical question expressing surprise, skepticism, or challenge regarding a change or new information. Often implies that the speaker believes the situation was different before or questions the validity of the claim.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct (confrontational potential)
   
   **Synonyms**: When did [this start happening]?, How long has this been going on?, That's new—when did that change?
   
   **Antonyms**: I've always known that..., That's how it's always been... (acceptance rather than challenge)
   
   **When to Use**: Use informally among equals when genuinely surprised or when playfully challenging someone. Can express legitimate curiosity with appropriate tone. Common in heated discussions or when questioning inconsistencies.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - Since when do you [care about X]?
   - Since when is [X] acceptable?
   - Since when has [this been the case]?
   - Since when are you [description]?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Often functions as face-threatening act—questions speaker's credibility or consistency. Can be softened with tone, but inherently challenges. Use with caution as it can damage relationships if mishandled.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Defensive: "Hey, I'm allowed to change my mind!" / "Why does it matter?"
   - Explanatory: "Actually, since [event/time], I've been more interested in it."
   - Counter-challenge: "Since when do I need your approval?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Since when do you like horror movies? I thought you hated them!
   - Wait, since when is parking not allowed here?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - A pragmatic device for proposing that the group take advantage of everyone's presence to accomplish something. Creates justification for suggestion based on convenient circumstances.

   **Synonyms**: Now that everyone's here..., While we're all together..., As long as we're all here...
   
   **Antonyms**: Let's meet another time when... (defers action to future)

   - Now that we're all here...
   - While we have everyone in the room...

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Good idea, let's do it." / "Sure, might as well." / "Makes sense."
   - Declining: "Actually, I need to leave soon." / "Can we schedule this properly?" / "I'm not prepared for that right now."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Since we're all here, why don't we just watch the movie now instead of waiting?
   - Hey, since the whole family's here, should we take a group photo?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Since we are all present, I propose we address the outstanding budget issues before adjourning.

5. **Functional Expression**: Since you asked... (function: providing information with justification)

   - Well, since you asked...
   - Since you want to know...
   - Since you brought it up...

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Yes, I want your honest opinion." / "Go ahead, I can handle it."
   - Regretting: "On second thought, maybe I don't want to know." / "Okay, I'm bracing myself."
