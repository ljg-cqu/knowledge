1. **Preposition**: since (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* From a particular time in the past until now or until another time in the past. Used to indicate the starting point of a period that continues to the present or to a specified time.
   - *(Note)* "Since" requires a specific point in time (not a duration). Use with dates, events, or time expressions that mark a moment.
   
   **Synonyms**: from (in temporal context), starting from, beginning at, as of
   
   **Antonyms**: until, till, up to, before
   
   **When to Use**: Use "since" to mark the beginning point of a continuing situation. Common with present perfect tense ("I have lived here since 2015"), past perfect ("She had worked there since 2010"), or present perfect continuous ("They've been waiting since noon"). Use with specific time markers: dates, days, events, or time points.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "since" with durations or periods of time (use "for" instead). Wrong: "since three years" ✗ | Correct: "for three years" ✓. Do not use with simple past when describing a completed past action without connection to present. Do not confuse temporal "since" with causal "since" (because).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: since Monday, since childhood, since birth, since the beginning, since then, since last year, since the accident, since 9 a.m., since the 1990s
   - **Verb + since**: has been since, have lived since, worked since, stayed since, remained since
   - **Time expressions + since**: ever since, long since, not since, just since
   
   **Root Analysis**: Middle English "sithenes" → Old English "siththan" = "after that, afterwards"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *siþþan* (afterwards, subsequently) → Middle English *sithenes* → Modern English "since". Originally meant "afterwards" or "from then until now," combining temporal and sequential meanings.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I haven't seen Tom since last summer—wonder what he's up to now.
   - She's been super stressed since the new boss started.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The company has experienced consistent growth since its establishment in 2005.
   - Since the implementation of the new policy, employee satisfaction has improved measurably.

2. **Preposition**: since (extended temporal use with events)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* From the time of a particular past event until now or until another specified time. Used when the starting point is defined by an event rather than a clock time.
   
   **Synonyms**: from the time of, following, after (in some contexts), subsequent to
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, preceding
   
   **When to Use**: Use when the starting point is a significant event or occurrence that marks the beginning of a continuing state. Commonly used with: life events (since graduation, since marriage), historical events (since the war, since independence), personal experiences (since the accident, since moving here).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the event is not a clear temporal marker. Avoid using "since" with events that don't establish a continuing state or situation. Don't use when you mean "during" (a period including the event itself).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Event markers**: since graduation, since childhood, since retirement, since the pandemic, since the revolution, since independence
   - **With possessives**: since his departure, since their arrival, since my promotion
   - **Ever since + event**: ever since the accident, ever since we met, ever since that day
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as above—Old English *siþþan*
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *siþþan* → developed to mark event-based temporal reference points in Middle English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Things have been different since Dad retired—he's around the house all the time now.
   - I've been way more careful since that near-miss on the highway.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The institution has undergone significant transformation since the appointment of the new director.
   - Economic indicators have shown marked improvement since the recession ended.
