**Note**: "Since" is a preposition and conjunction with no direct adjective derivatives. However, the following temporal and descriptive adjectives commonly appear in contexts discussing duration, continuity, or temporal relationships expressed by "since."

1. **Adjective**: ongoing
   **Meaning**: 
   - Continuing to exist or develop; still in progress. Used to describe situations, processes, or states that began in the past and continue into the present—often the type of situations described using "since."
   - *(Pattern)* Often modifies nouns describing situations, projects, or processes
   
   **Synonyms**: continuing, in progress, developing, unfinished, current
   
   **Antonyms**: completed, finished, concluded, ended, terminated
   
   **When to Use**: Use "ongoing" to emphasize the continuing nature of a situation. Particularly useful when you want to stress that something hasn't concluded. Common in professional, academic, and formal contexts to describe active projects, situations, or processes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when something has clearly ended. Don't use redundantly with present continuous tenses. Avoid in casual conversation where simpler terms work ("happening now" vs. "ongoing").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - ongoing situation
   - ongoing process
   - ongoing project
   - ongoing investigation
   - ongoing commitment
   
   **Root Analysis**: on- (continuing) + go + -ing (participle/adjective suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: "On" + "going" (present participle of "go") → Modern usage as adjective meaning "continuing" emerged in 20th century
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's an ongoing thing—we've been dealing with it since last month.
   - The noise from construction is an ongoing problem since they started in March.

2. **Adjective**: continuous
   **Meaning**: 
   - Forming an unbroken whole; without interruption. Describes situations that persist without gaps—the type of duration often expressed using "since" with present perfect continuous.
   - *(Gradable)* Can be modified by "very," "quite," "more," etc.
   
   **Synonyms**: uninterrupted, constant, unbroken, ceaseless, perpetual
   
   **Antonyms**: intermittent, sporadic, interrupted, broken, discontinuous
   
   **When to Use**: Use "continuous" to emphasize lack of interruption in a process or state. Appropriate in technical, professional, and academic contexts. Particularly useful when continuity itself is the important feature.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when interruptions have occurred (use "intermittent" instead). Don't confuse with "continual" (which allows for breaks). Avoid hyperbole—reserve for truly uninterrupted situations.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - continuous improvement
   - continuous process
   - continuous operation
   - continuous presence
   - continuous service
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin *continuus* (uninterrupted) + -ous (adjective suffix)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - consistent performance
   - consistent results
   - consistent with
   - consistent approach
   - consistent improvement
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin *consistere* (to stand firm) + -ent (adjective suffix)
