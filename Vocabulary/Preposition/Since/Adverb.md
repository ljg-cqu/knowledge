1. **Adverb**: since (type: time—referring to past time until now)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From a particular time in the past until now; between a past time and the present. Used as an adverb without a following time expression, referring back to a previously mentioned time point. Often appears at the end of clauses.
   - *(Position)* Typically end position; occasionally mid-position
   
   **Synonyms**: from then, from that time, after that, subsequently
   
   **Antonyms**: before then, previously, prior to that
   
   **When to Use**: Use "since" as an adverb when the time reference is already clear from context, allowing you to avoid repetition. Common in both spoken and written English. Particularly useful for discourse cohesion—avoiding restating time already mentioned.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when no time reference has been established in prior discourse (confusing). Don't use when specific time repetition would be clearer. Avoid in formal writing that requires explicit references.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - hasn't been seen since
   - haven't heard since
   - ever since (emphatic)
   - long since (distant past)
   - not since
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as preposition/conjunction usage—Old English *siþþan*
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *siþþan* (afterwards) → Middle English → Modern adverbial usage "since" (referring to time without explicit object)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He moved to Japan last year and I haven't heard from him since.
   - They broke up in March, and she's been way happier since.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The regulation was enacted in 2015 and has been enforced consistently since.
   - The committee convened in January; no meetings have occurred since.

2. **Adverb**: continuously (type: manner/duration—describing how action occurs)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that forms an unbroken whole; without interruption. Used to modify verbs describing actions or states that persist without breaks—the type of duration often expressed by "since" constructions.
   - *(Position)* Typically end position or before main verb
   
   **Synonyms**: constantly, uninterruptedly, incessantly, ceaselessly, perpetually
   
   **Antonyms**: intermittently, sporadically, occasionally, periodically
   
   **When to Use**: Use "continuously" to emphasize that an action or state has occurred without any interruption. Particularly useful when the lack of breaks is significant or noteworthy. Common in technical, professional, and formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when interruptions have occurred (use "regularly" or "frequently" instead). Don't confuse with "continually" (which allows breaks). Avoid hyperbole—reserve for truly uninterrupted situations.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - continuously operating
   - continuously improving
   - continuously monitoring
   - running continuously
   - working continuously
   
   **Root Analysis**: continuous (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *continuus* → continuous (adj.) → continuously (adv.)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The baby's been crying continuously since midnight—we're exhausted!
   - I've been working continuously since 8 a.m. without a break.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The system has operated continuously since installation without significant downtime.
   - Data has been collected continuously since the study commenced in 2018.

3. **Adverb**: consistently (type: manner—describing how action occurs)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that does not vary; uniformly over time. Modifies verbs to indicate that actions have been performed in the same manner repeatedly since a particular time.
   - *(Position)* Typically before main verb or end position
   
   **Synonyms**: uniformly, steadily, regularly, reliably, dependably
   
   **Antonyms**: inconsistently, erratically, irregularly, unpredictably
   
   **When to Use**: Use "consistently" to emphasize reliability, stability, or predictable patterns in how actions are performed. Common in performance discussions, quality assessments, and descriptions of reliable behaviors.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when variation has actually occurred. Don't use when unpredictability is the reality. Avoid as filler word without meaningful emphasis on uniformity.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - consistently performing
   - consistently delivering
   - consistently high/low
   - ranked consistently
   - grown consistently
   
   **Root Analysis**: consistent (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)

4. **Adverb**: recently (type: time—indicating near past)
   **Meaning**:

   **Synonyms**: lately, not long ago, just now, of late
   
   **Antonyms**: long ago, anciently, formerly, previously
   
   **When to Use**: Use "recently" to indicate near-past timing without specifying exact time. Useful when precision isn't needed or available. Common in conversation and informal writing for establishing temporal context.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when specific dates are required or available. Don't use for events long ago. Avoid vagueness in formal contexts requiring precision.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - more recently
   - most recently
   - only recently
   - quite recently
   - as recently as
   
   **Root Analysis**: recent (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)

5. **Adverb**: previously (type: time—indicating earlier time)

   - At an earlier time; before the present or a specified time. Often used to describe states or situations that existed before the "since" reference point, establishing contrast with current conditions.
   - *(Position)* Front position or mid-position (before main verb)
   
   **Synonyms**: formerly, earlier, beforehand, prior to this, in the past
   
   **Antonyms**: subsequently, afterward, later, following, since
   
   **When to Use**: Use "previously" to refer to time before a reference point, often contrasting earlier states with current situations. Common in formal writing, reports, and narratives requiring clear temporal sequences.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (use "before" or "earlier"). Don't use when referring to future. Avoid redundancy with other past markers.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - previously mentioned
   - previously reported
   - as previously stated
   - had previously
   - previously unknown
   
   **Root Analysis**: previous (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)

6. **Adverb**: perpetually (type: time/manner—indicating continuous ongoing state)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that never ends or changes; constantly and unchangingly. Emphasizes extreme duration and persistence, often used to describe situations that have existed since time immemorial or for very long periods.

   **Synonyms**: constantly, always, continually, endlessly, eternally
   
   **Antonyms**: temporarily, briefly, momentarily, occasionally
   
   **When to Use**: Use "perpetually" for emphasis or hyperbole when describing very long-lasting or seemingly endless conditions. Effective for dramatic effect or when genuinely describing unchanging states.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in literal contexts requiring precision (sounds exaggerated). Don't use for genuinely temporary situations. Avoid overuse—loses impact if used frequently.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - perpetually dissatisfied
   - perpetually late
   - perpetually changing
   - perpetually young
   - perpetually busy
   
   **Root Analysis**: perpetual (adjective) + -ly (adverb suffix)

   **Synonyms**: from then on, after that, subsequently, afterward, since then
   
   **Antonyms**: before that, prior to that, previously, theretofore
   
   **When to Use**: Use "thereafter" in formal writing, legal documents, academic texts, and official communications when referring to time following a specified point. More formal than "since then" or "after that."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (sounds archaic or overly formal). Don't use when simple alternatives would be clearer and more appropriate for audience.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - shortly thereafter
   - immediately thereafter
   - soon thereafter
   - years thereafter
   - from [date] and thereafter
   
   **Root Analysis**: there + after (compound adverb)

   **Antonyms**: backward, back, previously

   - from [date/time] onwards/onward
   - from then onwards/onward
   - from that point onwards/onward
