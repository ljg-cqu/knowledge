1. **Expression**: ever since (type: fixed phrase—emphatic temporal marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From that particular time until now; continuously from a specific past point. An emphatic form that stresses the continuous and unbroken nature of a situation from a specified time to the present.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership—"ever" always precedes "since" in this usage)
   
   **Synonyms**: from that time on, since then, from then onward, continuously since
   
   **Antonyms**: never since, not since then, only recently
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasizing that something has been consistently true without interruption from a past point until now. Particularly effective when describing life-changing events, persistent conditions, or emphasizing duration. Common in both spoken and written narrative.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when simple "since" would suffice without emphasis. Avoid overuse—reserve for genuinely significant ongoing situations. Not needed in formal academic prose where emphasis might seem emotional rather than analytical.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - ever since then
   - ever since that day/time/moment
   - ever since the [event]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: "Ever" (meaning "always" or "at any time") intensifies the temporal continuity of "since." The combination emerged in Middle English to create emphatic temporal expression. "Ever" adds emotional or dramatic weight to the temporal marker, suggesting significance of the starting point.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "ever" (Old English *ǣfre* = always, at any time) + "since" (Old English *siþþan* = from that time)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've been obsessed with that band ever since I heard them live.
   - Ever since we moved here, life has been so much better.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The policy has remained in effect ever since its implementation in 1995.
   - Public perception has evolved dramatically ever since the initial findings were published.

2. **Expression**: long since (type: fixed phrase—distant past marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A long time ago; in the distant past and no longer current or relevant. Used to emphasize that something ended, changed, or occurred far in the past.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed collocation—"long" modifies the temporal distance of "since")
   
   **Synonyms**: long ago, ages ago, a long time ago, in the distant past
   
   **Antonyms**: recently, lately, just now, not long ago
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize temporal distance and that something is definitively past. Effective in narrative, historical discourse, or when contrasting past and present states. Often used with present perfect tense to show completed past action with present relevance.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (prefer "ages ago" or "a long time ago"). Don't use when timeframe is recent or needs precision. Not appropriate when the exact time matters—use specific dates instead.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - have/has long since [past participle]
   - long since forgotten/abandoned/disappeared
   - long since gone
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Long" as temporal adjective naturally combines with "since" to emphasize duration of time passage. The phrase crystallized in Early Modern English as standard way to express distant past.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "long" (Old English *lang* = extended in time or space) + "since"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That restaurant closed long since—it's been a coffee shop for years now.
   - I've long since given up trying to change his mind about politics.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The practice has long since been discontinued in modern medical contexts.
   - These theories have long since been superseded by more comprehensive models.

3. **Expression**: since time immemorial (type: idiom—fixed legal/historical phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From a time so long ago that it is beyond memory or record; from ancient times. Legal and historical term indicating practices or conditions that have existed for an extremely long period.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (legal/historical fixed phrase—archaic register)
   
   **Synonyms**: from ancient times, since ancient days, from time out of mind, since the beginning of recorded history
   
   **Antonyms**: recently established, newly implemented, modern innovation
   
   **When to Use**: Use in legal contexts, historical writing, or formal discourse when emphasizing extreme antiquity of traditions, rights, or practices. Effective for rhetorical emphasis of long-standing customs. Common in legal documents and historical analysis.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation (sounds archaic and pompous). Don't use when specific dates are available or needed. Not appropriate for recent history or modern contexts. Can sound melodramatic if misused.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - from time immemorial
   - since immemorial times
   - time immemorial
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Legal and historical formula dating to medieval English law. "Immemorial" (Latin *immemorialis* = beyond memory) combines with "time" and "since" to create formal phrase indicating antiquity beyond documentation. First known use in English common law contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "time" + "immemorial" (Latin *in-* = not + *memorialis* = able to be remembered)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - *Typically formal; avoid in casual contexts*
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The community has held fishing rights in these waters since time immemorial.
   - These rituals have been practiced since time immemorial, predating written historical records.

4. **Expression**: since [day/date/year] (type: collocation—temporal prepositional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From a specific point in time until now. Strong collocation pattern using "since" with explicit temporal markers to establish the starting point of a continuing situation.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred pattern for expressing temporal starting points)
   
   **Synonyms**: from [date] onward, starting [date], beginning [date], as of [date]
   
   **Antonyms**: until [date], before [date], up to [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Use to mark precise beginning of ongoing situations. Essential for dating events, experiences, or durations. Common in biographies, CVs, timelines, and any context requiring temporal precision. Works with present perfect or past perfect tense.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use with durations (use "for" instead). Avoid with ongoing present tense unless expressing timeless truths. Wrong: "since three months" ✗ | Correct: "since March" ✓
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - since [specific date]: since June 15, 2020
   - since [month/year]: since December, since 2015
   - since [day]: since Monday, since yesterday, since last week
   - since [time]: since 9 a.m., since noon
   - since [event-date]: since my birthday, since the meeting
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Since" grammatically requires a point in time (not duration), creating natural strong collocation with dates, times, and temporal markers. High frequency of co-occurrence in all registers of English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "since" + temporal noun/noun phrase
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I haven't seen her since Tuesday—hope she's okay.
   - We've been friends since high school, like twenty years now.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

5. **Expression**: since the beginning (type: collocation—temporal reference phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From the start or origin point of something until now. Used to emphasize that a situation, quality, or condition has been present from the very first moment.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common collocation emphasizing origin point)
   
   **Synonyms**: from the start, from the outset, from day one, since inception, since the very beginning
   
   **Antonyms**: only recently, just lately, toward the end
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize continuity from origin. Effective for stressing consistency, persistent qualities, or fundamental characteristics. Common in narrative, descriptions of ongoing situations, and when emphasizing unchanging nature of something.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when something actually changed over time (dishonest claim). Don't use when specific date would be more informative and appropriate.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - since the very beginning
   - since the beginning of [time period]
   - from the beginning
   - right from the beginning
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Since" naturally pairs with "beginning" as archetypal starting point. High frequency due to usefulness in marking absolute origins. "The beginning" serves as definitive temporal marker.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "since" + "the beginning" (Old English *beginnung* = start, commencement)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've known since the beginning that they were perfect for each other.
   - Since the beginning, this job has been nothing but stress.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization has maintained its core values since the beginning of its operations.

6. **Expression**: since then (type: fixed phrase—anaphoric temporal reference)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From that previously mentioned time until now. Anaphoric expression referring back to a time point already established in discourse.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed collocation—"then" serves as pro-form for previously mentioned time)
   
   **Synonyms**: from that time, from that point on, after that, subsequently
   
   **Antonyms**: before that, prior to that, until then
   
   **When to Use**: Use to refer back to a previously mentioned time without repeating it. Essential for discourse cohesion in narrative and explanatory text. Connects current state to past reference point already introduced.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when no clear time reference has been established earlier in discourse (confusing). Don't use when specific time repetition would be clearer for readers unfamiliar with context.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - ever since then
   - not since then
   - from then on
   - and since then
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Then" functions as temporal pro-form (stands in for previously mentioned time), making it natural partner for "since" when avoiding repetition. Grammaticalized as discourse cohesion device.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "since" + "then" (Old English *þænne* = at that time)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We met at that conference in 2019, and I've been following her work since then.
   - He moved to Chicago last year. Since then, we've hardly talked.

7. **Expression**: since [possessive] [noun] (type: collocation pattern—event-based temporal marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - From the time of someone's action, experience, or associated event until now. Pattern using possessive + noun to mark personal or specific events as temporal reference points.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (productive collocation pattern)
   
   **Synonyms**: from the time of [their action], after [their action], following [their action]
   
   **Antonyms**: before [their action], prior to [their action]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when personal events or actions serve as meaningful temporal markers. Common in narrative, biographical writing, and explanations of changes linked to specific people's actions or experiences.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when impersonal time reference would be clearer or more appropriate. Don't use when possessive relationship is unclear or confusing.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - since his/her/their departure/arrival/appointment/retirement
   - since my graduation/promotion/diagnosis/recovery
   - since your suggestion/intervention/involvement
   - since its inception/founding/establishment
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Since" requires time reference; possessive + noun construction efficiently packages both agent and event into compact temporal marker. Highly productive pattern in English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "since" + [possessive pronoun/noun's] + [event noun]
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Since his retirement, Dad's been driving Mom crazy with all his projects.
   - I've been way more productive since your suggestion to use that app.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: it hasn't happened since, last time was [time], the last occurrence was
   
   **Antonyms**: continuously since, ever since, repeatedly since
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize how long something hasn't happened or to mark the last occurrence. Effective for highlighting change, absence, or notable breaks in patterns. Common in both narrative and explanatory contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when positive statement would be clearer. Don't use when the gap is insignificant or expected.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - not since [specific time]
   - not seen/heard/done since
   - nothing like this since
   - not [this adjective] since
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Negation + "since" creates emphatic structure marking boundaries and absences. Establishes last known occurrence as reference point. Grammaticalized as standard way to express temporal gaps.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "not" (negation) + "since" + [time reference]
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I haven't slept this well since before the baby was born!
   - We haven't had a vacation like this since our honeymoon.
