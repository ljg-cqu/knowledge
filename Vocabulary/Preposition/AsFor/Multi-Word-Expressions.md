1. **Expression**: as for (type: phrasal preposition / discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase used to introduce a new topic or shift attention to a different subject in a discussion; means "concerning," "regarding," or "with respect to." Often used to give separate treatment to different topics or to contrast with what was previously mentioned.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the words "as" and "for" must appear together in this specific order for this meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: regarding, concerning, with regard to, as to, when it comes to
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (no opposite for topic-marking function)
   
   **When to Use**: Use at the beginning of sentences to introduce new topics, when organizing discussions with multiple subjects, when contrasting different people or things, in both spoken and written discourse, appropriate across formality levels from casual to formal.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't overuse in quick succession (sounds repetitive), avoid when natural topic flow exists, not typically used mid-sentence, inappropriate when no clear topic shift is needed, less common in highly formal academic writing (prefer "regarding" or "with respect to").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - As to (similar but more formal, often involves uncertainty)
   - As regards (more formal British usage)
   - Now, as for (adds temporal marker for emphasis)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The combination of "as" (in the manner/respect of) + "for" (concerning) creates a fixed phrase with discourse-organizing function. The pairing emerged in Middle English as a way to mark topic shifts explicitly, combining the comparative function of "as" with the concerning function of "for."
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (Old English "eallswā") + for (Old English "for")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The movie was okay. As for the snacks, they were overpriced.
   - I'm ready to go. As for Sarah, who knows what she's doing.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The budget has been approved. As for the implementation timeline, further discussion is required.
   - As for the methodology employed in this research, several significant innovations were introduced.

1. **Expression**: as long as (type: correlative conjunction phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Conditional)* Provided that; on the condition that; if and only if. Used to set conditions or requirements.
   - *(Duration)* For the entire time that; throughout the period that. Used to indicate temporal extent.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (all three words required in sequence)
   
   **Synonyms**: provided that (conditional), on condition that (conditional), while (duration), throughout the time that (duration)
   
   **Antonyms**: unless (negative condition), regardless of (unconditional)
   
   **When to Use**: Use to set conditions in agreements or statements, when indicating duration or temporal extent, in both casual and formal contexts, when establishing requirements or limitations, common in conditional clauses.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when unconditional statements are needed, don't confuse conditional and duration meanings (context determines which), inappropriate when "if" alone would be clearer and simpler.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just as long as (adds emphasis)
   - For as long as (emphasizes duration)
   - So long as (similar, slightly more formal)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "as" (degree comparison) + "long" (extent/duration) + "as" (comparative) to create expression showing extent of time or extent of conditions. The construction parallels other "as...as" comparison structures but specialized for duration/conditions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (extent marker) + long (duration/extent) + as (comparative conjunction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You can stay as long as you want. (duration)
   - I don't care what we eat, as long as it's not too spicy. (condition)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The agreement remains valid as long as all parties fulfill their obligations. (condition)
   - Participants may continue as long as they meet the eligibility criteria. (condition)

1. **Expression**: as well as (type: coordinating phrase / conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In addition to; and also; together with. Used to add information or include additional elements, often with emphasis on the first element mentioned.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (all words required in this order)
   
   **Synonyms**: in addition to, and also, together with, along with, besides
   
   **Antonyms**: but not, excluding, except for, without
   
   **When to Use**: Use to add items or information, when both elements are important but first has primacy, in both formal and informal contexts, when combining elements in a list, when emphasizing inclusion, works across all registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when simple "and" would suffice, don't use when equal emphasis is needed (use "and"), can create subject-verb agreement confusion (verb agrees with first subject, not added elements), not ideal when long lists need clear parallel structure.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - X as well as Y (standard form)
   - not only X but Y as well (related construction with different emphasis)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "as well" (equally, also) + "as" (comparison) to create additive conjunction. The phrase evolved to add elements while maintaining focus on the primary element mentioned first. More formal and emphatic than simple "and."
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (comparison) + well (satisfactorily, equally) + as (comparison)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I play guitar as well as piano.
   - She's smart as well as funny.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study examines quantitative as well as qualitative data.
   - The policy affects employees as well as contractors and consultants.

1. **Expression**: as soon as (type: subordinating conjunction phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Immediately when; at the moment that; right after. Used to indicate that one action will occur immediately following another without delay.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (all three words required)
   
   **Synonyms**: immediately when, the moment that, right after, once, when (less emphatic)
   
   **Antonyms**: long after, eventually after, some time after
   
   **When to Use**: Use to emphasize immediacy or lack of delay between actions, in instructions or promises, when timing is important, to show promptness or urgency, across all formality levels, in both past and future contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when delay or gap exists between actions, don't use when "when" alone is sufficient without emphasis on immediacy, inappropriate when sequence isn't immediately consecutive.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Just as soon as (adds extra emphasis)
   - As soon as possible (ASAP - indicating desired speed)
   - As soon as [subject] can (modal added for ability/possibility)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "as soon" (degree of quickness) + "as" (temporal conjunction) to create expression emphasizing immediate succession. The double "as" follows English comparison patterns ("as X as") but specialized for temporal immediacy.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (degree) + soon (quickly, in near future) + as (temporal conjunction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Call me as soon as you get home.
   - I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee will convene as soon as the report is finalized.
   - Participants were debriefed as soon as the experimental session concluded.

1. **Expression**: as far as (type: prepositional phrase / discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Extent)* To the degree or extent that; concerning the scope or range of something.
   - *(Knowledge)* In my/your knowledge or understanding; to the best of one's knowledge.
   - *Fixedness*: strong in fixed phrases, medium in general use
   
   **Synonyms**: to the extent that (extent), concerning (scope), in my knowledge (epistemic), regarding (scope)
   
   **Antonyms**: beyond, outside the scope of
   
   **When to Use**: Use to indicate limits of knowledge or scope, in phrases like "as far as I know" or "as far as I'm concerned," when discussing extent or boundaries, to qualify statements, appropriate across registers but particularly common in spoken English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when definitive rather than qualified knowledge is available, don't use to indicate physical distance (use "as far as" with locations differently), not appropriate when unlimited scope is meant.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - As far as I know (epistemic qualifier - very common)
   - As far as I'm concerned (opinion marker)
   - As far as [topic] goes (scope marker)
   - As far as I can tell (epistemic hedge)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "as far" (to what extent/distance) + "as" (comparison/limit) to create phrase marking boundaries of knowledge, scope, or extent. The construction parallels physical distance expressions but extended to abstract domains.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (to the degree) + far (distance, extent) + as (comparative)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As far as I know, the meeting's at three.
   - As far as I'm concerned, you can do whatever you want.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - As far as the research indicates, no significant correlation exists.
   - As far as the current data extend, this hypothesis appears valid.

1. **Expression**: as such (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In the exact sense of the word; in that precise capacity; therefore or consequently (as a result of being what was just described).
   - *Fixedness*: strong (two words must appear together)
   
   **Synonyms**: therefore, consequently, in that capacity, per se, in itself, accordingly
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless (showing contrast rather than consequence)
   
   **When to Use**: Use to refer back to something just mentioned and draw conclusions, when clarifying that something is being considered in its proper category, in formal or academic writing, when emphasizing consequences of a previously mentioned quality or status.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where simpler language works, don't use when no prior reference exists (needs antecedent), inappropriate when contrast rather than consequence is meant, can sound overly formal in everyday contexts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - And as such (adds connective)
   - Being as such (emphasizes state)
   - Treated as such (emphasizes how something is handled)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "as" (in the capacity/manner of) + "such" (of that kind/type) to create anaphoric phrase referring to previously mentioned status/quality and drawing implications. Common in formal discourse for logical coherence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the manner of) + such (of that type/kind)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He's the boss, and as such, he makes the decisions.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The data are preliminary and as such should be interpreted with caution.
   - This constitutes a significant finding and as such warrants further investigation.

1. **Expression**: wait for (type: phrasal verb / verb + preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To stay in a place or delay action until someone arrives or something happens; to remain ready or expectant for something or someone.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (verb must be followed by "for" with this meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: await (formal), stay for, hold on for, expect
   
   **Antonyms**: leave without, proceed without, abandon
   
   **When to Use**: Use when indicating anticipation or delayed action until something occurs, with objects referring to people or events, across all formality levels, very common in everyday speech, in requests and instructions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't drop "for" when object is present (incorrect: "wait me"), avoid in very formal contexts where "await" might be preferred, don't confuse with "wait on" (serve someone) which has different meaning.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Wait for [someone/something]
   - Can't wait for [something] (eagerness)
   - Worth waiting for (evaluation)
   - Keep waiting for (ongoing anticipation)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Wait" (delay action) requires "for" to introduce the object being awaited. This is a dependent preposition - "for" is grammatically required with this verb when an object follows. The preposition marks the anticipated event or person.
   
   **Root Analysis**: wait (Old English "wætan" - watch, observe) + for (concerning, toward)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Wait for me! I'm coming!
   - I've been waiting for you for like an hour.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were instructed to wait for the signal before responding.
   - We shall wait for the committee's decision before proceeding.

1. **Expression**: prepare for (type: phrasal verb / verb + preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To make ready or get ready for a future event, situation, or requirement; to make necessary arrangements or take steps in advance.

   **Synonyms**: get ready for, make preparations for, plan for, arrange for, gear up for
   
   **Antonyms**: neglect, be unprepared for, ignore
   
   **When to Use**: Use when discussing advance planning or readiness, with objects indicating future events or situations, in instructions and advice, across all formality levels, in contexts emphasizing foresight and planning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when preparation is complete (use "prepared" instead), avoid when action is spontaneous rather than planned, don't confuse "prepare for" (get ready for) with "prepare [object]" (make something ready).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Prepare for [event/situation]
   - Well-prepared for (completed state)
   - Prepare oneself for (reflexive, often for difficult situations)
   - Prepare in advance for (redundant but emphatic)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Prepare" (make ready) requires "for" to introduce what one is getting ready for. Dependent preposition relationship where "for" marks the future event or situation that requires preparation. The preposition carries future-oriented meaning.
   
   **Root Analysis**: prepare (pre- before + -pare make ready) + for (toward, in anticipation of)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I need to prepare for my interview tomorrow.
   - Are you guys prepared for the exam?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Institutions must prepare for potential disruptions to ensure continuity.
   - Participants were asked to prepare for the assessment by reviewing relevant materials.

1. **Expression**: suitable for / appropriate for (type: adjective + preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Having the necessary qualities or characteristics to be right, proper, or fitting for a particular purpose, person, or situation.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (these adjectives require "for" to introduce purpose/person)
   
   **Synonyms**: right for, fitting for, proper for, apt for, adequate for
   
   **Antonyms**: unsuitable for, inappropriate for, unfit for, wrong for
   
   **When to Use**: Use when evaluating fitness or appropriateness, in recommendations and descriptions, when matching things to purposes or people, in product descriptions, educational contexts, professional evaluations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when something is merely acceptable but not ideal, don't use when perfection is meant (use "ideal for" or "perfect for"), too formal for very casual descriptions where "good for" works.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Particularly suitable/appropriate for (adds emphasis)
   - Not suitable/appropriate for (negative warning)
   - Well-suited for (informal variant)
   - Highly appropriate for (emphasizes strong fit)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: These evaluative adjectives require "for" to introduce the purpose, person, or situation being evaluated. Dependent preposition where "for" marks what the appropriateness is being assessed in relation to. Standard pattern in English for fitness evaluation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: suitable (suit + -able) / appropriate (ad- toward + proprius own) + for (concerning, in relation to)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This movie isn't suitable for young kids.
   - These hiking boots are perfect for beginners.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The methodology is appropriate for addressing the research questions posed.
   - This curriculum is particularly suitable for adult learners with prior experience.

1. **Expression**: as a result (type: discourse marker / transitional phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Because of something mentioned previously; consequently; therefore. Used to introduce the outcome or consequence of a previously stated cause or situation.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (all words must appear together in this order)
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, therefore, thus, accordingly, hence
   
   **Antonyms**: despite this, nevertheless, however (showing contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: Use at the beginning of sentences or clauses to show cause-effect relationships, in academic and formal writing, when making logical connections explicit, to organize arguments or narratives, appropriate in formal contexts but understandable in casual.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "so" is simpler, don't use when contrast rather than consequence is intended, inappropriate when no clear causal relationship exists, can sound overly formal in everyday speech.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - As a result of [specific cause] (extends to identify cause explicitly)
   - And as a result (adds connective)
   - As a direct result (emphasizes strong causation)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The phrase "as a result" combines "as" (in the capacity of) + "a result" (an outcome/consequence) to create a fixed transitional expression marking causal relationships. It explicitly signals that what follows is a consequence of what preceded. Common in academic and formal discourse for logical organization.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the manner of) + result (from Latin "resultare" - to rebound, spring back)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Less common casually; would use "so" instead: "It rained, so we stayed home")
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Funding was reduced significantly. As a result, several programs were discontinued.
   - The intervention proved ineffective. As a result, alternative approaches are being considered.
