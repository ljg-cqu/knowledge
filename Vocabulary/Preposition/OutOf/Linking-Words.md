1. **Linking Word**: out of (type: compound preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates source, origin, or cause; used to show what something comes from or is made from
   - *Function*: Shows causal or source relationship between two elements; can indicate material, motivation, or derivation
   
   **Synonyms**: from (in context of origin), because of (in context of cause), due to (in context of reason)
   
   **Antonyms**: into, toward, to
   
   **When to Use**: Use "out of" to express origin, source material, causation, or motivation. Common in explanations of how something came to be or why something happened. Appropriate for showing material composition or emotional/psychological motivation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid redundancy with verbs that already contain the meaning of "out" (e.g., "exit out of" should be "exit from" or just "exit"). Don't use when simple "from" would be clearer and less wordy in formal writing.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Result/Action] + out of + [Cause/Source/Material]
   - **Position**: Typically follows the main clause, connecting cause to effect
   - **Punctuation**: No comma needed when "out of" introduces a brief prepositional phrase; comma may precede if it introduces a longer explanatory element
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Confusing "out of" (indicating source/cause) with "outside of" (indicating physical location); using "out from" when "out of" is correct
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from inside) + of (indicating source or origin)
