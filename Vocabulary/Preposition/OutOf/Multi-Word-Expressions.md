   **Antonyms**: as expected, predictably, according to plan, foreseeably
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing surprising events, unexpected contacts, or unforeseen occurrences. Appropriate in both casual and semi-formal contexts. Effective for emphasizing the surprising nature of events.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing (use "unexpectedly" instead). Don't use when events were actually somewhat predictable. Not appropriate when discussing planned surprises.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - right out of the blue (emphasizes unexpectedness)
   - completely out of the blue (intensifies surprise)
   - came out of the blue (past tense form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The phrase derives from the concept of lightning striking from a clear blue sky—something dramatic happening without any warning clouds or storm signs. The metaphorical "blue" represents calm, clear conditions where nothing is expected to happen. First recorded use in the late 19th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (from) + of + the + blue (clear sky, Old English blǣwen)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My ex texted me out of the blue after five years of silence.
   - Out of the blue, they offered me the job—I wasn't even expecting a callback.

   **When to Use**: Use when firmly rejecting possibilities or proposals. Appropriate for expressing that something absolutely cannot happen. Common in decision-making and negotiation contexts, both casual and formal.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when some possibility exists (too absolute). Don't use when you need to soften rejection or keep options open. Can sound harsh if not accompanied by explanation or alternative.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - completely out of the question (intensifies impossibility)
   - absolutely out of the question (adds emphasis)
   - that's out of the question (demonstrative form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The "question" refers to matters under consideration or discussion. Something "out of" this question is beyond the bounds of what's being debated—so far outside consideration as to be impossible. The phrase emphasizes removal from discussion entirely. Used since at least the 18th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (beyond) + of + the + question (Latin quaestio, inquiry)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Going to Vegas for spring break? That's out of the question—I'm broke.
   - Having pets in this apartment is out of the question according to the lease.

   **When to Use**: Use when criticizing behavior that violates norms or expectations. Appropriate for calling out inappropriate comments, actions, or demands. Common in workplace and social contexts for setting boundaries.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal contexts (use "inappropriate" instead). Don't use when gentle correction is needed (too confrontational). Not appropriate without specifying why behavior is problematic.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - way out of line (emphasizes severity)
   - totally out of line (intensifies criticism)
   - that was out of line (past tense reference)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The metaphor comes from military or formation contexts where soldiers must stay in line. Being "out of line" means breaking formation—violating the expected order. Extended metaphorically to social and professional behavior. The spatial metaphor of boundaries is very effective for social norms.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (outside) + of + line (Latin linea, string/boundary)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That comment about her weight was totally out of line, dude.
   - You were out of line yelling at the waiter like that.

1. **Expression**: out of touch (type: collocation)

   **Antonyms**: in touch, aware, informed, connected, up to date
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing lack of awareness about current situations, popular culture, or people's realities. Appropriate for criticism of disconnected leadership or outdated understanding. Common in social and political commentary.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when describing temporary communication lapses (use "lost touch" instead). Don't use judgmentally without recognizing valid reasons for limited awareness. Not appropriate for minor knowledge gaps.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - completely out of touch (emphasizes disconnection)
   - out of touch with reality (specific form criticizing unrealistic views)
   - grown out of touch (emphasizes gradual process)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Touch" metaphorically represents connection and awareness, as physical touch maintains connection. Being "out of" this touch means losing that connection—whether to people, current events, or reality. The tactile metaphor powerfully conveys disconnect. The collocation is semantically transparent and highly conventional.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (outside) + of + touch (Old English tǣcan, to touch)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My dad is so out of touch—he still thinks Facebook is what kids use.
   - I'm totally out of touch with popular music these days.

   **When to Use**: Use when describing situations, behaviors, or conditions that have exceeded manageable limits. Appropriate for describing chaos, addiction, unrestrained growth, or escalating problems. Common in crisis descriptions and warnings.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exaggerating manageable situations. Don't use when "challenging" or "difficult" would be more accurate. Not appropriate when undermining others' capable management.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - completely out of control (emphasizes severity)
   - spinning out of control (adds motion imagery)
   - gotten out of control (emphasizes process of losing control)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Control" represents the ability to direct or restrain. Being "out of" control means beyond the reach of controlling mechanisms—like something escaping one's grasp. The spatial metaphor of being outside the bounds of control is highly conventional. Very frequent collocation in English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (beyond) + of + control (Medieval Latin contrarotulus, register/means of restraint)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The party got totally out of control after midnight.
   - My spending has been out of control lately—I need to budget.

   **When to Use**: Use for equipment or systems that aren't functioning (sense 1), or for procedural violations in formal contexts (sense 2). Appropriate for signage, technical descriptions, or parliamentary procedure. Common in maintenance and formal meeting contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid ambiguity—clarify which sense you mean. Don't use "out of order" for behavior in casual contexts (use "out of line" instead for sense 2). Not appropriate when "broken" would be clearer.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - temporarily out of order (emphasizes temporary state)
   - completely out of order (intensifies for sense 1 or sense 2)
   - ruled out of order (specific to parliamentary procedure)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Order" represents both proper functioning and correct sequence/procedure. Being "out of" this order means failing to function correctly or violating proper procedures. The dual meanings share the concept of deviation from proper state. Very conventional collocation with clear semantic structure.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + order (Latin ordo, arrangement/sequence)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The elevator's out of order again—we'll have to take the stairs.

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when making people feel unwelcome (can be hurtful). Don't use to criticize others' choices without tact. Not appropriate when diversity is valuable and "different" doesn't mean "wrong."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - totally out of place (emphasizes unsuitability)
   - feel out of place (personal experience version)
   - look out of place (visual assessment)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Place" represents appropriate position or setting. Being "out of" one's place means not fitting the expected position—physically, socially, or contextually. The spatial metaphor extends effectively to social belonging. Very conventional and semantically transparent collocation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + place (Latin platea, open space/position)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I felt totally out of place at that fancy gala in my jeans.
   - A modern sculpture would look out of place in that historic building.

   **Antonyms**: after consideration, under control, manageable
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing situations that have become unmanageable (sense 2 primary modern use) or immediate rejections without deliberation. Appropriate for describing escalating problems or swift dismissals.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid confusing with "at hand" (nearby) or "on hand" (available). Don't use ambiguously when "out of control" or "immediately" would be clearer.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - get out of hand (become unmanageable)
   - dismiss out of hand (reject immediately)
   - reject out of hand (refuse without consideration)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Hand" represents control and management (as hands control things). Something "out of" one's hand is beyond one's ability to control or has escaped one's grasp. The phrase evolved from the sense of immediate action (from the hand directly) to uncontrolled situations. Historical idiom dating to medieval times.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (beyond) + of + hand (Old English hand, the hand)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The argument got out of hand and turned into a shouting match.
   - He dismissed my suggestion out of hand without even thinking about it.

   **When to Use**: Use when describing situations where someone cannot get what they want due to circumstances beyond control. Appropriate for expressing mild disappointment about unavailability or missed opportunities. Common in customer service and everyday disappointments.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for serious hardships (too casual). Don't use unsympathetically about others' genuine misfortunes. Not appropriate when you can actually still help or provide alternatives.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - totally out of luck (emphasizes completeness)
   - completely out of luck (intensifies)
   - you're out of luck (direct address form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Luck" is conceptualized as a resource or commodity one can have or lack. Being "out of" luck is like being out of any resource—depleted, unavailable. The metaphor treats luck as finite and exhaustible. The expression emphasizes circumstantial rather than self-caused problems.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (depleted of) + of + luck (Middle Dutch luc, happiness/good fortune)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Looking for tickets? You're out of luck—the concert's sold out.
   - If you wanted chocolate cake, you're out of luck—we only have vanilla left.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Applicants who missed the deadline are unfortunately out of luck.
   - Those seeking accommodation at this late date are out of luck as all venues are booked.

1. **Expression**: out of pocket (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Having paid money from one's own resources (rather than being reimbursed); unavailable or unreachable (British usage)

   **Synonyms**: paying personally, self-funded, unreimbursed (for financial sense); unavailable, unreachable (for British sense)
   
   **Antonyms**: reimbursed, covered, paid for (for financial sense); available, reachable (for British sense)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing personal financial expenditure that isn't reimbursed (American sense) or being unavailable for contact (British sense). Appropriate in business expense contexts or availability discussions. Context must clarify which meaning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid without context clarifying which meaning (American vs. British). Don't use when "unreimbursed" would be clearer in financial contexts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - out-of-pocket expenses (financial costs paid personally)
   - out-of-pocket costs (unreimbursed expenditures)
   - be out of pocket (British: unavailable)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The "pocket" represents one's personal money supply. Money that comes "out of" one's pocket is one's own expense. The British sense of being unavailable may derive from the idea of being away from one's usual position (as money leaves the pocket). American and British usages have diverged significantly.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (from) + of + pocket (Anglo-Norman poket, small bag)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was out of pocket $200 for the car repair since insurance didn't cover it.
   - Sorry I missed your calls—I was out of pocket all afternoon. (British)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Employees will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred during business travel.

1. **Expression**: out of sight, out of mind (type: proverb/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - When something or someone is not visible or present, they are easily forgotten; absence leads to forgetting
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed proverb, often shortened to "out of sight")
   
   **Synonyms**: easily forgotten when absent, forgotten when not present, absence causes forgetting
   
   **Antonyms**: absence makes the heart grow fonder, constantly remembered
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing how people or things are forgotten when not regularly seen or present. Appropriate for discussing memory, relationships, marketing visibility, or psychological phenomena. Common in both casual and formal contexts as a recognized proverb.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when describing strong bonds that persist despite absence. Don't use cynically about relationships where distance actually strengthens connection.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - out of sight, out of mind (full proverb form)
   - it's out of sight, out of mind (statement form)
   - out of sight is out of mind (variant phrasing)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: This ancient proverb uses parallel structure and rhyme to make it memorable. The logic: visibility maintains mental presence; absence of visual input leads to forgetting. The spatial metaphor (sight) stands for all forms of presence and attention. Used in English since at least the 13th century, likely translating earlier Latin sayings.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + sight (Old English sihþ, seeing) + out of mind (Old English gemynd, memory)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - With him studying abroad, it's kind of out of sight, out of mind—we barely talk anymore.
   - If I don't see the cookies on the counter, out of sight, out of mind—I won't eat them.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization maintains regular communication with members to avoid the "out of sight, out of mind" phenomenon.
   - Brand visibility is crucial in marketing; out of sight truly means out of mind for consumers.

   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiom)

   **Antonyms**: feeling great, in good spirits, well, cheerful
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing mild physical or emotional discomfort that affects mood. Appropriate for explaining below-par performance or irritability. Common in British English; less common in American English but understood.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for serious illness (too mild). Don't use for severe emotional distress. Not appropriate for major health concerns requiring medical terminology.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - feeling out of sorts (experiential form)
   - a bit out of sorts (downplays severity)
   - rather out of sorts (British understatement)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Sorts" historically referred to one's usual condition or type. Being "out of" one's sorts means not in one's normal state—slightly off from usual form. The phrase suggests mild deviation from baseline rather than serious problem. British idiom dating to at least the 17th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + sorts (Old French sorte, kind/type/condition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm feeling a bit out of sorts today—might be coming down with something.
   - He's been out of sorts all week since the bad news.

   **Synonyms**: in over one's head, beyond one's abilities, out of one's league, overwhelmed
   
   **Antonyms**: in one's element, within one's capabilities, competent, capable
   
   **When to Use**: Use when acknowledging or describing situations where someone lacks the necessary skills or knowledge. Appropriate for self-aware admissions or assessments of mismatch between challenge and capability. Common in professional and educational contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when criticizing others insensitively. Don't use to discourage people from growth challenges. Not appropriate without offering support or alternatives.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - completely out of one's depth (emphasizes severity)
   - totally out of my depth (personal admission)
   - getting out of one's depth (progressive sense)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Swimming metaphor: when water exceeds one's height, one can no longer stand safely and is at risk of drowning. Extended metaphorically to any situation where demands exceed capabilities—one "can't touch bottom" or find secure footing. Powerfully conveys overwhelming challenge. British idiom from 19th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (beyond) + of + one's + depth (Old English dēop, deep + -th)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - Figurative/Idiomatic meaning: Safe from danger or past critical phase
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiom, often used in negative "not out of the woods yet")
   
   **Synonyms**: safe, past danger, in the clear, recovered, through the worst
   
   **Antonyms**: in danger, at risk, in trouble, facing difficulties
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing recovery from serious problems, often medical or financial. Frequently used in negative form to warn that danger persists despite improvement. Appropriate in medical, business crisis, and serious problem contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for minor problems (too dramatic). Don't use prematurely before actual safety is established. Not appropriate for ongoing chronic situations without crisis phase.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - not out of the woods yet (common negative form)
   - finally out of the woods (emphasizes relief)
   - far from out of the woods (emphasizes continuing danger)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Forests historically represented danger—bandits, wild animals, getting lost. Emerging "out of the woods" meant reaching safety and civilization. The metaphor extends to any situation where one passes from danger to safety. Very old idiom, found in various European languages with similar structure.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + the + woods (Old English wudu, forest)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The patient's improving, but she's not out of the woods yet.
   - Our financial situation is better, but we're not out of the woods.

1. **Expression**: out of one's mind (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Insane, irrational, or making very poor decisions; unable to think clearly
   - *(Sense 2)* Extremely worried or anxious (usually with "worried out of one's mind")
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed idiom)
   
   **Synonyms**: crazy, insane, irrational, mad, not thinking clearly
   
   **Antonyms**: sane, rational, sensible, in one's right mind
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing extremely irrational behavior or decisions, or extreme worry. Can be used seriously or humorously depending on context. Common in both critical assessments and exaggerated expressions of anxiety.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when discussing actual mental health issues (insensitive). Don't use clinically about psychological conditions. Not appropriate in formal contexts where "irrational" would be better.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - completely out of one's mind (intensifies)
   - worried out of one's mind (specific anxiety usage)
   - bored out of one's mind (extreme boredom)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Mind" represents rational thought and sanity. Being "out of" one's mind means one's rational faculties have departed—one is no longer in possession of sound judgment. The spatial metaphor treats the mind as a container from which sanity can exit. Very common idiom across English-speaking regions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: out (away from) + of + one's + mind (Old English gemynd, thought/memory)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
