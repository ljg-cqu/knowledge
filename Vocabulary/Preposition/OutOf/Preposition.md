1. **Preposition**: out of (type: compound)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Moving from the inside to the outside of something; from within to beyond
   - *(Temporal)* Beyond or outside a particular time period
   - *(Abstract)* Indicating source, origin, cause, material, or motivation; lacking or depleted of something
   
   **Synonyms**: from (in context of origin), beyond (in context of limits), without (in context of lacking), because of (in context of motivation)
   
   **Antonyms**: into, within, inside of, toward
   
   **When to Use**: Use "out of" to indicate movement from inside to outside, derivation from a source, composition from materials, motivation or cause, or depletion of resources. Essential for expressing origin, causation, and exhaustion.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid redundancy with verbs already containing "out" meaning (e.g., "exit out of" should be "exit from" or just "exit"). Don't use when simple "from" would be clearer in formal writing. L1 interference: speakers of languages without spatial prepositions may confuse "out of" with "from" or "outside."
