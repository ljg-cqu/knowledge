**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one adjective with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, and examples across registers, with special attention to how these adjectives relate to "on" constructions.

- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact adjectives)
- Do not skip sections; cover both common and specialized descriptive vocabulary related to "on" usage
