# Extract Functional Language for Vocabulary Learning: "On"

**Task**: Extract functional language expressions and speech acts involving the preposition "**on**" that are essential for pragmatic communication and social interaction from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one functional expression or speech act pattern involving "on" with comprehensive learning information including pragmatic function, usage context, formality level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all functional expressions with "on" that perform specific communicative actions
- Prioritize: requesting/suggesting/refusing with "on", agreeing/disagreeing on topics, expressing opinions on subjects, discussing dependencies/conditions with "on"
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency social interactions involving "on")
- Do not skip sections; cover both direct and indirect speech acts using "on"

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in functional expressions with "on" actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard pragmatic descriptions

**Focus:**
- Requesting and asking with "on" (Could you update me on...?, Can I count on...?, I need your input on...)
- Suggesting and recommending on topics (What do you think about focusing on...?, Let's agree on...)
- Agreeing and disagreeing on subjects (I agree with you on that, I'm not sure I'm on board with...)
- Expressing opinions on topics (My take on this is..., From my perspective on..., I'm keen on...)
- Discussing dependencies (This depends on..., Based on..., Contingent on...)
- Clarifying and checking understanding on topics (Just to clarify on..., Are we on the same page?)
- Commenting on timing/schedules (We're on schedule, On Monday, On time, On deadline)
- Discussing states/conditions (On purpose, On fire, On track, On hold)
