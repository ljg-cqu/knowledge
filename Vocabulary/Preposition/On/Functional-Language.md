   **When to Use**: Meetings, discussions, consultations, collaborative work. Use when seeking input from colleagues, experts, or stakeholders. Appropriate for equal or slightly subordinate relationships.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for close friends (use "What do you think about...?"). May sound indirect when decisive action is needed.
