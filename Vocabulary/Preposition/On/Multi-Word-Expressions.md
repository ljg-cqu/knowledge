   **Common Variations**: 
   - right on time (emphatic)
   - exactly on time
   - always on time
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "On" suggests focus/direction of intent; "purpose" as the goal or intention. The combination creates a strong collocation meaning intentionality.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - on the one hand... on the other hand (paired construction)
   - but on the other hand
   - then again / then on the other hand
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Metaphorical extension of physical hands representing two sides of an argument or two options being "weighed" or "held" for comparison. Ancient rhetorical device visualizing balanced judgment.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "on" + "the" + "other" + "hand" (Old English "hand" = physical hand, extended to mean "side" or "aspect")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The apartment is expensive. On the other hand, it's in a perfect location.
   - I want to go out tonight, but on the other hand, I'm really tired.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - be on fire
   - set something on fire (literal)
   - catch on fire (literal)
   - absolutely on fire (emphatic figurative)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The metaphor of fire represents intensity, energy, and uncontrollable power. Extended to describe peak performance and excitement. The phrase dates to Middle English but figurative use became common in 20th century, particularly in sports.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "on" (Old English) + "fire" (Old English "fyr")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - rely heavily on
   - depend entirely on
   - can rely on / can depend on
   - relied on (past tense)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Rely" and "depend" require "on" due to the metaphorical sense of being "positioned on" or "supported by" something/someone. The preposition "on" conveys the idea of weight, support, and foundation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "rely" (Latin "religare" = bind fast) + "on"; "depend" (Latin "dependere" = hang from) + "on"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I rely on my morning coffee to wake me up.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - focus entirely on
   - concentrate fully on
   - need to focus on
   - be focused on / be concentrated on
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Focus" derives from Latin "focus" (hearth, fireplace) metaphorically meaning "center point." "On" indicates the target or surface where attention is directed. "Concentrate" similarly requires "on" to indicate the point of convergence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "focus" (Latin "focus" = hearth) + "on"; "concentrate" (Latin "con-" + "centrum" = center) + "on"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I can't focus on work when there's so much noise around me.

   - is based on
   - based largely on
   - based entirely on
   - based on the fact that
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Base" as a noun means foundation or bottom support. The past participle "based" combined with "on" creates the sense of something being positioned/founded on a particular support or evidence. Extremely productive in English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "base" (Greek "basis" through Latin and French) + "on"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - on behalf of [person/organization]
   - on someone's behalf
   - acting on behalf of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Behalf" is a compound of "by" + "half" (side), originally meaning "by the side of." "On behalf of" developed to mean "on the side of" or "in the interest of." Exclusively used in this fixed phrase in modern English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "on" + "behalf" (Middle English "bihalve" = by the side of)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm calling on behalf of my grandmother to ask about her prescription.
   - Can you accept this award on my behalf? I can't make it to the ceremony.

   - on the brink of disaster/collapse/war/extinction
   - on the verge of tears/breakthrough/bankruptcy
   - teetering on the brink
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Brink" and "verge" both mean "edge" or "border." The phrases metaphorically position someone/something at the edge of a cliff or boundary, about to fall over or cross into a new state. Historical use in literature and journalism.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "on" + "brink" (Middle English, possibly Scandinavian origin) / "on" + "verge" (Latin "virga" = rod, stripe, through French)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was on the verge of tears when I heard the news about my acceptance.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - really gets on my nerves
   - starting to get on my nerves
   - got on everyone's nerves
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The expression dates to the 19th century when "nerves" became associated with emotional sensitivity and irritability. The metaphor suggests something is physically touching or pressing on one's nervous system, causing discomfort. "On" emphasizes the direct contact/pressure aspect.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "get" + "on" + "someone's" + "nerves" (Latin "nervus" = sinew, tendon, later extended to nervous system)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That constant tapping noise is really getting on my nerves!
