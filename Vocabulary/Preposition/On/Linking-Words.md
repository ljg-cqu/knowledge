1. **Linking Word**: on the other hand (type: discourse marker - contrast)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a contrasting point, alternative perspective, or different aspect of an argument; signals shift to an opposing or alternative viewpoint

   **Synonyms**: conversely, however, in contrast, by contrast, alternatively, whereas
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, in the same way, by the same token, correspondingly
   
   **When to Use**: Essential in argumentative and analytical writing/speech when presenting balanced arguments. Use to acknowledge counterpoints, compare alternatives, or show multiple perspectives. Very common in academic and professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using without establishing the first "hand" (initial point). Can sound overly formal in casual conversation. Don't overuse—one or two times per essay/presentation.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial, set off by commas
   - [Punctuation]: "On the other hand, [contrasting statement]." OR "[Statement]. On the other hand, [contrast]."
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without establishing first point; overuse leading to wishy-washy argumentation
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (preposition) + the + other + hand (Old English "hand" = physical hand, extended to "side" or "aspect")
   
   **Etymology**: Ancient rhetorical device dating to classical oratory. The metaphor visualizes weighing two sides of an argument as if holding objects in two hands for comparison. Formalized in English writing by 1700s.

   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound formulaic if overused. May be too formal for casual writing. Avoid when position is clearly one-sided—this structure suggests equivalence.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Structure]: "On the one hand, [Statement A]. On the other hand, [Contrasting Statement B]."
   - [Position]: Both phrases typically sentence-initial or clause-initial
   - [Punctuation]: Usually separate sentences or independent clauses
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "on the other hand" without "on the one hand"; creating false equivalence between unequal arguments
   
   **Root Analysis**: Paired construction using "one" and "other" with "hand" metaphor
   
   **Etymology**: Classical rhetorical device formalized in English academic writing. Visualizes systematic weighing of two alternatives as if balancing objects in two hands. Standard in argumentative discourse since 1800s.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or mid-sentence: "Based on X, Y" or "Y, based on X"
   - [Structure]: "Based on [evidence/criteria], [conclusion/decision]"
   - [Punctuation]: "Based on the data, we conclude..." OR "The decision, based on committee recommendations, was..."
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without clearly specifying the basis; claiming causation when only correlation exists
   
   **Root Analysis**: base (Greek "basis" = foundation) + -ed + on
   
   **Etymology**: "Base" (foundation) → past participle "based" + "on" (indicating support). Became standard in academic and professional writing by 1900s as evidence-based reasoning gained prominence.

   - [Punctuation]: "Depending on circumstances, the policy may apply." OR "The outcome varies depending on multiple factors."
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Not clearly specifying what depends on what; using when no actual dependency exists
   
   **Root Analysis**: depend (Latin "dependere" = hang from) + -ing + on
   
   **Etymology**: "Depend" (hang from, rely on) → present participle "depending" + "on". Became standard for expressing conditional relationships in technical and academic English.
