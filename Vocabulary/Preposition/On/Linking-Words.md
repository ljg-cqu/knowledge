# Extract Linking Words & Discourse Markers for Vocabulary Learning: "On"

**Task**: Extract linking words (conjunctions, connectors, discourse markers, transition expressions) involving or commonly used with the preposition "**on**" that are essential for constructing complex sentences and expressing logical relationships from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one linking word or discourse marker involving "on" with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, grammatical function, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all linking words/connectors that involve "on" or connect clauses, phrases, words, or ideas in "on" contexts
- Prioritize: conditional phrases with "on" (on condition that, on the assumption that), discourse markers signaling "on" relationships, transition phrases involving "on"
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact linking expressions with "on")
- Do not skip sections; cover both grammatical conjunctions and discourse-level connectors involving "on"

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in linking words with "on" actually present in source
- Never invent linking words not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- **Conditional connectors with "on"** (on the condition that, on the basis that, on the understanding that)
- **Causal/basis markers** (on account of, on the grounds that, based on, depending on)
- **Temporal markers** (on [day], on [occasion], on arrival, on completion)
- **Sequential markers** (building on, following on from, moving on)
- **Additive markers** (on top of that, on another note)
- **Referential markers** (on this point, on the matter of, on the subject of)
- **Discourse shifters** (on second thought, on reflection, on balance)
- **Cohesive devices with "on"** (reference markers, continuation signals)

**Format:**
- **Linking Word**: [word/phrase with "on"] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative/connector/discourse marker)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain grammatical or discourse function clearly*
  - *Describe logical relationship created by "on" construction*
  - *Include clause patterns and register information*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative linking words with same function
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 linking words expressing opposite logical relationship (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or registers where this "on" linking word is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this linking word would be inappropriate or create grammatical/logical errors
- **Common Patterns**: Grammatical structures, punctuation rules, sentence positions for "on" expressions
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (if applicable)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

1. **Linking Word**: [word/phrase with "on"] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative/connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - [Collins-style definition]
   - *Function*: [grammatical/discourse function and logical relationship with "on"]
   
   **Synonyms**: [word1], [word2], [word3]...
   
   **Antonyms**: [opposite-function word1], [word2]... (if applicable)

   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - grammatical errors, wrong logical relationship, incorrect register, overuse]
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [clause/phrase] + [linking word with "on"] + [clause/phrase]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial / mid-sentence / sentence-final

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on linking words with "on" that are essential for complex sentences and coherent communication
- Prioritize linking words with learning value (subordinating conjunctions with "on", formal connectors, subtle distinctions)
- Clearly indicate grammatical patterns, punctuation rules, and register restrictions for "on" expressions
- Distinguish between grammatical conjunctions (sentence-level) and discourse markers (text-level) involving "on"
- Highlight how "on" contributes to the logical relationship being expressed
