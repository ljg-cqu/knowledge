# Extract Verbs for Vocabulary Learning: "On"

**Task**: Extract verbs (action words, phrasal verbs, verb phrases) that are essential for language mastery and commonly used with or in contexts involving the preposition "**on**" from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one verb or phrasal verb involving "on" with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, antonyms, etymology, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all verbs that are decision-critical for understanding the text, especially those that require or commonly use "on"
- Prioritize: verbs requiring "on" (focus on, rely on), phrasal verbs with "on" (carry on, go on, turn on), and verbs describing actions involving "on" relationships
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency and high-impact verbs with "on")
- Do not skip sections; cover both dependent preposition verbs and phrasal verbs with "on"
