1. **Linking Word**: whereas (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a contrast or comparison between two facts or situations; while on the contrary; in contrast with the fact that.
   - *Function*: Contrasts two things, often in terms of relative worth or value; shows how two situations differ
   
   **Synonyms**: while, but, in contrast, on the other hand, although
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, equally, just as
   
   **When to Use**: When comparing worth or value of two things; in formal writing establishing contrasts; in contexts where precise contrast between comparable items is needed; especially common in worth comparisons ("X is worth Y, whereas Z is worth W").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual speech where "but" or "while" is more natural; when simple "but" suffices without formal contrast implication; when "although" (concession) vs. "whereas" (contrast) is more appropriate.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about worth of X], whereas [Statement about worth of Y]
   - [Position]: sentence-medial, separating contrasting clauses
   - [Punctuation]: comma before "whereas" when mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use at sentence start; don't confuse contrast with concession
   
   **Root Analysis**: where (in which place/case) + as (to the extent that)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "where" + "as" → compound conjunction expressing contrast
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The basic model is worth about $50, whereas the premium version is worth $200.
   - This one's worth keeping, whereas that one is basically worthless.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Traditional methods are worth consideration in stable markets, whereas innovative approaches are worth pursuing in volatile conditions.
   - The tangible benefits are worth approximately $1 million, whereas intangible benefits are worth considerably more.

1. **Linking Word**: while (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - During the time that; at the same time as; although; despite the fact that; in contrast (especially when comparing worth).
   - *Function*: Can show simultaneous action, concession, or contrast in value/worth
   
   **Synonyms**: whereas, although, as, when, whilst (British)
   
   **Antonyms**: (context-dependent)
   
   **When to Use**: When comparing relative worth with contrast implication; when showing concurrent value assessments; more flexible and less formal than "whereas"; appropriate in both casual and formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "whereas" provides needed formality and precision; when temporal "while" (during) might be confused with contrastive "while"; when "although" (concession) is clearer than "while" (contrast).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth statement 1] while [Worth statement 2]
   - [Position]: can be sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma after introductory "while" clause; comma before mid-sentence "while"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Ambiguity between temporal and contrastive meanings
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (Old English "hwīl" - period of time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwīl" (time) → developed contrastive meaning by Middle English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The basic plan is worth $10/month while the premium is worth $50/month.
   - While this one's worth something, that one's basically junk.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: nevertheless, nonetheless, yet, still, though
   
   **Antonyms**: moreover, furthermore, additionally, also
   
   **When to Use**: When qualifying or contrasting worth statements; when introducing exceptions to value assessments; when pivoting from one valuation to another; appropriate in formal and semi-formal contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual speech where "but" or "though" is more natural; when over-formal tone is inappropriate; when causal "therefore" vs. contrastive "however" is needed.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth statement 1]. However, [contrasting worth statement 2]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), mid-sentence, or sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: semicolon before or period, comma after sentence-initial; commas around mid-sentence
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use as coordinating conjunction to join clauses with just comma
   
   **Root Analysis**: how + ever (in whatever way)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "how" + "ever" → developed adversative meaning
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Synonyms**: even though, despite the fact that, while, whereas
   
   **Antonyms**: because, since, as
   
   **When to Use**: When acknowledging limited worth while making different claim; when conceding one aspect of value while emphasizing another; in complex worth assessments; "though" more casual than "although".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simple contrast without concession is meant (use "whereas"); when "despite" (preposition) is more concise; when "but" serves better in casual speech.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Although [conceded worth statement], [main worth assertion]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial with subordinate clause, or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma after introductory "although" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use "although" + "but" together (redundant)
   
   **Root Analysis**: all + though (entirely + even if)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English compound "all though" → "although"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Although it's not worth much money, it's priceless to me.

   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, nonetheless
   
   **When to Use**: When showing outcomes of worth determinations; when linking value assessment to resulting decisions; in logical arguments about worth; appropriate in formal and academic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation where "so" is more natural; when contrast rather than consequence is needed; when overuse makes writing feel mechanical.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth assessment/cause]. Consequently, [resulting action/decision]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), sometimes mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: period or semicolon before; comma after sentence-initial position
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't treat as coordinating conjunction; ensure genuine causal relationship
   
   **Root Analysis**: consequent (following as result) + -ly
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "consequi" (to follow) → "consequent" → "consequently"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: In casual speech where "so" is more natural; when contrast rather than consequence is needed; when relationship isn't genuinely logical/causal.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth premise]. Therefore, [logical conclusion]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial, mid-sentence, or sentence-final (varying formality)
   - [Punctuation]: semicolon or period before; comma after if sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't overuse in informal writing; ensure genuine logical relationship
   
   **Root Analysis**: there + fore (for that reason)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "thær" (there) + "fore" (for that) → compound
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth statement 1]. In contrast, [Worth statement 2 showing difference]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial as discourse marker
   - [Punctuation]: period before; comma after
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use without establishing what is being contrasted
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + contrast (placed against for comparison)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "contra" (against) + "stare" (stand) → "contrast" → phrase "in contrast"

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Worth statement 1]. Likewise, [parallel worth statement 2]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), sometimes mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: period before; comma after sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't use without clear parallel or similarity
   
   **Root Analysis**: like (similar) + wise (manner)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "gelīc" (similar) + "wīse" (manner) → "likewise"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - [Clause structure]: [Do/choose X] rather than [Y]; [X] is worth [doing] rather than [Y]
   - [Position]: mid-clause, connecting alternatives
   - [Punctuation]: no punctuation typically needed around "rather than"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse "rather than" (preference) with "rather" (somewhat)
   
   **Root Analysis**: rather (more readily, preferably) + than (comparison marker)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hrathor" (sooner, more quickly) + "than" → compound showing preference
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Given that [worth premise], [conclusion/recommendation]
   - [Position]: sentence-initial (most common), sometimes mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: comma after introductory "given that" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Don't confuse with "given" alone (preposition); ensure logical connection
