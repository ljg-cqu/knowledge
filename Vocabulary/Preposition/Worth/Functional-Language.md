1. **Functional Expression**: "It's worth [doing/having/considering]" (function: recommending/suggesting)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A suggestion that something deserves time, attention, or effort; recommends that someone should do or have something because of its value or benefit.
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect
   
   **Synonyms**: I'd recommend [doing], You should [do], It would be valuable to [do], It's worthwhile [doing]
   
   **Antonyms**: Don't bother [doing], It's not worth [doing], Skip [doing]
   
   **When to Use**: Making suggestions or recommendations; when advocating for action based on value assessment; in contexts where you want to encourage without commanding; appropriate for advice-giving across most social relationships.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When direct commands are more appropriate in urgent situations; when your opinion isn't requested and might seem presumptuous; when "should" (stronger obligation) vs. "worth" (optional value) is needed.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "It's definitely worth [doing]" (stronger recommendation)
   - "It might be worth [doing]" (tentative suggestion)
   - "It's well worth [doing]" (emphasis on high value)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This is an indirect recommendation strategy that softens the force of suggestion by focusing on value rather than obligation; uses negative politeness (minimizing imposition); allows recipient freedom to disagree without losing face.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Thanks, I'll give it a try!" / "Good idea, I think I will."
   - Declining: "I'll think about it." / "Maybe later, thanks."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A: "Should I take that course?" B: "Yeah, it's definitely worth taking—I learned a lot."
   - It's worth checking out that new restaurant downtown.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - It's worth considering alternative approaches before finalizing the strategy.
   - The proposal is worth reviewing in detail given its potential implications.

1. **Functional Expression**: "Is it worth [doing/having]?" (function: seeking advice/opinion)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A request for someone's opinion on whether something has sufficient value to justify effort or cost; seeks assessment of worth from another person.
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect
   
   **Synonyms**: Should I [do]?, Would you recommend [doing]?, Do you think I should [do]?
   
   **Antonyms**: I don't think I should [do], I'm not going to [do]
   
   **When to Use**: Seeking advice or recommendations; when you trust someone's judgment; in decision-making contexts; when you want opinion about value-for-effort; appropriate in advice-seeking relationships.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you've already decided and don't want input; when asking someone who lacks relevant knowledge; when the question might seem like you doubt their previous recommendation.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "Do you think it's worth [doing]?" (more tentative, seeking opinion explicitly)
   - "Would it be worth [doing]?" (hypothetical framing)
   - "Is it really worth [doing]?" (expressing doubt, seeking reassurance)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This is a face-saving way to ask for advice by framing it as value assessment rather than admitting uncertainty; shows respect for advisor's judgment; opens discussion rather than demanding yes/no answer.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Positive: "Absolutely, it's definitely worth it." / "Yes, I'd say so."
   - Negative: "Probably not worth the effort." / "I'd skip it if I were you."
   - Hedged: "It depends on what you're looking for." / "That's up to you."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Is it worth buying the extended warranty, or should I skip it?
   - A: "Is that app worth downloading?" B: "Not really—it drains your battery."

1. **Functional Expression**: "I don't think it's worth [doing/having]" (function: declining/advising against)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An indirect way to advise against something or decline based on insufficient value; expresses judgment that effort or cost exceeds benefit.
   - *Formality*: neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect
   
   **Synonyms**: I wouldn't recommend [doing], It's probably not worthwhile, Don't bother [doing], I'd skip it
   
   **Antonyms**: I think it's worth [doing], You should definitely [do], I'd recommend [doing]
   
   **When to Use**: Providing negative advice politely; declining based on value assessment; warning others against actions; when you want to discourage without commanding; appropriate in advice-giving contexts.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - "I don't think it's really worth it" (softened with "really")
   - "Honestly, it's not worth [doing]" (fortified with honesty marker)
   - "It's probably not worth [doing]" (hedged with "probably")
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Hedges the negative advice by presenting it as personal opinion ("I think") rather than objective fact; uses negative politeness to minimize face threat; allows recipient to disagree gracefully.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Yeah, you're probably right." / "Good point, I won't bother."
   - Resisting: "I think I'll try it anyway." / "Maybe for you, but I want to."

   - A: "Should I wait in this line?" B: "Nah, I don't think it's worth it—there's another store nearby."

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - After careful analysis, I don't believe it's worth pursuing this strategy further.

1. **Functional Expression**: "For what it's worth, [opinion/information]" (function: hedging/offering opinion tentatively)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase used to present an opinion or information while downplaying its importance or relevance; acknowledges that the following may or may not be valuable to the listener.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect

   **When NOT to Use**: When you need to be assertive and confident; when your expertise should be foregrounded not downplayed; in formal reports where hedging undermines authority.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "For what it's worth" (standalone, common in casual speech)
   - "FWIW" (internet/text abbreviation)
   - "For whatever it's worth" (slightly more dismissive of own opinion)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This is an extreme hedge that minimizes the imposition of offering opinion; shows deference to recipient's judgment; common in situations where power dynamics or uncertainty make direct assertion inappropriate.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Appreciative: "Thanks, that's actually really helpful." / "I appreciate the input."
   - Neutral: "Hmm, I'll think about that." / "Interesting perspective."
   - Dismissive: "Yeah, we'll see." / "Okay, noted."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - The consultant offered, for what it's worth, an alternative interpretation of the findings.

1. **Functional Expression**: "It's not worth the [trouble/effort/cost]" (function: rejecting/dismissing based on value)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Expresses judgment that something doesn't provide sufficient benefit relative to its cost, effort, or problems; used to reject or discourage based on poor value proposition.
   - *Formality*: neutral

   - "It's just not worth it" (simplified, emphasis on conclusion)
   - "Definitely not worth the trouble" (fortified with "definitely")
   - "Hardly worth the effort" (minimized value with "hardly")
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This provides face-saving justification for rejection by focusing on objective value assessment rather than personal preferences; makes declining seem rational rather than arbitrary; allows recipient to disagree with assessment rather than taking rejection personally.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Fair enough." / "You're probably right."

1. **Functional Expression**: "What's it worth to you?" (function: negotiating/determining value)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A question asking someone to state their valuation or how much they value something; often used in negotiation to determine price or commitment level.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral

   **Common Variations**: 
   - "What would it be worth to you?" (more hypothetical)
   - "How much is it worth to you?" (explicit monetary focus)
   - "What's this worth to you?" (specific item reference)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This can be a power move in negotiation, shifting burden of valuation to the other party; can also be genuinely collaborative in finding mutually agreeable terms; tone and context determine whether cooperative or adversarial.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Direct: "I'd pay up to $X for it."
   - Deflecting: "What are you asking for it?"
   - Avoiding: "I'm not sure yet—what's your price?"

   **When NOT to Use**: When direct commands are more appropriate ("Remember this!"); when overused it loses emphasis; when everything is "worth noting" (dilutes impact).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "It's worth noting that..." (sentence-initial discourse marker)
   - "That's definitely worth remembering" (strengthened)
   - "That's worth keeping in mind" (softer, future-oriented)

   - Acknowledging: "Good point." / "I'll remember that."
   - Agreeing: "Absolutely, that's important." / "Very true."

   **Antonyms**: (no direct antonyms)
   
   **When to Use**: When giving informal valuations or estimates; when offering opinion on worth without claiming expertise; when you want to hedge assessment; appropriate in consultative contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When formal professional appraisal is required; when you shouldn't present opinions as facts; when your assessment might be binding or misunderstood as guarantee.

   - "I'd say it's probably worth..." (additional hedging)
   - "I'd estimate it's worth..." (more quantitative framing)
   - "I would say it's worth..." (formal version)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The conditional "I'd" (I would) hedges the assessment, showing it's a tentative opinion; "say" is softer than "know" or "believe"; allows speaker to offer judgment while maintaining plausible deniability if wrong.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "That sounds about right." / "Thanks for the estimate."
   - Questioning: "Really? I thought it would be more/less."
