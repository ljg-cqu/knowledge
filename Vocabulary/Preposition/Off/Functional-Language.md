   - Right, I'm off to... (British English—discourse marker + announcement)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - I might take you up on that (tentative acceptance)
   - I'll definitely take you up on that (emphatic acceptance)
   - Can I take you up on that offer? (requesting to accept)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The phrasal verb "take up" with "on" creates idiomatic meaning of accepting. Shows respect for offer-giver. More gracious than simple "yes" or "I accept." Implies offer had value worth accepting.

   - You're not even close (more emphatic)
   - That's way off the mark (object-focused rather than person-focused)
