   **When to Use**: Universal usage. Essential for describing separation, distance, absence, abstinence, and price reductions. One of the most versatile English prepositions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Common learner errors include confusing "off" with "of" (pronunciation similar but meanings different). "Off" implies separation/distance; "of" shows possession/relationship.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: off the table, off duty, off work, off the menu, off the record, off limits
   - **Verb + prep**: get off, jump off, fall off, come off, step off, live off
   - **Adjective + prep**: free off (rare), clear off (rare)
   - **Noun + prep**: way off the road, distance off the coast, time off work
   
   **Root Analysis**: off - from Old English "of" (away from)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "of" meant "away from" and evolved into modern "off" by the 1600s to distinguish from "of" (possession/relationship). The spelling split helped clarify two distinct words with different meanings.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Get your feet off the couch!

   **When to Use**: Describing physical removal from surfaces, positions, or contact. Essential for instructions, descriptions of movement, and spatial relationships.
