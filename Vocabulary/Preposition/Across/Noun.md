1. **Noun**: crossing (C, pl: crossings)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A place where something (such as a street, river, or railroad) may be crossed; an intersection or passage point
   - *(Sense 2)* The act of going across from one side to the other; a journey across water or another barrier
   
   **Synonyms**: intersection, crosswalk, passage, traverse, junction
   
   **Antonyms**: barrier, blockage, dead end
   
   **When to Use**: Use when referring to designated places for crossing (pedestrian crossing, border crossing) or the act of traversing from one side to another. Common in transportation, navigation, and urban planning contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when referring to permanent structures like bridges (use "bridge" instead). Avoid when "intersection" alone is more precise.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - pedestrian crossing

   - railroad/railway crossing
   - ocean crossing
   - make a crossing
   
   **Root Analysis**: cross (from Latin crux) + -ing (noun suffix)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - build a bridge across
   - cross the bridge
   - bridge the gap
   - bridge between cultures/ideas

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - cross boundaries
   - push boundaries
   - set boundaries
   - boundary between areas/concepts
   - respect boundaries
   
   **Root Analysis**: bound (limit) + -ary (pertaining to)
