   **Synonyms**: obliquely, at an angle, cornerwise, slantwise
   
   **Antonyms**: straight across, perpendicularly, horizontally, vertically
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing movement or position that crosses at an angle, particularly connecting opposite corners. Essential for geometric, spatial, and directional descriptions.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - cut diagonally across
   - run diagonally across
   - positioned diagonally across
   
   **Root Analysis**: dia- (through, across) + gon- (angle) + -al + -ly → from Greek diagonios
   
   **Etymology**: Greek diagōnios (dia- "across" + gōnia "angle") → Latin diagonalis → Old French diagonal → English diagonal + -ly. Meaning extending from corner to corner.
