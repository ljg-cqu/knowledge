1. **Expression**: across the board (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Applying to all categories, groups, or areas without exception; universally, comprehensively
   - Literal meaning: Spanning the entire board or surface
   - Figurative/Idiomatic meaning: Affecting everyone or everything equally, without discrimination or exception
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: universally, comprehensively, without exception, in all cases, uniformly
   
   **Antonyms**: selectively, partially, in specific cases, discriminately
   
   **When to Use**: Use in business, policy, and analytical contexts to describe changes, increases, decreases, or policies that affect all areas equally. Common in discussions of pay raises, budget cuts, improvements, or trends.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when describing targeted or selective changes. Don't use in contexts where specificity is required rather than generalization. Not appropriate for describing individual cases.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - an across-the-board increase/decrease
   - apply across the board
   - cuts across the board
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Origin from horse racing, where "across the board" meant betting on a horse to win, place, or show (covering all three positions). Extended metaphorically to mean "covering all possibilities or categories."
   
   **Root Analysis**: across (from one side to another) + the board (racing board showing odds)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Everyone got a 5% raise across the board, from interns to executives.
   - Prices have gone up across the board this year.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization implemented across-the-board budget reductions of 10 percent.

1. **Expression**: come across (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To find or encounter something/someone by chance; to discover unexpectedly
   - *(Sense 2)* To be perceived in a certain way; to make a particular impression
   - *Fixedness*: strong (verb-particle combination with specialized meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: encounter, stumble upon, find, discover, run into, meet (for sense 1); appear, seem, be perceived as (for sense 2)
   
   **Antonyms**: search for, seek out (opposite of chance encounter); misrepresent (opposite of how one comes across)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "come across" (sense 1) when describing unexpected discoveries or encounters. Use sense 2 when describing how someone is perceived by others. Common in both casual and professional contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for planned meetings or deliberate searches (use "find" or "meet" instead). Sense 2 can sound judgmental in sensitive contexts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - come across as (+ adjective: confident, arrogant, friendly)
   - come across something/someone
   - never come across anything like this
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The phrasal verb combines "come" (movement) with "across" (traversing space), metaphorically extended to mean encountering something in one's path or how one appears when crossing into someone's perception.
   
   **Root Analysis**: come (Old English cuman) + across (a- + cross)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I came across your old photos while cleaning the attic.
   - He comes across as really confident, but he's actually quite shy.

   - *Fixedness*: strong (common phrasal verb with distinct meaning)
   
   **Synonyms**: communicate, convey, express clearly, make understood, transmit (for sense 1); cross, traverse, make it across (for sense 2)
   
   **Antonyms**: miscommunicate, fail to convey, confuse (for sense 1)
   
   **When to Use**: Use primarily in communication contexts when emphasizing successful transfer of meaning. Common in teaching, presentations, and explanations. Sense 2 is more literal and less frequent.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when simply speaking or writing without emphasis on successful understanding. Avoid overuse in formal academic writing (prefer "communicate" or "convey").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - get the message across
   - get the point across
   - get your ideas across
   - manage to get across (sense 2)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Combines "get" (achieve, accomplish) with "across" (from one side to another), creating metaphor of message traveling from speaker's mind to listener's understanding.
   
   **Root Analysis**: get (Old Norse geta) + across (a- + cross)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm not sure I got my point across clearly in that meeting.
   - He's good at getting complex ideas across in simple terms.

   **Antonyms**: search for, look for, seek out
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing unexpected meetings or discoveries, emphasizing the chance nature of the encounter. Slightly more casual than "come across."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for planned meetings or intentional searches. Less appropriate in very formal writing (prefer "encounter").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - run across someone/something
   - if you run across
   - happened to run across
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Combines "run" (rapid movement) with "across" (traversing space), suggesting the unexpected nature of crossing paths with something during one's journey.
   
   **Root Analysis**: run (Old English rinnan) + across (a- + cross)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I ran across an old college friend at the grocery store yesterday.

   **Antonyms**: go around, follow the perimeter (sense 1); be limited to, be confined to (sense 2)
   
   **When to Use**: Use sense 1 for literal shortcuts and physical crossing. Use sense 2 in analytical contexts when describing phenomena that affect multiple domains or transcend traditional categories.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Sense 2 can sound abstract in concrete discussions. Avoid sense 1 when cutting across would be inappropriate or illegal (trespassing).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - cut across the lawn/field/parking lot
   - cut across boundaries/divisions/lines
   - issues that cut across multiple domains
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Cut" implies direct, often diagonal movement, combined with "across" to emphasize traversing rather than following established paths. Metaphorically extended to ideas or issues that don't follow conventional category boundaries.
   
   **Root Analysis**: cut (Middle English cutten) + across (a- + cross)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let's cut across the park instead of walking around it.

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Put" suggests active placement or positioning, combined with "across" to indicate moving information from one mind to another, emphasizing speaker's intentional effort.

   **Examples [Casual]**:
