1. **Preposition**: across (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* From one side to the other side of something; on the opposite side of something
   - *(Temporal)* Throughout a period of time; during
   - *(Abstract)* In every part of; throughout an area, group, or system; affecting multiple elements
   
   **Synonyms**: over (in some contexts), through (for movement), throughout (for distribution), on the other side of
   
   **Antonyms**: along (parallel to rather than crossing), within (staying inside boundaries)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "across" to indicate movement from one side to another, position on the opposite side, or distribution throughout an area or system. Essential for describing crossing movements, locations relative to reference points, and widespread phenomena.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use "across" when describing vertical movement (use "up/down"), parallel movement (use "along"), or movement into an enclosed space (use "into"). Common errors include confusing "across" with "through" (across = surface, through = interior space).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: across the street, across the board, across the country, across time, across cultures
   - **Verb + prep**: walk across, run across, come across, get across, cut across, stretch across, spread across
   - **Adjective + prep**: scattered across, distributed across, spread across
   - **Noun + prep**: bridge across, path across, view across, journey across
   
   **Root Analysis**: a- (on, to) + cross (from Latin crux meaning "cross")
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English acros, from a- ("on") + cross. Originally meant "in the form of a cross" or "crosswise," later extended to mean "from one side to the other."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I saw your friend across the street waving at us.
   - Can you walk across the bridge and meet me on the other side?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The research findings were consistent across multiple demographic groups.
   - Climate change impacts are evident across all continents and economic sectors.

1. **Preposition**: across from (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* On the opposite side of something, facing something; directly opposite to
   
   **Synonyms**: opposite (to), facing, on the other side of
   
   **Antonyms**: next to, beside, adjacent to
   
   **When to Use**: Use "across from" to indicate a position directly opposite something, particularly when describing locations of buildings, seating arrangements, or face-to-face positions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when objects are merely on different sides but not directly opposite. Avoid in contexts requiring movement (use "across" alone).

   - **Prepositional phrases**: across from the bank, across from each other, sit across from someone
   - **Verb + prep**: live across from, sit across from, stand across from, park across from
   - **Adjective + prep**: located across from, positioned across from
   - **Noun + prep**: house across from, seat across from, table across from
   
   **Root Analysis**: across + from (Old English fram meaning "forward, from")
   
   **Etymology**: Modern English compound preposition combining "across" with "from" to emphasize the facing/opposite relationship rather than movement.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My apartment is across from the coffee shop on Main Street.
   - She sat down across from me and started asking questions.
