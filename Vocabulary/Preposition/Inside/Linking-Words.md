1. **Linking Word**: within (subordinating/connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Inside the limits or boundaries of something; not exceeding specified parameters
   - *Function*: Establishes spatial, temporal, or abstract boundaries; creates relationship of containment or limitation
   
   **Synonyms**: inside, in, in less than (temporal), in the range of
   
   **Antonyms**: beyond, outside, exceeding, past
   
   **When to Use**: Use to establish limits or boundaries in formal writing; connects ideas by showing containment within parameters; appropriate in academic and professional contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly formal in casual contexts; use "in" or "inside" for everyday writing; avoid overuse which creates stilted prose
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject + verb] within [boundary/limit]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence or prepositional phrase position
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required; follows standard prepositional phrase rules
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing with "with" (different meanings); using when "in" would be more natural
   
   **Root Analysis**: with + in (together inside)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English withinnan → within → maintained formal register for expressing containment
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need to finish this within the week.

   **Synonyms**: within, in, into, internally
   
   **Antonyms**: outside, beyond, external to
   
   **When to Use**: Use to show location or containment relationships; connects spatial or metaphorical interior relationships; appropriate in all registers but less formal than "within"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very formal academic writing, "within" may be preferred; avoid "inside of" in formal contexts (redundant "of")
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [subject + verb] inside [location/boundary]
   - [Position]: prepositional phrase position, typically mid-sentence or end
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: adding unnecessary "of" in formal writing; confusing with adverb form
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + side (within boundary)
   
   **Etymology**: in + side → inside → compound showing interior position
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause], while [subordinate clause] OR while [subordinate clause], [independent clause]
   - [Position]: can introduce subordinate clause at beginning or middle
   - [Punctuation]: comma typically separates clauses; comma after introductory "while" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: run-on sentences; forgetting comma when "while" clause comes first
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (Old English hwil, "period of time")
   
   **Etymology**: Old English hwil → while → temporal conjunction showing simultaneity

   - [Clause structure]: [subject + verb] during [noun phrase representing time period]
   - [Position]: typically mid-sentence or prepositional phrase position
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using "during" with clause (use "while" instead); "during the time when" (wordy, use "while")
