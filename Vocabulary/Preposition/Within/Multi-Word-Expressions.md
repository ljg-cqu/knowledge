1. **Expression**: within reason (type: idiomatic phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To a reasonable extent; in a way that is sensible, fair, and moderate; not excessive or extreme
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: reasonably, to a reasonable extent, sensibly, moderately, within reasonable limits
   
   **Antonyms**: excessively, unreasonably, to an extreme, without limits, immoderately
   
   **When to Use**: Use when granting permission with implied limits; appropriate when setting flexible but bounded expectations; common in negotiations, permission-granting, and establishing guidelines; effective for maintaining control while appearing accommodating
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when specific limits are needed (too vague); not appropriate when "reason" might be interpreted very differently by parties; can cause disputes if standards of reasonableness differ
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within reasonable limits
   - within reasonable bounds
   - anything within reason
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The phrase combines the prepositional "within" with the abstract noun "reason" to create a bounded but flexible standard; reflects cultural values of moderation and rationality; "reason" serves as an implicit, context-dependent standard that both parties are expected to understand and respect
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in: inside boundaries) + reason (Latin "ratio": calculation, reasoning) → "inside the boundaries of rational judgment"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You can borrow my car, within reason.
   - I'll help you move, within reason—I'm not carrying a grand piano!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Requests for schedule modifications will be accommodated within reason and subject to operational requirements.

1. **Expression**: within reach (type: idiomatic collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Close enough to be touched or grasped; accessible by extending one's hand
   - Achievable or attainable; possible to accomplish with current resources or abilities (metaphorical)
   - *Fixedness*: strong
   
   **Synonyms**: attainable, accessible, achievable, within grasp, at hand, obtainable
   
   **Antonyms**: out of reach, beyond reach, unattainable, inaccessible, unobtainable
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing physical proximity allowing access or when discussing achievable goals; appropriate in motivational contexts, goal-setting, spatial descriptions; effective for creating optimistic but realistic assessments
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when goals are genuinely unattainable (appears delusional); not appropriate in technical contexts requiring precise probability statements; can sound clichéd in motivational overuse
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within easy reach
   - within arm's reach
   - just within reach
   - well within reach
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Reach" naturally combines with "within" due to semantic compatibility—"reach" implies extension to boundaries, "within" specifies containment by those boundaries; the phrase leverages the embodied spatial metaphor of physical reaching and applies it metaphorically to goals and achievements; high frequency co-occurrence in both literal and figurative uses
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + reach (OE "rǣcan": to extend, stretch) → "inside the extension distance"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep your phone within reach in case I need to call you.
   - That promotion is totally within reach if you keep working hard.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The strategic objectives outlined in the five-year plan remain within reach given current resources.

1. **Expression**: within sight (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Close enough to be seen; visible from current location
   - Close to achievement or completion; near to being realized (metaphorical)
   - *Fixedness*: strong
   
   **Synonyms**: visible, in view, in sight, observable (literal); imminent, approaching, near (metaphorical)
   
   **Antonyms**: out of sight, invisible, hidden (literal); far off, distant, remote (metaphorical)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing visible proximity or when indicating something is close to completion; appropriate in navigation, supervision, progress reporting; effective for indicating nearness or proximity
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when completion is not actually near (false optimism); not appropriate when literal visibility is impossible (nighttime, obstacles); can be clichéd in progress reports
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within sight of [something]
   - within plain sight
   - keep within sight
   - stay within sight
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Sight" naturally pairs with "within" because visual perception has natural boundaries (sight lines, distance limits); the collocation extends metaphorically to describe temporal proximity to goals; conventional usage strengthened by frequent literal use in supervision and navigation contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + sight (OE "gesiht": vision, thing seen) → "inside the boundaries of vision"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep the kids within sight at the beach.
   - We're so close—the finish line is within sight!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All participants must remain within sight of designated supervisors throughout the activity.

1. **Expression**: within limits (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Subject to certain restrictions or boundaries; not unlimited or unrestricted; to a limited extent
   - *Fixedness*: strong
   
   **Synonyms**: to some extent, with restrictions, conditionally, with constraints, with boundaries
   
   **Antonyms**: without limits, unconditionally, unrestricted, boundlessly, limitlessly
   
   **When to Use**: Use when granting qualified permission or acknowledging bounded applicability; appropriate in negotiations, rule-setting, scope definition; effective for establishing that flexibility exists but is not unlimited
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise limits should be specified; not appropriate when unconditional permission is intended; can be frustratingly vague if parties disagree on what the limits are
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within reasonable limits
   - within certain limits
   - within strict limits
   - within the limits of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Limits" semantically requires a relationship to boundaries or containment; "within" explicitly marks positioning relative to boundaries; the phrase is preferred over "inside limits" due to conventional usage; high semantic compatibility and frequency of co-occurrence make this a strong collocation
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + limits (Latin "limes": boundary, border) → "inside the boundaries"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You can joke around, but within limits.
   - Freedom of speech exists, but within limits.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Autonomous decision-making is encouraged within limits established by organizational policy.

   **Antonyms**: outside the scope of, beyond the scope of, excluded from, not covered by
   
   **When to Use**: Use when defining or confirming what is included in a project, study, authority, or responsibility; appropriate in project management, academic writing, legal contexts; effective for establishing clear boundaries of responsibility or coverage
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual speech where "part of" would be simpler; not appropriate when scope is genuinely unclear or disputed; can sound jargon-heavy in non-professional contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - fall within the scope of
   - remain within the scope of
   - stay within the scope of
   - within the scope of authority/responsibility/study
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Scope" (range, extent) semantically requires specification of boundaries; "within" explicitly marks inclusion inside those boundaries; "of" connects to what defines the scope; this three-word collocation is extremely common in professional and academic discourse due to frequent need to define project/authority boundaries
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + scope (Greek "skopos": target, watcher) + of (possessive/specification) → "inside the range of"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Is that within the scope of what we're supposed to do?
   - That's not within the scope of my job.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - *Fixedness*: strong
   
   **Synonyms**: walkable, close by, nearby, at a short distance, accessible on foot
   
   **Antonyms**: too far to walk, out of walking distance, requiring transportation, distant
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing location proximity in real estate, travel, navigation contexts; appropriate in both casual and formal descriptions; effective for indicating convenient proximity
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise distance measurement is needed; not appropriate when walking ability varies significantly among audiences; "walking distance" is subjective and varies by individual
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within easy walking distance
   - within walking distance of [landmark]
   - within a short walking distance
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The phrase combines "within" (boundary marker) with the compound noun "walking distance" (distance coverable by walking); conventional usage in real estate and travel contexts; semantic compatibility high because "distance" naturally pairs with boundary markers; strongly preferred over alternatives like "in walking distance"
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + walking (OE "wealcan": to roll, toss) + distance (Latin "distantia": standing apart) → "inside the range coverable by walking"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The grocery store is within walking distance—maybe ten minutes.
   - Everything you need is within walking distance of the hotel.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: out of earshot, beyond hearing, too far to hear, inaudible distance
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing proximity for auditory communication; appropriate in safety contexts, supervision, narrative descriptions; effective for indicating caution about being overheard or need for auditory proximity
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in contexts where "nearby" would be simpler; not appropriate in written communication contexts (email, text); somewhat informal/literary in tone
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within earshot of [someone/something]
   - stay within earshot
   - keep within earshot
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Earshot" is a compound noun (ear + shot, from archery: "a shot" meaning range) that specifically denotes auditory range; "within" is the conventional preposition for this expression (not "in earshot"); fixed historical usage from archery terminology applied to hearing range; medium-high frequency in narrative and cautionary contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + ear (OE "eare": hearing organ) + shot (OE "sc(e)otan": to project, range) → "inside hearing range"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don't say anything about the party—she's within earshot!
   - Stay within earshot in case I need help.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Supervisors must remain within earshot of participants during all outdoor activities.

   - Having the legal or moral entitlement to do something; acting in a way that is permitted or justified
   - *Fixedness*: strong

   **Antonyms**: overstepping one's rights, not entitled to, unjustified in, without right to
   
   **When to Use**: Use when asserting or acknowledging legal, moral, or social entitlement; appropriate in legal, ethical, and social contexts; effective for defending actions or acknowledging others' prerogatives
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when rights are genuinely disputed (appears to prejudge); not appropriate when softer language about preferences rather than rights would be better; can sound confrontational in some contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within your/his/her/their rights
   - perfectly within one's rights
   - well within one's rights
   - within one's legal rights
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Rights" conceptually exist as boundaries or entitlements; "within" marks positioning inside those boundaries or entitlements; possessive "one's" specifies whose rights; strongly conventionalized in legal and ethical discourse; "within" preferred over "inside" due to formality and convention
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + one's (possessive) + rights (OE "riht": just, correct, proper) → "inside one's proper entitlements"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You're within your rights to complain about that.
   - She's within her rights to refuse.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Use when discussing adherence to rules, laws, propriety, or acceptable standards; appropriate in formal, legal, and ethical contexts; effective for establishing that actions comply with standards
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual speech where simpler expressions would work; not appropriate when "legal" or "acceptable" alone would be clearer; can sound pompous if overused
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - within the bounds of law/decency/propriety/possibility
   - remain within the bounds of
   - stay within the bounds of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Bounds" (plural of bound: boundary, limit) semantically requires relationship to containment or limitation; "within" explicitly marks positioning inside boundaries; "of" specifies what establishes the bounds; conventionalized in legal and formal discourse; strong semantic compatibility and high co-occurrence frequency
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + bounds (OE "bindan": to bind, limit) + of (specification) → "inside the binding limits of"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep your jokes within the bounds of good taste.
   - We're trying to stay within the bounds of what's legal.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: before living memory, in ancient times, historically, long ago
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasizing recency or unprecedented nature of events; appropriate in historical, journalistic, and analytical contexts; effective for emphasizing that current elders witnessed events
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise dating is needed; not appropriate for events from distant past; definition shifts as populations age; can be unclear in contexts with mixed-age audiences
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - the first within living memory
   - unprecedented within living memory
   - the worst within living memory
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The phrase uses "living memory" as a temporal boundary marked by generational experience; "within" specifies temporal containment by this boundary; strongly conventionalized in historical and journalistic discourse; the metaphor treats collective memory as a bounded temporal space
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (with + in) + living (OE "libban": to be alive) + memory (Latin "memoria": remembrance) → "inside the temporal span of living people's recall"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This is the worst storm within living memory.
   - Nothing like this has happened within living memory.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:
