   *Characteristics*: Conversational phrasing ("how I did it," "totally different route"), contracted forms acceptable, less precise language  
   *Use when*: Speaking with friends, colleagues you're comfortable with, informal discussions, relaxed work environments
   
   **Semi-Formal**: In contrast to my approach, they employed a different methodology.  
   *Characteristics*: Professional vocabulary ("employed," "methodology"), complete sentences, balanced tone, clear structure  
   *Use when*: Professional emails, team meetings, presentations to colleagues, business communications, standard workplace interactions

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher status = formal; peers/subordinates = semi-formal to casual
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers/new contacts = semi-formal to formal; established relationships = casual to semi-formal
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Critical business decisions = formal; routine discussions = casual to semi-formal
   - *Cultural Context*: Academic settings prefer formal; creative industries accept casual
   - *Medium*: Written reports = formal; spoken team meetings = semi-formal; instant messages = casual
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "totally different route" in formal written reports (too colloquial for context)
   - Using "substantially different approach" in casual conversation with friends (overly formal, sounds pretentious)
   - Overusing humor in professional settings where it might undermine credibility
   
   **Cultural Notes**: American workplace culture generally accepts more casual language than British; academic and legal contexts universally require formal register regardless of culture
