1. **Preposition**: unlike (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Different from; not similar to; in contrast to
   - *(Abstract)* Not typical or characteristic of (someone's usual behavior or nature)
   - *(Abstract)* In a way that contrasts with; as opposed to
   
   **Synonyms**: different from (in formal contexts), in contrast to (emphasizing difference), as opposed to (showing opposition), contrary to (stronger contrast), dissimilar to (formal)
   
   **Antonyms**: like, similar to, akin to, resembling, comparable to
   
   **When to Use**: Emphasizing differences between two entities, contrasting characteristics or behaviors, showing deviation from expected patterns; appropriate in both formal and informal writing; sentence-initial position for emphasis
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When highlighting similarities; common learner error: using "unlike" with a verb phrase ("unlike he does"—incorrect; must be followed by noun/noun phrase: "unlike him"); avoid overuse which can make writing feel forced
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: unlike before, unlike anything else, unlike other cases, unlike most people
   - **Verb + prep**: (rare; "unlike" typically begins phrases rather than follows verbs)
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not applicable; "unlike" is not a dependent preposition)
   - **Noun + prep**: behavior unlike X, something unlike Y, a response unlike Z
   
   **Root Analysis**: un- (negative prefix: not) + like (similar)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English → un- (negative prefix) + like (from Old English "gelīc") → developed as preposition in 15th century to express difference and contrast

   - Unlike my brother, I'm terrible at sports and always have been.

1. **Preposition**: nothing unlike (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Not different from; quite similar to; bearing resemblance to (double negative construction)
   
   **Synonyms**: similar to, not dissimilar to, comparable to, akin to, rather like
   
   **Antonyms**: completely unlike, totally different from, nothing like
   
   **When to Use**: Formal or literary writing where subtle nuance is needed; expressing cautious similarity; understatement for rhetorical effect; less common in modern usage
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (too formal/archaic); contexts requiring clear direct statements (the double negative can confuse); modern informal writing prefers "similar to" or "like"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: nothing unlike what we expected, nothing unlike previous examples
   - **Verb + prep**: is nothing unlike, seems nothing unlike
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not applicable)
   - **Noun + prep**: outcome nothing unlike X, result nothing unlike Y
   
   **Root Analysis**: no + thing (negation) + un- (negative prefix) + like (similar) → double negative

   **When to Use**: Emphasizing strong or surprising differences, formal and semi-formal writing, academic comparisons, highlighting unexpected contrasts

   - **Noun + prep**: approach quite unlike X, method quite unlike Y

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: most unlike his usual behavior, most unlike traditional approaches
   - **Verb + prep**: is most unlike, seems most unlike, appears most unlike
   - **Adjective + prep**: (not applicable)
   - **Noun + prep**: response most unlike X, behavior most unlike Y
   
   **Root Analysis**: most (superlative degree) + un- (not) + like (similar)
