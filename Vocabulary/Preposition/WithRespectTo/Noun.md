1. **Noun**: respect (C/U)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (U) Consideration for a particular aspect or feature when judging something ("in this respect"); a specific way in which something can be seen or evaluated.
   - (C) A particular aspect, point, or regard: "in many respects" = in many ways.
   
   **Synonyms**: aspect, regard, point, way, dimension
   
   **Antonyms**: whole, totality, generality
   
   **When to Use**: When talking about specific aspects in evaluation or comparison ("in this respect," "in many respects"), especially when you have just mentioned "with respect to" a particular topic.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don’t confuse this sense with "respect" meaning politeness or admiration; avoid in very casual speech where "way" or "aspect" sounds more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - in this respect
   - in many respects
   - in other respects
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (back) + spect (look) → "look back at, regard"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *respectus* (act of looking back, regard) → Old French *respect* → English "respect" (regard, consideration; later also politeness).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new app is better in this respect, especially with respect to speed.
   - Theyre similar in many respects, but different with respect to risk.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In this respect, the revised method improves substantially with respect to robustness.
   - The systems are equivalent in most respects with respect to their observable behavior.

1. **Noun**: aspect (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - One part or feature of a situation, problem, or thing; one of the ways in which it can be considered.
   
   **Synonyms**: facet, dimension, side, feature, angle
   
   **Antonyms**: whole, entirety, overall picture
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to split a complex topic into parts ("cost aspect," "security aspect") and then talk about each part with respect to specific criteria.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid as vague filler ("every aspect of everything"); when a more concrete noun like "cost" or "timeline" is available.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - important aspect of
   - in every aspect
   - one aspect is that...
   
   **Root Analysis**: a(d)- (toward) + spect (look) → "how something looks"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *aspectus* (appearance, sight) → Middle English "aspect" (appearance, way of looking at something).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - One important aspect, with respect to time, is how long users have to wait.
   - From the cost aspect, this is pretty good value.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We examine each aspect of the system with respect to performance, reliability, and maintainability.
   - Security is a critical aspect, particularly with respect to data handling.

1. **Noun**: parameter (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A quantity that affects the output of a system but is considered as given for a particular analysis; a variable that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.
   
   **Synonyms**: variable, factor, setting, input, control
   
   **Antonyms**: constant (in some contexts), fixed value (when not allowed to vary)
   
   **When to Use**: In mathematics, statistics, computing, and engineering when talking about values you tune or fix and then study behavior with respect to those values.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In everyday conversation where "setting" or "factor" is clearer; avoid vague business-jargon uses like "within those parameters" without specifying them.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - model parameter
   - tune a parameter
   - with respect to a given parameter
   
   **Root Analysis**: para- (beside) + meter (measure) → something measured alongside
   
   **Etymology**: Greek *parametros* (beside measure) → French *paramètre* → English "parameter" (mathematics, 18th–19th c.).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you change this parameter, the result shifts a lot with respect to accuracy.
   - We need to figure out which parameters really matter with respect to user experience.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We analyze performance with respect to three key parameters: batch size, depth, and learning rate.
   - Sensitivity with respect to each parameter was assessed using one-factor-at-a-time experiments.

1. **Noun**: dimension (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A measurable extent such as length or time; more generally, one of several directions or aspects along which something can vary or be evaluated.
   
   **Synonyms**: aspect, axis, measure, facet, perspective
   
   **Antonyms**: single line, flat view, one-sidedness
   
   **When to Use**: When framing multi-dimensional evaluation ("time dimension," "cost dimension") or multi-axis data, and then talking about behavior with respect to one dimension at a time.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In everyday talk where "side" or "part" is simpler; avoid as empty jargon when no clear axes are defined.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - along each dimension
   - across multiple dimensions
   - with respect to the time dimension
   
   **Root Analysis**: di(s)- (apart) + mens (measure) + -ion (act/state)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *dimensio* (measuring out) → Old French *dimension* → English "dimension" (physical measurement → abstract axes).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you look at it along the time dimension, its stable with respect to changes.
   - We need to think about this across a few dimensionscost, time, and risk.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Utility is evaluated with respect to each dimension separately before aggregation.
   - The model operates in a high-dimensional space with respect to the feature representation.

1. **Noun**: baseline (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A starting point or standard used for comparison; the original level of something before changes are made.
   
   **Synonyms**: reference point, benchmark, starting level, standard
   
   **Antonyms**: target (goal state), outcome, deviation
   
   **When to Use**: When comparing current results with respect to an earlier state or control condition ("improvement over baseline," "relative to baseline").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When no clear "before" state exists; in very casual speech where "starting point" is better.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - relative to baseline
   - improvement over baseline
   - establish a baseline
   
   **Root Analysis**: base (foundation) + line (mark, limit)
   
   **Etymology**: Originally from surveying and sports; adopted widely in statistics and experimentation for reference levels.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Relative to our baseline, this is a big win with respect to speed.
   - Lets set a baseline so we can measure changes with respect to it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All effects are reported with respect to a common baseline condition.
   - Performance is expressed as a percentage improvement over baseline with respect to accuracy.

1. **Noun**: criterion (C, pl: criteria)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A standard or principle by which something is judged or decided; one of several rules used to evaluate options.
   
   **Synonyms**: standard, benchmark, measure, yardstick, rule
   
   **Antonyms**: arbitrariness, whim, guess
   
   **When to Use**: When describing explicit evaluation rules ("selection criteria") and then judging options with respect to each criterion.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In everyday talk where "rule" or "thing we look at" is simpler; avoid mixing singular "criteria" with plural use ("one criteria" is incorrect).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - evaluation criteria
   - key criterion
   - with respect to a given criterion
   
   **Root Analysis**: criter (judge, decide) + -ion (noun)
   
   **Etymology**: Greek *kriterion* (means of judging) → Latin *criterium* → English "criterion"; plural "criteria" retained from Greek.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - One main criterion, with respect to this choice, is how much time it saves you.
   - We used different criteria with respect to hiring for this role.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Alternatives were ranked with respect to each criterion: cost, risk, and impact.
   - Under this criterion, the method performs poorly with respect to rare events.
