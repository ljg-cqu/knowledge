1. **Adverb**: relatively (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To a certain extent when compared with something else; in a way that is true only with respect to a particular reference point or standard.
   - *Position*: Usually before adjective/adverb ("relatively small"), or sentence‑initial with comma.
   
   **Synonyms**: comparatively, somewhat, fairly, moderately, in relative terms
   
   **Antonyms**: absolutely, extremely, completely, outright
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to qualify a statement by saying it holds only with respect to some comparison (e.g., relatively cheap with respect to quality, relatively stable with respect to time).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When an absolute statement is intended; avoid stacking with other hedges ("relatively quite") in formal writing.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - relatively small/large with respect to
   - relatively stable with respect to time
   - relatively insensitive with respect to parameter choice
   - relatively speaking, ...
   
   **Root Analysis**: relative (comparative) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From "relative" in the sense of "in relation to something" → adverb "relatively".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The risk is relatively low with respect to the potential benefit.
   - That’s relatively cheap compared to what others charge.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The algorithm is relatively efficient with respect to input size.

1. **Adverb**: respectively (type: sentence)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In the order given; for each item in turn, with respect to the previously mentioned sequence.
   - *Position*: Typically sentence‑final or immediately after the list it refers to.
   
   **Synonyms**: in that order, in the same order, correspondingly (partial overlap)
   
   **Antonyms**: jointly, collectively, together (when order is irrelevant)
   
   **When to Use**: When mapping two or more ordered lists to each other (A, B, C correspond to X, Y, Z respectively) so that relationships are clear with respect to position.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When there are only single items on each side; when order does not matter; avoid overuse in simple sentences where clearer rephrasing is possible.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - A, B, and C scored 80, 85, and 90, respectively.
   - Precision and recall improved by 5% and 8%, respectively, with respect to the baseline.
   
   **Root Analysis**: respect (regard, relation) + -ive (adjective) + -ly (adverb)
   
   **Etymology**: From "respective" (relating to each separately) → adverb "respectively" (in the order given).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Alice and Bob got first and second place, respectively.
   - The two models focus on speed and accuracy, respectively, with respect to user needs.

   - Sensitivity and specificity increased to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, with respect to baseline values.

1. **Adverb**: comparatively (type: degree/sentence)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To a moderate degree when compared with something else; in comparison, and therefore only with respect to a chosen reference.
   - *Position*: Usually sentence‑initial ("Comparatively, ...") or before adjectives/adverbs ("comparatively low").
   
   **Synonyms**: relatively, by comparison, in comparative terms, somewhat
   
   **Antonyms**: absolutely, inherently, intrinsically
   
   **When to Use**: When highlighting that a property holds only when viewed with respect to some benchmark (e.g., comparatively simple with respect to alternatives).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When no clear reference point has been established; avoid in very informal speech where "relatively" or "by comparison" sounds more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - comparatively simple with respect to other methods
   - comparatively small impact with respect to cost
   - comparatively stable with respect to previous years
   
   **Root Analysis**: comparative (based on comparison) + -ly
   
   **Etymology**: From "comparative" (relative, involving comparison) → "comparatively".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This option is comparatively cheap with respect to what you usually buy.
   - The new workflow is comparatively easy once you get used to it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposed algorithm is comparatively efficient with respect to memory usage.
   - Error rates remain comparatively low with respect to competing approaches.

1. **Adverb**: proportionally (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that maintains a constant ratio with respect to another quantity; so that changes scale together.
   - *Position*: Usually before verb or at clause level ("increases proportionally with").
   
   **Synonyms**: in proportion, correspondingly, in a linearly related way
   
   **Antonyms**: disproportionately, unevenly, irregularly
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that one variable changes with respect to another at a fixed rate (e.g., cost increases proportionally with respect to usage).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For non‑linear or threshold effects; avoid as vague intensifier in non‑quantitative contexts.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - grows proportionally with respect to
   - scales proportionally with input size
   - increases proportionally with demand
   - adjust proportionally with respect to risk
   
   **Root Analysis**: proportional (in fixed ratio) + -ly
   
   **Etymology**: From "proportional" → "proportionally".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Your pay goes up proportionally with your hours, with respect to overtime.
   - The noise seems to rise proportionally with the number of people.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Execution time grows proportionally with respect to the number of elements.

1. **Adverb**: jointly (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Together with one or more others; in a way that shares responsibility or ownership, often with respect to a specific aspect such as rights, liability, or distribution.

   **Synonyms**: together, collectively, in partnership, in concert, cooperatively
   
   **Antonyms**: separately, individually, independently, alone
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that an action or property is shared with respect to parties, factors, or dimensions (e.g., jointly continuous with respect to x and y).

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - jointly with
   - jointly determine with respect to
   - jointly responsible with respect to obligations
   - jointly continuous with respect to two variables

   **When to Use**: When describing small improvements or differences with respect to a comparison point (e.g., marginally better with respect to accuracy).
