1. **Functional Expression**: With respect to [topic], [comment/decision] (function: topic‑shifting and framing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Pragmatic function: To narrow the discussion to a specific dimension or topic before giving information, an opinion, or a decision.
   - *Formality*: formal/neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect framing of topic (softens transitions and criticism)
   
   **Synonyms**: Regarding [topic], Concerning [topic], As for [topic], In terms of [topic]
   
   **Antonyms**: Broadly speaking (no specific topic), In general (no narrowing)
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to be precise about which aspect youre addressing (e.g., cost, timeline, quality) and want a smooth, formal transition into your point.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual conversation, or when the topic is already crystal clear and over‑signalling formality would sound stiff.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - With respect to cost, ...
   - With respect to performance, ...
   - With respect to your earlier question, ...
   - With respect to timelines and scope, ...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Serves as a discourse marker signalling a scoped reply. Useful in meetings and documents with many dimensions (risk, budget, people) to avoid ambiguity about what youre answering.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Narrow follow‑up: "With respect to costs, that makes sense; with respect to risk, Im less convinced."
   - Clarifying question: "Do you mean with respect to delivery date or total budget?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - With respect to timing, were still aiming for next month.
   - With respect to your idea, I like it but Id simplify the rollout.

1. **Functional Expression**: [X] varies with respect to [Y] (function: describing dependence)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Pragmatic function: To state that one quantity changes as another quantity changes, without necessarily specifying the exact functional form.
   - *Formality*: formal/technical
   - *Directness*: direct description of dependence
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] depends on [Y], [X] changes as [Y] changes, [X] is a function of [Y]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] is independent of [Y], [X] remains constant as [Y] varies
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to highlight a dependency or trend (e.g., cost with respect to volume, error with respect to sample size) in technical or analytical contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation where "goes up when" or "goes down when" is more natural; when the relationship is speculative rather than observed.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - [Metric] varies with respect to [parameter].
   - Performance varies with respect to input size.
   - Satisfaction varies with respect to response time.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Keeps the statement neutral about causalityit signals association or dependence with respect to Y, not necessarily that Y causes X.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "In what way does it vary with respect to Ylinearly, monotonically, or more complexly?"
   - "Can we control Y to stabilize X, given how X varies with respect to it?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My energy really varies with respect to how much I sleep.
   - Our traffic varies a lot with respect to the time of day.

1. **Functional Expression**: [X] is small/large/negligible with respect to [baseline] (function: qualifying significance)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Pragmatic function: To describe the magnitude of something relative to a reference point, often to justify ignoring it or treating it as dominant.
   - *Formality*: neutral/formal
   - *Directness*: indirect evaluation through comparison
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] is minor/major compared to [baseline], [X] is negligible/significant relative to [baseline]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] is dominant relative to [baseline], [X] is substantial with respect to [baseline]
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to keep the discussion explicitly relative (e.g., noise is negligible with respect to signal; cost is small with respect to savings).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When talking about absolute amounts that matter on their own (e.g., safety risks); avoid downplaying critical issues as "negligible" without evidence.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - statistically negligible with respect to sampling error
   - operational overhead is small with respect to benefits
   - latency is large with respect to user tolerance
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Often used to justify approximations or prioritization decisions; implicitly encodes a value judgment about what counts as "small" or "large" with respect to context.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Negligible with respect to what metric?"
   - "For which stakeholders is that still small with respect to their constraints?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The delay is tiny with respect to how long we used to wait.
   - The extra cost is pretty small with respect to the peace of mind it buys.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - The added complexity is large with respect to the marginal performance gain.

1. **Functional Expression**: I have a question/concern with respect to [topic] (function: raising issues politely)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Formality*: neutral/formal
   - *Directness*: indirect but clear; softens potential criticism
   
   **Synonyms**: Id like to ask about, I have some concerns about, Im unsure about
   
   **Antonyms**: I have no concerns regarding, Im fully comfortable with
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to challenge or clarify a specific dimension (e.g., risk, scope, ethics) without sounding confrontational.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual talk ("Im worried about...") or when strong, direct opposition is needed ("I object to...").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I have a question with respect to the timeline.
   - I have a concern with respect to data privacy.
   - I have two issues with respect to the current proposal.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Frequently used in meetings and reviews; frames your input as a focused, bounded issue rather than a broad attack.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Sure, whats your question with respect to the timeline?"
   - "Thank youlets address that concern with respect to privacy in detail."

   **Synonyms**: Evaluate [X] in terms of [criterion], Judge [X] against [standard], Assess [X] relative to [metric]
   
   **Antonyms**: Evaluate [X] without reference to criteria, Make a general/unqualified judgment
   
   **When to Use**: When decisions depend on a specific dimension (e.g., cost, reliability, usability) and you want to avoid confusion with other criteria.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When a holistic or qualitative judgment is intended without strict criteria; with audiences unfamiliar with the chosen metric.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - evaluate options with respect to risk and cost
   - assess performance with respect to throughput and latency
   - evaluate the design with respect to accessibility
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Encourages multi‑criteria thinking; makes trade‑offs explicit by separating dimensions of evaluation.

   **When to Use**: In optimization, planning, and design when you must be explicit about what youre trying to improve (e.g., optimize cost with respect to quality and time constraints).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: With non‑technical audiences who might understand "improve" but not "optimize with respect to"; when the objective is vague.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - optimize throughput with respect to latency constraints
   - optimize parameters with respect to validation loss
   - optimize schedule with respect to resource availability
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Encodes both goal and trade‑off axes in one compact expression; essential in quantitative and algorithmic contexts.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Are we optimizing with respect to cost, speed, or reliability?"
   - "Can we re‑phrase this as optimizing with respect to user impact instead of just traffic?"
