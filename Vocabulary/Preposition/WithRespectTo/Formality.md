   **Casual**: The function doesnt have any jumps when you look at it over time.  
   *Characteristics*: Everyday words ("jumps," "look at it"), direct explanation rather than formulaic phrasing.  
   *Use when*: Explaining to non‑experts, informal whiteboard sessions, tutoring contexts.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: The function is smooth over time; there are no jumps as time changes.

   **Formal**: The function is continuous with respect to time.  
   *Characteristics*: Standard mathematical phrasing; compact, unambiguous within technical communities.

   **Humorous**: Think of it as a drama‑free functionno sudden plot twists as time moves on.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor ("drama‑free"), storytelling tone; still hints at "no sudden changes."  
   *Use when*: Lightening a technical explanation, teaching, or keeping students engaged.
   
   **Lively**: As time flows, the curve moves smoothlyno cliffs, no gaps, just a continuous track.  
   *Characteristics*: Visual language ("flows," "cliffs," "track"), vivid but still accurate.  
   *Use when*: Talks, videos, or workshops where imagery helps comprehension.

   **Common Mistakes**:

   - Mixing registers in one sentence ("kinda continuous with respect to...").
   - Using Formal phrasing with non‑technical audiences who need intuition first.
