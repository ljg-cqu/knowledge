1. **Adjective**: relative (comp: more relative, sup: most relative)
   **Meaning**:

   **Synonyms**: comparative, proportional, dependent, contextual, reference-based
   
   **Antonyms**: absolute, independent, fixed, standalone
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that a value, position, or judgment makes sense only when compared to something else, especially in academic, technical, or analytical writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When talking about fixed, context-free facts (use "absolute" instead); avoid in very casual speech where "compared to" is clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - relative to
   - relative with respect to time/space
   - relative change with respect to the baseline
   - relative importance with respect to other factors
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (back, again) + lat (carry, bear) + -ive (having the nature of)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin *relativus* (having reference) → Middle French *relatif* → English "relative" (having connection, not absolute).

1. **Adjective**: invariant (comp: more invariant, sup: most invariant)

   **Synonyms**: unchanged, constant, stable, fixed, preserved
   
   **Antonyms**: variable, changing, sensitive, dependent
   
   **When to Use**: In mathematics, physics, computer science, and statistics to describe quantities or properties that stay the same with respect to certain transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, re‑parametrization).

   - invariant feature with respect to lighting
   - quantity invariant with respect to re‑parametrization

   - symmetric with respect to the y‑axis
   - symmetric with respect to time reversal
   - symmetric relationship with respect to A and B

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product
   - orthogonal components with respect to variance
   - orthogonal axes with respect to the origin

   - effort roughly proportional with respect to complexity
   
   **Root Analysis**: pro- (forward) + port (carry) + -ion (act) + -al (relating to)

   **When to Use**: In technical and analytical contexts to describe models, metrics, or outcomes that do not change much with respect to perturbations in inputs or assumptions.
