1. **Expression**: with respect to (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal multi-word preposition meaning "concerning" or "in relation to" a specific aspect, topic, or variable.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly conventional in legal, academic, and technical English; words and order are not normally changed).
   
   **Synonyms**: regarding, concerning, with regard to, in relation to, in terms of
   
   **Antonyms**: irrespective of, regardless of, independent of
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to narrow a statement to a clear dimension (cost, time, quality, risk) or variable, especially in structured argument, analysis, or technical writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very casual conversation ("about" is usually better); avoid repeating it in every sentence of a paragraph; do not use where no specific aspect is being contrasted with others.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - with respect to cost/time/quality
   - with respect to your question/concern
   - with respect to X and Y (contrasting two dimensions)
   - with particular respect to X (more formal and emphatic)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Combines "with" (accompaniment), "respect" (regard, consideration), and "to" (direction) into a phrase that literally means "with regard directed to". This compactly signals that what follows is framed relative to a specific focus.
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (accompaniment) + respect (from Latin *respectus*, "regard") + to (direction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - With respect to timing, were still aiming for next month.
   - With respect to your idea, I like it but we should start smaller.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - With respect to data privacy, all processing will occur within the EEA.
   - The function is continuous with respect to time on the interval [0, 1].

1. **Expression**: in this respect (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In this particular way, aspect, or regard; considering only the specific feature just mentioned.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (wording is stable; usually not changed to other prepositions or order).
   
   **Synonyms**: in this regard, in this sense, on this point, in this aspect
   
   **Antonyms**: in other respects, in general, overall
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to comment on or evaluate something only in one specific respect that has just been introduced (often after a clause describing that aspect).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you are giving a general evaluation, or when several aspects are mixed together; avoid in very casual speech where "in this way" or "for this part" sounds more natural.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in this respect
   - in this particular respect
   - in this limited respect
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Respect" here means "aspect" or "regard"; "in this respect" fixes attention on one dimension, tightly linking to nearby sentences that use "with respect to" that same dimension.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + this (deictic determiner) + respect (aspect, regard)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new plan is much clearer, and in this respect its a big improvement.
   - Shes very patient, and in this respect shes great to work with.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The model performs well in this respect, with respect to robustness against noise.
   - The intervention is effective in this respect, particularly with respect to long-term retention.

1. **Expression**: in many respects (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In many ways or aspects; considering several different dimensions at once.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (set phrase; usually not altered except for "in most respects" or "in several respects").
   
   **Synonyms**: in many ways, in many aspects, on many points, to a large extent
   
   **Antonyms**: in few respects, only in some respects, hardly at all
   
   **When to Use**: When comparing two things or versions and you want to say they are similar, better, or worse across several respects rather than just one.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When you are talking about exactly one clearly defined dimension; when precision about which respect(s) is required.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in many respects
   - in most respects
   - in several respects
   - in important respects
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Extends the "respect" = "aspect" meaning to a plural, summary view; pairs naturally with comparative structures where multiple dimensions have already been described "with respect to" different criteria.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + many (plural quantifier) + respects (plural of respect = aspects)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In many respects, this version is better with respect to usability.
   - The two teams are alike in many respects, especially in how they work with users.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - In many respects, the new policy aligns with existing practice, particularly with respect to reporting structures.
   - The approaches are similar in many respects with respect to their underlying assumptions.

1. **Expression**: in other respects (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Apart from the particular respect just mentioned; in different ways or aspects.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard contrastive phrase used after discussing one dimension).
   
   **Synonyms**: in other ways, otherwise, on other points
   
   **Antonyms**: in this respect, in all respects
   
   **When to Use**: After focusing on one problematic or exceptional aspect, when you want to say that in most other respects things are different (often better or normal).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Without first establishing the respect that is being contrasted; avoid if the contrast is not clear from context.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in other respects
   - in most other respects
   - in almost all other respects
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Functions as a ready-made contrast tool to balance earlier statements made "with respect to" one dimension, by explicitly shifting attention to remaining dimensions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + other (different) + respects (aspects)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The UI is confusing, but in other respects the app works well.
   - The schedule is tight, though in other respects the plan is realistic.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The system shows weaknesses with respect to scalability but, in other respects, performs satisfactorily.
   - The proposal is risky in this respect; in other respects, however, it aligns with strategic priorities.

1. **Expression**: in all respects (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In every way or aspect; completely, when all relevant respects are considered.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (commonly used as a set phrase, especially in formal evaluations).
   
   **Synonyms**: in every way, completely, fully, in every respect
   
   **Antonyms**: in some respects, in few respects, partially
   
   **When to Use**: When making a strong, global judgment that covers all major dimensions you might otherwise talk about "with respect to" one by one.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When only some aspects are being evaluated; when there are clear exceptions; overuse can sound exaggerated or imprecise.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in all respects
   - in every respect
   - identical in all respects
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - Provides a concise way to collapse a multi-dimensional "with respect to X/Y/Z" analysis into a global statement, emphasizing that there are no important exceptions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + all (entire set) + respects (aspects)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The two versions are basically the same in all respects that matter to me.
   - The new laptop is better in all respects, especially with respect to battery life.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The implementation complies in all respects with the specified requirements.
   - The revised contract is, in all respects, consistent with the governing regulations.
