   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that follows or agrees with rules, standards, decisions, or wishes; conforming to requirements
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: in line with, in conformity with, pursuant to, consistent with, according to
   
   **Antonyms**: in violation of, contrary to, at odds with, in breach of
   
   **When to Use**: Legal documents, formal policies, compliance statements, official communications, regulatory contexts, contracts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation (too formal/bureaucratic), informal emails, creative writing, when simpler expressions work
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in strict accordance with (emphasizes rigorous compliance)
   - in full accordance with (emphasizes complete compliance)
   - in close accordance with (emphasizes alignment)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal preposition*: "Accordance" derives from accord (agreement/harmony); the phrase has become the standard formal way to express compliance with rules. "In accordance with" is the conventionalized legal and administrative formula, appearing in statutes, contracts, and official documents since the 17th century. Alternative prepositions (*by accordance, *for accordance) are ungrammatical.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition) + ac- (to) + cord (heart) + -ance (noun suffix) + with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Rarely used casually - sounds bureaucratic] "We need to do this in accordance with the rules."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All financial transactions must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
   - The project will be executed in accordance with the specifications outlined in Appendix B.

1. **Expression**: comply with (type: verb + preposition collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To act in accordance with rules, regulations, requests, or wishes; to obey or follow
   - *Fixedness*: strong (dependent preposition - "comply" requires "with")
   
   **Synonyms**: adhere to, conform to, obey, follow, abide by, observe
   
   **Antonyms**: violate, breach, defy, disobey, contravene
   
   **When to Use**: Regulatory contexts, legal requirements, policy enforcement, formal requests, compliance discussions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When cooperation is voluntary (use "cooperate" or "work with"), creative contexts, when simpler words suffice
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - fail to comply with (negative form)
   - fully comply with (emphasizes completeness)
   - comply strictly with (emphasizes rigor)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Comply" comes from Latin complēre (to fill up, complete), evolving to mean "fulfill requirements." English requires "comply WITH" rather than *comply to or *comply for. This is a dependent preposition pattern established in the 17th century. The preposition "with" indicates accompaniment or agreement, creating the meaning of "going along with" requirements.
   
   **Root Analysis**: com- (completely) + plēre (to fill) + with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You need to comply with the dress code if you want to enter.
   - He refuses to comply with the new parking rules.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: comply with, adhere to, follow, accord with, correspond to, match
   
   **Antonyms**: deviate from, depart from, diverge from, differ from
   
   **When to Use**: Quality standards, social norms, technical specifications, manufacturing standards, describing adherence to patterns
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing innovation or creative deviation, when independence is valued
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - conform to standards (quality contexts)
   - conform to expectations (social contexts)
   - conform with requirements (regulatory contexts)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Conform" from Latin conformāre (to fashion, shape similarly). Takes both "to" and "with" - "conform TO" (more common in modern usage) emphasizes the target standard, while "conform WITH" (formal/British) emphasizes agreement. Both prepositions create the meaning of matching or aligning with external standards.
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + form (shape) + to/with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new design doesn't conform to what we discussed.
   - Everyone just conforms to what the group thinks.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Manufacturing processes must conform to ISO 9001 quality management standards.

   **Antonyms**: deviate from, depart from, abandon, violate, disregard
   
   **When to Use**: Describing commitment to principles, rules, schedules, or standards; emphasizing faithful following
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversations about simple following (use "follow"), when flexibility is valued
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - strictly adhere to (emphasizes rigor)
   - adhere closely to (emphasizes faithfulness)
   - fail to adhere to (negative form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Adhere" from Latin adhaerēre (to stick to). The preposition "to" is required to indicate the object being stuck to or followed. *Adhere with or *adhere on are ungrammatical. The metaphor of physical sticking creates the meaning of firm commitment or close following.
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to) + haerēre (to stick) + to (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You really need to adhere to the schedule if we want to finish on time.
   - She strictly adheres to her morning routine.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Research participants must adhere to the prescribed treatment protocol.

   **When to Use**: Business strategy, policy alignment, showing consistency with expectations or standards, professional communication
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very formal legal documents (prefer "in accordance with"), highly casual speech
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in line with expectations (performance contexts)
   - in line with policy (compliance contexts)
   - in line with industry standards (benchmarking)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal preposition*: Metaphor of physical alignment (being "in line") extended to conceptual agreement. The phrase emerged in 20th century business language. "Line" represents the standard or expectation, and being "in" that line means matching it. Alternative prepositions (*on line with, *by line with) don't work - "in" is required for this metaphorical usage.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition) + line (row, standard) + with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Is this budget in line with what we spent last year?
   - Your results are totally in line with what we expected.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposed initiative is in line with organizational strategic objectives.

   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: as stated by, per, in accordance with, as reported by, based on
   
   **Antonyms**: contrary to, despite, regardless of, notwithstanding
   
   **When to Use**: Universal - all registers; citing sources, referencing policies, attributing information, following rules
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very rarely inappropriate - most versatile attribution expression
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - according to [person] (citing sources)
   - according to plan (matching expectations)
   - according to the rules (following regulations)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal preposition*: From "accord" (agreement) + "to" (directional). The phrase grammaticalized from "to be in accord with something" to become a fixed preposition. "According to" is the standard English pattern - *according with or *according by are ungrammatical. Emerged in Middle English (14th century) and became the standard citation formula.
   
   **Root Analysis**: ac- (to) + cord (heart) + -ing (gerund) + to (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - According to Sarah, the meeting was canceled.
   - Everything went according to plan.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - According to the latest research findings, climate patterns have shifted significantly.

1. **Expression**: abide by (type: phrasal verb)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To accept and act in accordance with a rule, decision, or agreement; to follow faithfully
   - *Fixedness*: strong (phrasal verb - meaning changes with particle)
   
   **Synonyms**: comply with, adhere to, observe, follow, obey, conform to
   
   **Antonyms**: violate, break, disregard, flout, defy
   
   **When to Use**: Rules, agreements, decisions, laws; emphasizing acceptance and commitment to follow
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing passive compliance without agreement, casual contexts (use "follow")
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - abide by the rules (standard collocation)
   - abide by a decision (accepting authority)
   - refuse to abide by (negative form)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal verb*: "Abide" alone means "remain/dwell." Adding "by" creates a completely different meaning - "to stand by and accept." This phrasal verb emerged in Middle English. The particle "by" indicates position (standing beside) which metaphorically means accepting and following. *Abide to or *abide with have different meanings entirely.
   
   **Root Analysis**: abide (remain, endure) + by (preposition/particle)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - If you're going to play, you have to abide by the rules.
   - I don't agree with the decision, but I'll abide by it.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All parties must abide by the terms stipulated in the contractual agreement.
   - Members are expected to abide by the professional code of conduct.

1. **Expression**: consistent with (type: adjective + preposition collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In agreement or harmony with; not contradicting; in accordance with
   - *Fixedness*: strong (dependent preposition - "consistent" requires "with")
   
   **Synonyms**: in line with, in accordance with, compatible with, concordant with, agreeing with
   
   **Antonyms**: inconsistent with, contrary to, at odds with, contradicting
   
   **When to Use**: Academic writing, research contexts, policy analysis, showing logical coherence, professional reports
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Very casual conversation, when stricter compliance language needed
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - consistent with findings (research contexts)
   - consistent with policy (organizational contexts)
   - consistent with principles (philosophical contexts)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Consistent" from Latin consistere (to stand together). The preposition "with" is grammatically required to show what something is consistent WITH. *Consistent to or *consistent for are ungrammatical. The "with" indicates accompaniment/agreement, creating meaning of standing together in harmony.
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + sistere (to stand) + -ent (adjective) + with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Your story isn't consistent with what you told me yesterday.
   - That's consistent with my experience.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The experimental results are consistent with established theoretical predictions.

   - pursuant to the terms of (contracts)
   - pursuant to authority granted (official actions)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal preposition*: From French poursuir (to pursue, follow). "Pursuant to" became the standardized legal formula for citing authority. The phrase has been fossilized in legal language since the 16th century. Alternative prepositions (*pursuant with, *pursuant by) are ungrammatical in this legal register - "to" is required.
   
   **Root Analysis**: pursue (follow) + -ant (adjective) + to (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Not used in casual contexts - exclusively formal/legal]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Pursuant to Section 12(a) of the Securities Act, quarterly reports must be filed within 45 days.
   - This action is taken pursuant to authority vested in the Administrator by statute.

   - in full conformity with (complete compliance)
   - in strict conformity with (rigorous adherence)
   - in substantial conformity with (mostly compliant)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For phrasal preposition*: "Conformity" from Latin conformitas (similarity of form). The phrase "in conformity with" became standardized in regulatory and technical language for expressing compliance with standards. "In" indicates state/condition, "with" shows what is being matched. Alternative constructions (*by conformity with) don't occur - this is the fixed form.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (preposition) + con- (together) + form (shape) + -ity (noun suffix) + with (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Rarely used casually - too formal]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The manufacturing process operates in conformity with ISO 9001 standards.
   - All procedures were conducted in conformity with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
