   **Meaning**: 
   - An organised set of actions (talks, posters, workshops, policies) designed to prevent and act against bullying, especially in schools or workplaces.

   **Antonyms**: (no direct positive opposite; loosely) tolerance of bullying, culture of bullying
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about structured efforts that clearly stand *against* bullying as a social problem.

   - anti-bullying policy
   - anti-bullying week
   - national anti-bullying campaign
   - school-wide anti-bullying programme
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Anti-bullying" captures strong moral opposition to bullying, while "campaign" implies coordinated, repeated action.

   - anti‑vaccine narratives

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Anti‑vaccine" locks in the "against" meaning, and "movement" frames it as organised social or political activity.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The anti‑vax movement is really active on social media.
