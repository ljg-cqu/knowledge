   **When NOT to Use**: For physical contact or movement (use 'against', 'toward', 'into'); for time expressions (use 'before', 'by', 'until'); in very formal legal or academic writing where full phrases like 'opposed to' or 'in opposition to' are clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases / noun phrases**: anti-war protest, anti-government movement, anti-smoking campaign, anti-racism training, anti-bullying policy

   - **Noun + prep**: anti-[N] stance, anti-[N] position, wave of anti-[group] feeling
   
   **Root Analysis**: anti- (Greek prefix meaning 'against, opposed to, opposite') + [base noun] (war, corruption, racism, etc.)
   
   **Etymology**: From Greek 'anti' ('against, opposite, instead of') → Latin 'anti-' → French/English bound prefix; in modern English it also appears as a free-form element before nouns (anti war politics, strongly anti vaccine) in informal and journalistic registers.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - A lot of people here are really anti social media now.
   - She's pretty anti exams and prefers project-based assessment.

   **Synonyms**: protective against, preventive, counter-, protective, defensive
   
   **Antonyms**: pro- (as in 'pro-coagulant', 'pro-inflammatory'), promoting, facilitating, enabling
   
   **When to Use**: In technical, medical, scientific, and product contexts where the idea of protection or counteraction is central (anti-cancer therapy, anti-fraud controls, anti-theft lock, anti-aging cream).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For simple ideological opposition where a full phrase like 'opposed to' is clearer; when the word is unfamiliar to your audience (prefer 'drug that prevents inflammation' over 'anti-inflammatory' for low-literacy readers).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases / compounds**: anti-virus software, anti-lock brakes, anti-theft system, anti-fraud checks, anti-icing coating

   - **Noun + prep**: anti-[N] treatment, anti-[N] policy, anti-[N] campaign
   
   **Root Analysis**: anti- (against) + [problem noun] (virus, theft, fraud, corrosion, inflammation) → compound meaning 'against X' or 'counteracting X'
   
   **Etymology**: Scientific and technical use of anti- as a combining form expanded in the 19th–20th centuries with chemistry, medicine, and engineering (anti-coagulant, anti-corrosion, anti-icing), preserving the core sense 'working against'.

   **When to Use**: In political commentary, journalism, and informal discussion when referring to groups or individuals primarily by what they are against (the anti-abortion lobby, anti-surveillance activists, anti-war protesters).
