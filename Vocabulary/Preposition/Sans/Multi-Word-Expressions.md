1. **Expression**: sans serif (type: collocation/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A style of typeface that does not have small projecting strokes ('serifs') at the ends of letters; literally 'without serifs'.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (technical term in typography; the two words almost always appear together in this sense).
   
   **Synonyms**: serif‑less typeface, grotesk (historical term), gothics (historical), modern geometric fonts
   
   **Antonyms**: serif typeface, slab serif, old‑style serif
   
   **When to Use**: Use in design, branding, and UI discussions when describing clean, modern, *sans‑ornament* fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, Roboto, or Inter. Common in conversations about readability, tone, and screen legibility.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it as a fancy synonym for 'font' in general; it specifically contrasts with serif typefaces.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - sans‑serif (hyphenated adjective)
   - humanist sans serif
   - geometric sans serif
   - grotesque sans serif
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The French word *sans* ('without') combines with the specialist term *serif* to form a compact, widely adopted label for a whole family of minimalist typefaces.
   
   **Root Analysis**: sans (French 'without') + serif (print term for decorative stroke on letters)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I prefer clean sans serif fonts in apps—no tiny decorative bits.
   - The poster uses a big sans serif headline for that modern, sans‑nonsense feel.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A sans serif typeface typically improves legibility on low‑resolution screens.
   - The report standardises on a humanist sans serif family to balance readability and visual restraint.

2. **Expression**: coffee sans sugar (type: collocation/pattern)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A playful way of saying 'coffee without sugar'; highlights a deliberate omission, often linked to taste, health, or simplicity.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (the pattern '[drink/food] sans [ingredient]' is flexible, though 'coffee sans sugar' is a common example).
   
   **Synonyms**: coffee without sugar, black coffee (if also without milk), coffee unsweetened
   
   **Antonyms**: coffee with sugar, sweetened coffee, coffee with syrup
   
   **When to Use**: Use in informal or semi‑playful contexts—cafés, food writing, conversations about habits. The *sans* framing often suggests intentional simplicity or discipline.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal menus or medical contexts where plain 'without sugar' is clearer; the French borrowing may distract some readers.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - tea sans sugar
   - latte sans syrup
   - dessert sans added sugar
   - cocktails sans alcohol
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Food and drink are natural domains for highlighting what has been removed—sugar, dairy, gluten. 'Sans' adds a slightly stylish, shorthand feel compared with 'without'.
   
   **Root Analysis**: coffee (drink) + sans ('without') + sugar (sweetener)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Just coffee sans sugar for me—I like it strong.
   - She's been doing breakfast sans sugar for a month and feels better.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were instructed to consume coffee sans sugar or sweeteners during the trial period.
   - A menu that clearly labels options such as 'coffee sans sugar' supports guests monitoring their intake.

3. **Expression**: design sans ornament (type: fixed phrase/critical formula)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Design that intentionally avoids decorative elements and focuses on structure, function, and clear form; a 'without ornamentation' approach.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (used as a repeatable critical formula in design writing).
   
   **Synonyms**: unadorned design, stripped‑down design, austere design, ornament‑free design
   
   **Antonyms**: highly ornate design, decorative design, embellished design
   
   **When to Use**: Use in design critiques, architecture reviews, and product discussions where the absence of ornament is a defining choice.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when decorations serve functional roles (for example, safety markings) or when cultural expectations value ornament; in those cases, 'sans ornament' can sound like a flaw.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - architecture sans ornament
   - UI sans ornament
   - typography sans ornament
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The phrase echoes movements like 'Ornament and Crime' in architecture and resonates with minimalist, *sans serif* aesthetics—signalling a principled stance against decorative excess.
   
   **Root Analysis**: design (plan, visual system) + sans ('without') + ornament (decorative element)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new logo is just text, design sans ornament—and I kind of like it.
   - Their whole brand is design sans ornament: plain packaging, clear labels, no fluff.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The building exemplifies design sans ornament, relying on proportion, light, and material to create interest.
   - A design‑sans‑ornament approach can sharpen focus on core interactions in digital products.

4. **Expression**: content sans context (type: fixed phrase/critical formula)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Information presented without the background, framing, or explanation needed to interpret it correctly.
   - *Fixedness*: medium to strong in analytic and media‑critique writing.
   
   **Synonyms**: decontextualised content, context‑free data, isolated facts
   
   **Antonyms**: context‑rich content, well‑framed information, fully contextualised data
   
   **When to Use**: Use when criticising dashboards, articles, or social posts that throw numbers or quotes at people *sans* the story, source, or boundaries needed for sound judgement.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when brevity is the whole point (for example, quick alerts); not every short message is 'content sans context'.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - data sans context
   - metrics sans context
   - screenshots sans context
   - quotes sans context
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Pairing 'content' with 'sans context' neatly names a common failure pattern in modern information environments.
   
   **Root Analysis**: content (information) + sans ('without') + context (surrounding conditions)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Please don't share that chart content sans context—it invites misreadings.
   - Social media is full of outrage posts based on content sans context.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Dashboards that surface content sans context increase the risk of hasty, ill‑informed decisions.
   - Evaluation metrics presented sans context can unintentionally distort stakeholder priorities.

5. **Expression**: life sans clutter (type: collocation/slogan)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A lifestyle concept focused on owning and doing less so that time, space, and attention are freed for what matters.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (used in slogans, book titles, and lifestyle branding).
   
   **Synonyms**: clutter‑free living, simplified life, intentional living, life with less
   
   **Antonyms**: overstuffed life, cluttered life, overcommitted life
   
   **When to Use**: Use in lifestyle, productivity, and self‑help contexts when talking about 'sans excess' living—fewer possessions, fewer obligations, fewer digital distractions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid trivialising serious constraints (poverty, forced downsizing) by romanticising 'life sans clutter'; be sensitive to context.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - calendar sans clutter
   - inbox sans clutter
   - home sans clutter
   - mind sans clutter
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The slogan‑like phrasing pairs an everyday noun ('life') with the stylish *sans* to frame reduction as a positive, chosen identity rather than deprivation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: life (overall way of living) + sans ('without') + clutter (mess, overload)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm aiming for a life sans clutter—fewer apps, fewer clothes, fewer random meetings.
   - Their brand sells the idea of life sans clutter: clean lines, neutral colours, empty counters.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - Designing default experiences that support a life sans digital clutter can reduce cognitive strain.
