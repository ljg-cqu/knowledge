1. **Adverb**: sparingly (type: manner/degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that uses only a small amount; only when necessary and not often.
   
   **Synonyms**: minimally, lightly, economically, modestly, frugally
   
   **Antonyms**: generously, heavily, excessively, lavishly, abundantly
   
   **When to Use**: Use when recommending 'sans excess'—for colour, animations, effects, adjectives, or features. Common in style guides and design feedback.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the context needs abundance or enthusiasm (for example, praise or emotional support); *sparingly* can sound restrictive.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - use colour sparingly
   - apply effects sparingly
   - speak sparingly
   - edit sparingly
   - use emojis sparingly
   
   **Root Analysis**: spare (thin, scant) + -ingly (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English 'spǣr' (sparing, frugal); adverb form 'sparingly' widely used in recipes, design, and advice.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Use animations sparingly—just enough to guide attention, not to show off.
   - I only check social media sparingly now, and my brain feels less crowded.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

2. **Adverb**: minimally (type: degree)

   **Antonyms**: maximally, extensively, substantially, significantly
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to stress that something has been designed or changed in a 'sans‑extras' manner—minimal impact, minimal interface, minimal disruption.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when real impact is large; calling large changes 'minimally disruptive' can damage trust.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - minimally invasive
   - minimally disruptive
   - minimally styled
   - minimally configured
   - minimally sufficient
   
   **Root Analysis**: minimal (very small in amount) + -ly (in a manner)

   **Examples [Formal]**:

3. **Adverb**: deliberately (type: manner)
   **Meaning**:

   **Antonyms**: accidentally, unintentionally, randomly, by chance
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasising that omissions, whitespace, or simple choices are intentional, not careless—'sans ornament' by design.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in apologies where you need to stress that harm was not intended; 'deliberately' can sound accusatory.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - deliberately simple
   - deliberately sparse
   - deliberately left out
   - deliberately restrained
   - deliberately minimal
   
   **Root Analysis**: deliberate (done on purpose) + -ly (in a manner)

   **When to Use**: Use when praising solutions, designs, or explanations that achieve a lot with a little—*sans fuss*, but still impressive.
