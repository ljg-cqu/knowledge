1. **Preposition**: sans (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Used mainly in written or stylistic English to mean "without"—showing that someone or something does not have, include, or show another thing.
   - *(Abstract – stylistic)* Often signals a deliberate or noticeable omission, especially in food, fashion, design, or rhetorical descriptions (for example, *burger sans onions*, *life sans regrets*).
   
   **Synonyms**: without, lacking, minus, free of, devoid of (formal), absent (from literary contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: with, including, complete with, along with
   
   **When to Use**: Use *sans* when you want a concise, slightly playful or literary alternative to *without*, especially in headlines, reviews, menus, branding, and commentary that highlights what has been left out. It fits best in written or semi-formal/creative registers, and in short noun phrases rather than complex clauses.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid *sans* in very formal legal or academic writing where *without* or *in the absence of* is clearer; do not use it in basic learner texts where the French borrowing might distract; avoid overusing it in the same paragraph, which can sound affected.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: sans sugar, sans makeup, sans context, sans explanation, sans regret, sans filter
   - **Noun + sans + noun**: burger sans onions, plan sans details, design sans ornament, life sans regrets, world sans borders
   - **Appositive pattern**: X, sans Y, Z → *A modern curriculum, sans unnecessary jargon, helps learners focus.*
   - **Headline / tagline uses**: "Comfort sans clutter", "Luxury sans guilt", "Data sans drama"
   
   **Root Analysis**: French *sans* (without) ← Latin *sine* (without)
   
   **Etymology**: Borrowed from Old French *sans* "without" (from Latin *sine*) into Middle English, where it survives mainly in fixed expressions and stylistic use. In modern English it is felt as a slightly playful or literary alternative to *without*, especially productive in advertising and design language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I ordered my burger sans onions this time—my stomach can't handle them.
   - She showed up to the meeting sans laptop and just took notes on her phone.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The exhibition explores urban life sans the usual romantic filter found in tourist brochures.
   - A policy framework sans credible enforcement mechanisms quickly loses its deterrent power.

2. **Preposition**: sans (in compressed written style) (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract – compressed)* Used in concise written phrases (especially headlines, labels, captions) to mean "without" in a compact, almost formula-like way.
   
   **Synonyms**: without, minus, free of, devoid of, absent (from)
   
   **Antonyms**: with, plus, featuring, complete with
   
   **When to Use**: Use *sans* in short noun phrases where space and punch matter—slides, captions, product labels, UX copy, and note-taking. It works well before a single concrete or abstract noun (*sans ads*, *sans commentary*, *sans spoilers*). Readers are expected to infer the full clause from the compressed phrase.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not mix compressed *sans* phrases with full formal sentences in the same clause (for example, avoid *The report is sans clear methods* in academic prose; prefer *The report is without clear methods*). Avoid using *sans* repeatedly in serious policy or legal documents, where it may undercut perceived seriousness.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Labels & captions**: report (draft, sans figures), export (sans metadata), summary (sans examples)
   - **UI / UX copy**: reading mode – sans ads, download – sans tracking, view – sans comments
   - **Review shorthand**: romance sans cliché, action sans plot, design sans usability
   - **Noun stacks**: metrics sans context, numbers sans narrative, rules sans explanation
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as above – French *sans* "without" used as a compact stylistic operator.
   
   **Etymology**: Same borrowing as above; the compact, note-like usage is reinforced by headlines, technical labels, and slide titles that favour short, high-impact wording.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I just want a clean reading view—news sans pop‑ups and autoplay videos.
   - Let's keep this version of the slide deck sans animations so it loads fast.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The baseline scenario is presented sans policy intervention to clarify the counterfactual.
   - An index value sans clear methodological notes risks being misinterpreted by non-specialists.
