1. **Functional Expression**: [X], but sans the [unwanted element] (function: evaluating/recommending a simplified alternative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A way to praise or recommend something while highlighting that a typical downside has been removed; communicates "like X, but without Y".
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: indirect compliment and contrast (softened by humour/style)
   
   **Synonyms**: [X] without the usual [Y], [X] minus the [annoyance], the good parts of [X] without [Y], [X] with none of the [problem]
   
   **Antonyms**: [X] with all the usual [problems], [X] plus extra [baggage], [X] complete with [unwanted element]
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to recommend a cleaner, calmer, or more focused version of something: *email, but sans reply‑all drama*; *analytics, but sans noisy dashboards*; *coffee, but sans sugar*.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal documents (contracts, academic papers); the French *sans* sounds playful. Do not use it where the "unwanted" element is actually required (for example, *security* or *legal review*).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "It's [X], just sans the [pain point]."
   - "Think [X], but sans the [friction]."
   - "[X] experience, sans the [clutter]."
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Combines positive politeness (shared appreciation of X) with gentle criticism of Y. Useful in product pitches, reviews, and informal design discussions; positions the speaker as on the listener's side against a shared annoyance.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "That sounds ideal." (accepting recommendation)
   - "So basically X without Y?" (clarifying)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's like a full project management tool, but sans the endless notification spam.
   - Think of it as email, but sans the huge signature blocks and reply‑all chains.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposal retains the strengths of traditional reporting, albeit sans the redundant status sections.
   - This workflow delivers the reach of broadcast communication, but sans the coordination overhead typically associated with town‑hall formats.

2. **Functional Expression**: Keep it [adjective]—[artifact] sans [clutter/jargon/ornament] (function: recommending a minimalist choice)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A directive formula used to advise others to choose a simple, uncluttered version of something; promotes "sans clutter" or "sans jargon" options.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct instruction, softened by framing it as style guidance
   
   **Synonyms**: keep it simple, go with the clean version, drop the extras, strip out the clutter, leave out the jargon
   
   **Antonyms**: load it up with detail, make it more elaborate, add more features, make it fancier
   
   **When to Use**: Use in internal design reviews, writing feedback, and planning sessions when you want a focused result: *Keep it clean—UI sans pop‑ups*; *Keep it clear—copy sans buzzwords*; *Keep it calm—screens sans flashing badges*.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid where legal, safety, or scientific accuracy requires full detail; a "sans details" approach can be dangerous in those domains. Also avoid using it as a blanket rule that erases necessary nuance.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Keep it clean—forms sans decorative backgrounds.
   - Keep it direct—emails sans long warm‑up paragraphs.
   - Keep it light—slides sans dense bullet lists.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Creates a memorable team shorthand. Encodes a shared value of simplicity without needing long explanations. Works well in cultures that value brevity and visual calm.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Got it, we’ll strip it back." (accepting guidance)
   - "How clean is too clean for this audience?" (probing constraints)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Keep it clean—deck sans animations and sound effects.
   - Keep it honest—status updates sans spin.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - For senior stakeholders, keep it concise—briefing notes sans implementation‑level detail.
   - On the landing page, keep it focused—hero section sans secondary calls‑to‑action.

3. **Functional Expression**: It's [X], just sans [Y] (function: comparing variants and setting expectations)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A way to explain a simplified or lighter version of something by referencing a fuller version and naming what is missing.
   - *Formality*: informal
   - *Directness*: direct comparison
   
   **Synonyms**: it's basically X without Y, it's X minus Y, it's X but we've taken Y out
   
   **Antonyms**: it's X plus Y, it's X with extra Y, it's X with Y added back in
   
   **When to Use**: Use in product demos, onboarding, or team communication: *It's our standard plan, just sans analytics*; *It's the usual workflow, just sans the weekly meeting*; *It's Markdown, just sans all the complex extensions*.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in legal descriptions or contracts where you must specify all differences precisely; the pattern is too informal for regulatory texts.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - "It's [tool], just sans all the social features."
   - "It's the full report, just sans appendices."
   - "It's our normal process, just sans the last review step for pilots."
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Leverages the listener's existing mental model of X; they only need to update by subtracting Y. Efficient for communication when differences are small and carefully chosen.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Okay, so we lose Y but keep everything else?" (confirming scope)
   - "That works—we don’t rely on Y much anyway." (accepting trade‑off)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It’s our usual weekly check‑in, just sans slides this time.
   - It’s basically Instagram, just sans the endless recommendations.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The pilot environment is the production stack, just sans certain non‑critical integrations.
   - The summary version is the full report, just sans methodological appendices and raw tables.

4. **Functional Expression**: I prefer [X] sans [Y] (function: expressing preference for a simpler/cleaner option)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formula for politely stating that you favour a version of something without a particular feature, flavour, or embellishment.
   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct preference statement framed as personal taste
   
   **Synonyms**: I like X without Y, I’d rather have X without Y, my preference is X minus Y, I’m happier with X without the Y
   
   **Antonyms**: I prefer X with Y, I like X plus Y, I want all the extras, I’d miss Y
   
   **When to Use**: Use in design discussions, ordering food/drinks, or configuring tools: *I prefer coffee sans sugar*; *I prefer dashboards sans 3D effects*; *I prefer notifications sans sound*.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid where Y is non‑negotiable for others (for example, legal text, accessibility features). Be careful not to frame others' preferences as inferior; keep the "I" focus.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I’m happier with [X] sans [Y].
   - Personally, I prefer [X] sans [Y].
   - For this audience, I’d go with [X] sans [Y].
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Frames the simplification as subjective, not a universal rule. Helpful in negotiation: others can counter with their own preferences without losing face.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - "Same here, that feels calmer." (alignment)
   - "For this client, though, Y might be important." (balancing preference with context)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I prefer interfaces sans pop‑ups—it feels a lot less stressful.
   - I prefer coffee sans sugar now; you really taste the beans.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - For internal dashboards, we prefer visualisations sans decorative effects that do not add informational value.
   - Many users report preferring sign‑in flows sans mandatory phone‑number collection.
