   **Antonyms**: ornate, elaborate, cluttered, busy, baroque

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - minimalist design
   - minimalist wardrobe

   - minimalist lifestyle
   
   **Root Analysis**: minimal (smallest amount) + -ist (adherent to a style or movement)

   - uncluttered layout

   - uncluttered writing

   **Antonyms**: dense, rich, crowded, abundant, packed

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - sparse layout
   - sparse text
   - sparse arrangement
   - sparse decoration
   - sparse interface
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin 'sparsus' (scattered, spread thin)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - bare‑bones interface
   - bare‑bones budget
   - bare‑bones version
   - bare‑bones MVP
   - bare‑bones accommodation
   
   **Root Analysis**: bare (without covering) + bones (basic structure)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - clean layout
   - clean typography
   - clean interface
   - clean lines
   - clean aesthetic
   
   **Root Analysis**: clean (free from dirt) → extended metaphorically to 'free from visual or structural mess'

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new website looks so clean—just text and images, sans weird effects.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stripped‑down version
