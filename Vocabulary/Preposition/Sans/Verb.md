   **When to Use**: Use when talking about editing text, simplifying designs, shrinking feature sets, or reducing commitments. Strongly associated with a 'sans clutter' or 'sans extras' approach.

   - pare down the design

   - declutter your workspace

   - declutter your schedule

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - streamline the process
   - streamline onboarding
   - streamline the workflow
   - streamline the interface
   - highly streamlined experience
   
   **Root Analysis**: stream (smooth, continuous flow) + line (shape) → shaped for smooth flow
