1. **Original Expression**: "clean design, sans clutter"  
   **Context**: Describing visual or interface design that intentionally removes non‑essential elements
   
   **Core Intent**: To praise a design choice that keeps only essentials and deliberately omits visual noise or decoration.
   
   **Casual**: "It looks really clean, with no clutter at all."  
   *Characteristics*: Everyday vocabulary ("really clean"), simple negation ("no clutter"), relaxed tone  
   *Use when*: Chatting with teammates, giving quick feedback to friends, informal design discussions
   
   **Semi-Formal**: "The design is clean and largely free of visual clutter."  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral professional vocabulary ("visual clutter"), complete sentence, objective tone  
   *Use when*: Design reviews, handover notes, stakeholder emails, documentation
   
   **Formal**: "The interface exhibits a restrained, minimalist aesthetic, largely devoid of extraneous visual elements."  
   *Characteristics*: Elevated adjectives ("restrained, minimalist"), formal noun phrase ("extraneous visual elements"), hedging ("largely")  
   *Use when*: Design specifications, reports, academic or conference papers on UX/UI
   
   **Humorous**: "It's design on a diet—sans all the visual junk food."  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor ("on a diet," "junk food"), playful exaggeration, informal register  
   *Use when*: Light presentations, team retros, blog posts with a friendly tone  
   *Avoid when*: Formal client reports, cross‑cultural settings where food metaphors may not land
   
   **Lively**: "Clean, focused, and easy on the eyes—design sans clutter that lets the content breathe!"  
   *Characteristics*: Triplet structure ("clean, focused, easy"), exclamation, vivid metaphor ("lets the content breathe")  
   *Use when*: Pitch decks, product tours, marketing copy where enthusiasm is welcome
   
   **Empathetic**: "A calm, uncluttered design that respects users' attention by staying sans distractions."  
   *Characteristics*: User‑centred framing ("respects users' attention"), emotionally aware adjective ("calm"), gentle tone  
   *Use when*: UX principles documents, accessibility discussions, advocating for user wellbeing
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal variant for C‑level or external reports; casual/lively variants for peers or design‑savvy audiences.
   - *Social Distance*: With new clients, prefer semi‑formal; with long‑term partners, humorous/lively may be acceptable.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For serious accessibility or safety issues, avoid humour—use formal or empathetic phrasing.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures value ornate visuals; emphasise benefits (clarity, ease) rather than implying their current style is "junk food".
   - *Medium*: Written reports favour semi‑formal/formal; live talks and blogs can lean on lively or humorous tones.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Overusing *sans* in place of "without" in very formal documents—can sound affected or trendy.
   - Praising "clean" design when essential cues have been removed (users experience it as confusing, not calm).
   - Equating any empty space with quality; true "design sans clutter" is intentional, not just unfinished.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: Minimalist, clutter‑free design is strongly associated with certain brands and design cultures (for example, Scandinavian, Japanese, or tech‑product aesthetics). In more decorative traditions, "sans clutter" may need to be framed as "easier to scan" or "lighter on attention" instead of implicitly criticising ornament.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal design critique → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal ("clean and largely free of visual clutter") to balance clarity and collegial tone.
   - **Situation 2**: UX case study for conference → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("restrained, minimalist aesthetic, largely devoid of extraneous visual elements").
   - **Situation 3**: Product launch blog post → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively ("design sans clutter that lets the content breathe!") to engage readers.

2. **Original Expression**: "coffee sans sugar"  
   **Context**: Ordering or describing coffee with no sugar as a deliberate preference
   
   **Core Intent**: To state a preference for an un‑sweetened, simpler version of a familiar item.
   
   **Casual**: "Coffee, no sugar, thanks."  
   *Characteristics*: Short clause, direct request, everyday vocabulary  
   *Use when*: Ordering in casual cafés, talking to friends, noting habits
   
   **Semi-Formal**: "I'd like my coffee without sugar, please."  
   *Characteristics*: Polite modal ("I'd like"), explicit preposition ("without"), polite closing ("please")  
   *Use when*: Standard customer–staff interactions, polite workplace settings
   
   **Formal**: "I take my coffee without sugar."  
   *Characteristics*: Timeless present tense ("I take"), neutral tone, no slang  
   *Use when*: Professional small talk, written preferences (event forms, surveys)
   
   **Humorous**: "Coffee, hold the sugar—I need it as bitter as my deadlines."  
   *Characteristics*: Hyperbole, humorous comparison, informal idiom ("hold the sugar")  
   *Use when*: Friendly work chats, informal talks, social media posts  
   *Avoid when*: With people who may find self‑deprecating humour confusing or inappropriate
   
   **Lively**: "Just straight coffee—no sugar, no syrup, no nonsense!"  
   *Characteristics*: Repetition with rhythm, emphatic negatives, exclamation mark  
   *Use when*: Marketing copy, personal blogs, energetic conversations
   
   **Empathetic**: "If you're cutting back on sugar, we can do your coffee without any."  
   *Characteristics*: Second‑person focus, supportive framing ("we can"), acknowledging effort  
   *Use when*: Hosting guests, supporting dietary changes, health‑focused contexts
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With service staff in formal venues, prefer semi‑formal requests; humorous lines may not translate.
   - *Social Distance*: Casual lines fit close friends; semi‑formal and empathetic work better with acquaintances.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If sugar restriction is medical, avoid jokes—use empathetic or formal wording.
   - *Cultural Context*: Sugar defaults and expectations vary; in some places, coffee arrives pre‑sweetened—be extra clear.
   - *Medium*: Spoken orders favour brief, clear requests; written preferences (forms) favour formal/semi‑formal phrasing.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Relying on *sans sugar* with staff who may not recognise the French borrowing—"no sugar" is safer.
   - Using jokey comparisons about bitterness in sensitive health contexts.
   - Being vague ("Make it light") when you actually mean "without sugar".
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, refusing sugar can be read as rejecting hospitality; softening with appreciation ("Thank you, just without sugar") can help maintain rapport.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Business meeting at a café → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal ("I'd like my coffee without sugar, please.").
   - **Situation 2**: Chat with a close colleague → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual or Humorous ("Coffee, no sugar" / "as bitter as my deadlines").
   - **Situation 3**: Health‑coaching session → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic (supportive framing of "without any").

3. **Original Expression**: "data sans context"  
   **Context**: Criticising information that is presented without enough background to interpret it safely
   
   **Core Intent**: To warn that raw numbers or snippets, presented without framing or explanation, are misleading or incomplete.
   
   **Casual**: "These numbers on their own are just data with no context."  
   *Characteristics*: Plain words ("numbers," "on their own"), straightforward criticism  
   *Use when*: Team stand‑ups, casual reviews of dashboards, talking through slides
   
   **Semi-Formal**: "The data is being presented without sufficient context for meaningful interpretation."  
   *Characteristics*: Professional vocabulary ("sufficient," "meaningful interpretation"), impersonal tone  
   *Use when*: Internal reports, retrospectives, stakeholder meetings
   
   **Formal**: "The dataset is largely devoid of contextual information, which significantly constrains valid inference."  
   *Characteristics*: Formal noun phrases ("dataset," "contextual information"), precise verbs ("constrains"), hedging adverb ("largely")  
   *Use when*: Academic articles, risk analyses, governance documents
   
   **Humorous**: "Pure data, zero context—like a plot twist with no movie."  
   *Characteristics*: Analogy to storytelling, playful exaggeration, informal style  
   *Use when*: Talks, workshops, blog posts where humour helps engagement  
   *Avoid when*: Communicating about high‑stakes risk or public safety
   
   **Lively**: "Numbers everywhere, context nowhere—that's a fast track to bad decisions."  
   *Characteristics*: Parallelism ("everywhere / nowhere"), emotive phrase ("fast track"), energetic warning  
   *Use when*: Team briefings, training sessions, persuasive internal talks
   
   **Empathetic**: "It’s hard to make sound decisions when data comes without enough context; let’s add the missing pieces."  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges difficulty, inclusive "let’s," supportive problem‑solving tone  
   *Use when*: Coaching analysts, guiding non‑experts, improving cross‑functional communication
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Formal wording for board or regulatory reports; semi‑formal for managers; casual/lively for peer teams.
   - *Social Distance*: With unfamiliar stakeholders, avoid sarcasm; prefer semi‑formal or empathetic phrasing.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For safety, legal, or reputational risk, drop humour and use clear formal warnings.
   - *Cultural Context*: Direct criticism may be unwelcome in some cultures—frame as a shared improvement project ("we" instead of "you").
   - *Medium*: Written analyses favour formal/semi‑formal; workshops and talks can use lively or humorous lines sparingly.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using the stylish *sans* framing when the audience is unfamiliar with it—"without context" may be clearer.
   - Critiquing "data sans context" without proposing concrete fixes (source, timeframe, definitions).
   - Sounding dismissive of others' work rather than inviting collaboration on better framing.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In high‑context cultures, saying "there isn’t enough context" can subtly criticise leadership communication. Softening with shared responsibility ("we need more context") is often safer.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal analytics review → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal ("presented without sufficient context").
   - **Situation 2**: Public research report → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("devoid of contextual information").
   - **Situation 3**: Training session for new analysts → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively or Empathetic (engaging but respectful warning about "data sans context").
