1. **Linking Word**: along with (type: connector - addition/accompaniment)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce additional items, people, or information; indicates accompaniment or addition
   - *Function*: Adds supplementary information in a more formal way than simple "with"
   
   **Synonyms**: together with, in addition to, as well as, alongside, plus
   
   **Antonyms**: without, excluding, apart from, except for
   
   **When to Use**: Adding elements to lists, formal writing, emphasizing items grouped together; more formal than "with"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly formal in casual speech; simple "with" often sufficient
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Main item], along with [additional items], [verb]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence, introducing supplementary information
   - [Punctuation]: typically set off with commas when interrupting main clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Verb agreement—match verb to main subject, not items after "along with"
   
   **Root Analysis**: along (in company) + with (accompaniment)
