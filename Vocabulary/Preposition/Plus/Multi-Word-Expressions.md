1. **Expression**: plus or minus (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - used to indicate an approximate number, with a margin of error on either side
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: give or take, approximately, roughly, around, about
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, specifically
   
   **When to Use**: In scientific and mathematical contexts to express uncertainty or margin of error; in everyday speech to indicate approximate quantities; in informal and formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact precision is required; don't use in legal documents requiring specific amounts; avoid when the margin is asymmetrical (not equal on both sides)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - give or take
   - approximately
   - around [number]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: Mathematical convention pairing addition and subtraction operations to express range; "plus" and "minus" are natural opposites used together to indicate bidirectional deviation from a central value
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "plus" (more) + Latin "minus" (less)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'll be there in 20 minutes, plus or minus 5.
   - The box weighs 50 pounds, plus or minus.

   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: positive aspect, bright side, silver lining, advantage, benefit
   
   **Antonyms**: downside, negative aspect, drawback, disadvantage
   
   **When to Use**: In informal and semi-formal contexts when discussing advantages; when trying to identify positive aspects of challenging situations; in everyday conversation
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing (use "advantage" or "benefit"); don't use when discussing purely negative situations without positive aspects
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - on the plus side
   - the bright side
   - the positive side
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Plus" conventionally represents positive values in mathematics and general usage, naturally partnering with "side" to mean the favorable perspective or aspect; high frequency of co-occurrence in discussing balanced viewpoints
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "plus" (more) + Old English "side" (flank, region)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - On the plus side, at least we got some exercise!
   - The job is far away, but on the plus side, it pays really well.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

3. **Expression**: in addition to (type: phrasal preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - as well as; besides; along with; used to add extra information
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed)
   
   **Synonyms**: as well as, besides, along with, together with, plus

   **When to Use**: In formal and semi-formal writing when adding information; in academic contexts to introduce supplementary details; more formal than "plus"
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech (too formal); don't use when subtraction or exclusion is meant; avoid overuse which creates wordy sentences
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - plus
   - as well as
   - along with
   - together with
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Fixed prepositional phrase developed from combining "in" (location) + "addition" (adding) + "to" (direction) to create a grammaticalized expression meaning "besides" or "along with"; established usage since 16th century
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin in + Latin additionem + Old English to
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - In addition to pizza, we ordered some wings.
   - I play guitar, and in addition to that, I sing too.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: N/A - standard mathematical notation appropriate in all contexts requiring mathematical expression
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - A + B
   - A and B
   - the sum of A and B
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Universal mathematical notation established for centuries; "plus" functions as the standard operator for addition, positioned between operands (A and B) in infix notation
   
   **Root Analysis**: Variables + Latin "plus" (more)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - So if A plus B equals 10, what is A?
   - Just do 5 plus 3—that's your answer.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

5. **Expression**: plus point (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - a positive feature or advantage; an aspect that counts in favor of something
   - *Fixedness*: medium (preferred in certain contexts)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - strong point
   - positive point
   - advantage
   - benefit
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Plus" representing positive values combines with "point" (individual item or aspect) to create a collocation meaning favorable feature; emerged from scoring and evaluation contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "plus" (more) + Old French "point" (dot, item)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That's a real plus point for the apartment—free parking!

   - plus VAT
   - plus handling
   - plus delivery
   - excluding tax/shipping
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Commercial convention for transparent pricing; "plus" signals additional costs beyond stated price, partnering with standard fee types (tax, shipping, handling); established retail and e-commerce terminology
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin "plus" (more) + various (tax from Latin taxare; shipping from Old English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The laptop costs $500 plus tax.
   - It's $20 plus shipping—still a good deal!
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All prices are listed in US dollars plus applicable state taxes.

   - put in extra effort
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Root Analysis**: Old English "gan" (go) + Latin "extra" (beyond) + Latin "milia" (thousand paces = mile)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
