   **Antonyms**: temporarily, for now, for the time being
   
   **When to Use**: Use when emphasizing permanence of a decision, departure, or change, in contexts where finality needs to be stressed, when contrasting with temporary situations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the situation might actually be temporary or reversible, don't use in formal legal contexts where precise temporal language is required, avoid when "permanently" would be clearer.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - for good and all (emphatic version)
   - gone for good
   - left for good
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Good" historically meant "completely" or "fully" in certain contexts; the phrase evolved from Middle English meaning "completely and finally." The idiom emphasizes the totality and permanence of an action or state.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - for your sake
   - for my sake
   - for heaven's sake (emphatic/exasperated)
   - for the sake of argument (hypothetically)
   - for old times' sake (out of nostalgia)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Sake" comes from Old English "sacu" (dispute, cause, lawsuit), which evolved to mean "purpose" or "behalf." The phrase became fixed in Middle English as a way to express purpose or benefit. The word "sake" is now almost exclusively used in this phrase.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "for" (purpose) + "the" + "sake" (cause, purpose, benefit) + "of"

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the resolution might not actually be final, don't use when tentative solutions are being proposed, avoid overusing (loses impact), don't use when humility or openness to revision is appropriate.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - once for all (slightly archaic)
   - settle once and for all
   - decide once and for all
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Combines "once" (one time, single occurrence) with "for all" (for all time, comprehensively) to create emphatic expression of finality. The redundancy is intentional for emphasis. Emerged in English by the 16th century.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "once" (one time) + "and" + "for" (extent) + "all" (totality)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - for the present
   - for the moment
   - just for the time being
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Being" in philosophical and temporal sense means "existence" or "present state." The phrase emphasizes the transitory nature of the present moment. Dating from Middle English, it maintains formal/literary tone.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "for" (duration) + "the" + "time" + "being" (present existence)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm crashing on my friend's couch for the time being.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - to all intents and purposes (British variant)
   - for all practical purposes (simplified alternative)
   - ❌ for all intensive purposes (common error—incorrect!)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Legal phrase from English law, originally "to all intents, constructions, and purposes," meaning in every way the law could be interpreted or applied. Shortened over time to current form. Emphasizes comprehensive practical equivalence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "for" (regarding) + "all" + "intents" (purposes/intentions) + "and" + "purposes" (aims/goals)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They're not officially married, but for all intents and purposes, they're a couple. (sounds formal even in casual context)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - make it up to someone
   - make up for lost time
   - try to make up for
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Make up" as phrasal verb means "to complete" or "to compensate," combined with "for" indicating what is being compensated. The partnership is semantically natural—"make" suggests active creation, "up" suggests filling a gap, "for" indicates the deficiency addressed.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "make" (create, cause to exist) + "up" (to completeness) + "for" (in exchange for, to balance)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Sorry I missed your party—let me make it up to you with dinner.

   - look out for yourself (self-interest)
   - look out for number one (idiomatic: self-interest)
   - look out for each other
   - keep looking out for
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Look out" means to watch with attention or care, combined with "for" indicating the object of attention or care. Semantically natural partnership: direction of attention ("out") toward a beneficiary or target ("for"). Common in both protective and vigilant contexts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "look" (direct one's gaze/attention) + "out" (externally, with vigilance) + "for" (on behalf of, toward)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Thanks for looking out for me back there.

   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when simpler "mean," "represent," or "tolerate" would be clearer, avoid when multiple senses could cause confusion, don't confuse with "stand by" or "stand up for."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - won't stand for (negative: won't tolerate)
   - stand for something (have principles)
   - What does [abbreviation] stand for?
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Stand" suggests position or bearing, "for" indicates what that position represents or supports. Multiple meanings developed: (1) represent/symbolize, (2) tolerate/accept, (3) advocate/support. All share the idea of a relationship between the stander and what they stand for.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "stand" (take/maintain a position) + "for" (representing, in favor of, in place of)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - account for something (explain)
   - account for [percentage] (constitute)
   - held accountable for (related: responsibility)
   - cannot account for (cannot explain)

   - go for it (encouragement to try)
   - go for broke (risk everything)
   - that goes for [someone] too (applies to)
   - going for [price] (being sold)
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   - forecast calls for (weather)
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   - must allow for
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Allow" means to permit or make provision. Combined with "for," it indicates what is being accommodated or considered.

It signals that a statement should be documented and taken as formal/official. Dating from at least the 19th century in legal contexts.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - What's that for?
   - What did you do that for?
   - give someone what for (informal: punish/rebuke)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Interrogative formed by fronting "what" from phrase "for what [purpose/reason]." Common in informal speech. The punishment sense ("give what for") is older usage, now archaic or regional. The question usage remains current but informal.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "what" (interrogative pronoun) + "for" (purpose, reason)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - What did you bring that up for?
   - What's this button for?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - as for me
   - as for that
   - as for the rest
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Combines "as" (in the manner of, in respect to) with "for" (regarding). Functions as discourse marker to segment discussion into manageable topics. Common in both speech and writing for organizing complex discussions into components.
   
   **Root Analysis**: "as" (in respect to) + "for" (regarding)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As for the party, I'm not sure I can make it.
