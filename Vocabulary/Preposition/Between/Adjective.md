   **When to Use**: Use "in-between" as an adjective to describe states, sizes, categories, or positions that are neither one extreme nor another; appropriate in casual to semi-formal contexts; useful when emphasizing the liminal or transitional nature of something; often hyphenated when used attributively (before nouns).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in highly formal academic or technical writing where more precise terminology is expected; do not use when "intermediate" or "transitional" would be more professional; avoid when the intermediate status needs specific quantification rather than general categorization.
