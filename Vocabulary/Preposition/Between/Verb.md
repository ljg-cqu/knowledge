   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the switching is one-directional or permanent (use "switch to" or "change to"); do not confuse with "alternative" (noun/adjective); avoid when describing simultaneous occurrence rather than sequential alternation; note: commonly confused with "alternative" in spelling.

   **Root Analysis**: alter- (other, change) + -nate (verb suffix from Latin past participle) → "to make other by turns"
   
   **Etymology**: Latin alternatus (done by turns) → alternare (to do one thing and then another) → English "alternate" (16th century)
