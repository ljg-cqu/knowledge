   **Synonyms**: intermediate, middle ground, transition, halfway point
   
   **Antonyms**: extreme, endpoint, category, definitive type
   
   **When to Use**: Use "in-between" as a noun to refer to things, people, or states occupying intermediate positions; appropriate in casual to semi-formal contexts; common in animation terminology; useful when discussing categorical ambiguity or transitional states; typically hyphenated as noun.
