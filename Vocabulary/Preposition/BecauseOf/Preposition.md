1. **Preposition**: because of (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Causal)* Used to introduce the reason or cause for something; indicates that one thing is the result of another thing
   - *(Neutral Attribution)* Expresses causation without the positive/negative connotation that alternatives like "thanks to" might carry
   
   **Synonyms**: due to (formal context), owing to (formal context), on account of (formal), as a result of, by reason of (very formal)
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding, irrespective of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "because of" when expressing direct causation in both positive and negative contexts. It's neutral and versatile across all registers—casual conversation, professional communication, and academic writing. Particularly useful when stating objective causes or when you want to avoid the emotional tone of alternatives.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use before a finite clause (use "because" instead): "because of he arrived" ✗ vs "because he arrived" ✓. Avoid redundancy with other causal markers in the same sentence. In very formal academic writing, consider "due to" or "owing to" after the verb "to be."
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: because of [noun phrase], because of [this/that/the fact], because of [possessive pronoun + noun]
   - **Verb + prep**: happen because of, occur because of, fail because of, succeed because of, change because of
   - **Adjective + prep**: impossible because of, delayed because of, cancelled because of, possible because of
   - **Noun + prep**: delay because of, cancellation because of, failure because of, success because of
   
   **Root Analysis**: because (subordinating conjunction from by + cause) + of (preposition) = compound prepositional phrase
   
   **Etymology**: English → "because" from Middle English "bi cause" (by cause) + "of" (Old English "of"). The two-word phrase "because of" emerged to create a prepositional phrase that can introduce noun phrases, while "because" alone introduces clauses.
