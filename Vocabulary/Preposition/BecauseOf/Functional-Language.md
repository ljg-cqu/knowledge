1. **Functional Expression**: That's because... (function: explaining/justifying)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Formality*: informal to neutral
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: The reason is..., It's because..., This is due to..., This is on account of...
   
   **Antonyms**: Despite this..., Nevertheless..., However...

   **Common Variations**: 
   - That's mainly because...
   - That's largely because...
   - That's partly because...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Functions as a causal connector in discourse, allowing speakers to backtrack and provide explanation. Often used when the speaker realizes additional clarification is needed. Informal and conversational in nature.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, I see / I understand / That makes sense
   - Right, so... / Okay, so...

   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: What caused this is..., The explanation is..., This is because...
   
   **Antonyms**: Despite the fact that..., Regardless of...
   
   **When to Use**: Use across all registers when providing clear, structured explanations. Particularly common in formal presentations, academic writing, and professional communication. Emphasizes clarity and logical structure.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound redundant or wordy—avoid "The reason is because" (use "The reason is that" instead). Don't overuse in the same text as it becomes repetitive.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - The main reason is...
   - One reason is...
   - The primary reason is...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Provides explicit framing for causal explanations, making the logical structure transparent. Helps organize discourse and signals that a reason/explanation follows. Note: "The reason is because" is considered redundant by many style guides.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - I see / That makes sense / I understand
   - So basically... / In other words...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The reason I'm late is that traffic was terrible.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - This is mainly because...
   - This is largely because...
   - This is primarily because...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Serves as a cohesive device linking explanation to prior statement. Commonly used in academic discourse to make causal relationships explicit. Helps structure arguments and maintain logical flow.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - I understand / That explains it / I see
   - So that means... / In other words...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I love this restaurant. This is because the food is amazing.
   - He's always tired. This is because he doesn't sleep enough.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Antonyms**: Despite the fact that..., Although..., Even though...
   
   **When to Use**: Use sparingly in formal writing when emphasis on causation is needed. More common in business reports and formal correspondence. However, often considered wordy by style guides.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Generally avoid—"because" is clearer and more concise. Style guides typically recommend against this phrase. Avoid in academic writing where concision is valued.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - largely due to the fact that
   - primarily due to the fact that
   - owing to the fact that (equally wordy)
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Often criticized as unnecessarily wordy. Most style guides recommend replacing with "because," "since," or "given that." Use only when formality or rhythm requires the longer form.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - I see / I understand / That makes sense
   - So because of that... / Therefore...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used; too formal and wordy for casual speech)

   **Common Variations**: 
   - seeing as how (very informal, dialectal)
   - seeing that
   - seeing as
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Highly conversational and colloquial. Suggests shared knowledge or obvious circumstances. Often used when the reason should be apparent to both speaker and listener. More common in British English than American English.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Yeah, that makes sense / True / Fair enough
   - Right, so... / Okay then...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce reasons or contributing factors, especially when multiple causes are involved; informal causal expression
   - *Formality*: informal
   - *Directness*: indirect

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I've been so busy, what with work and the kids and everything.

1. **Functional Expression**: It stems from... / It comes from... (function: attributing origin/cause)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to identify the source, origin, or cause of something; explains where something originated
   - *Formality*: neutral ("stems from" more formal than "comes from")
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: It originates from..., It arises from..., It derives from..., It results from...
   
   **Antonyms**: It leads to..., It causes..., It produces...
   
   **When to Use**: Use when tracing causes back to their origins. "Stems from" is more formal and analytical; "comes from" is more casual and versatile. Common in explanatory discourse across registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "Comes from" can be ambiguous (origin vs. causation)—clarify context. "Stems from" may sound overly formal in very casual settings.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - largely stems from
   - primarily stems from
   - mainly comes from
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Stems from" emphasizes analytical tracing of causes to roots; "comes from" is more general and conversational. Both help organize causal explanations and make relationships explicit.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, I see / That makes sense / I didn't realize that
   - So basically... / So it's rooted in...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to acknowledge a circumstance or fact that serves as the basis for what follows; introduces accepted premises
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal (avoid "the fact that" for concision)
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: Considering that..., Since..., Because..., In light of the fact that...
   
   **Antonyms**: Despite the fact that..., Although..., Even though...
   
   **When to Use**: Use across registers when introducing accepted facts or circumstances as foundation for reasoning. Common in analytical and argumentative discourse. "Given that" is more concise than "given the fact that."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid "given the fact that"—wordy. In very formal writing, consider "because" or "since" for concision.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - given the circumstances
   - given the situation
   - given these factors
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Frames subsequent statement as logical consequence of accepted premises. Useful for constructing arguments and making reasoning transparent. "Given that" is preferred over "given the fact that" for concision.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Yes, that follows / That makes sense / I agree
   - So therefore... / So logically...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use when clarifying or correcting misconceptions about reasons or causes. Common in explanations, justifications, and conflict resolution. Helps manage face by negating wrong assumptions before providing accurate explanation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound defensive if overused. May be too indirect for situations requiring directness.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - It's not that I don't want to, it's that I can't
   - It's not about... it's about...
   - It isn't that... it's more that...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Face-saving strategy that softens correction of assumptions. Allows speaker to clarify actual reasons while protecting both parties' face. Common in situations where misunderstanding needs gentle correction.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Oh, I see / I understand / Sorry, I misunderstood
   - So it's more about... / So the real issue is...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It's not that I don't like him, it's that we don't have much in common.
