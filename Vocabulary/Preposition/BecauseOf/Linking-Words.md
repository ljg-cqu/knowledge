1. **Linking Word**: because of (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A prepositional phrase functioning as a causal connector that introduces the reason or cause for a situation, establishing clear cause-effect relationships
   - *Function*: Establishes cause-effect relationship between clauses or within sentences; introduces the cause while the main clause states the effect; neutral in tone
   
   **Synonyms**: due to, owing to, on account of, as a result of, by reason of, as a consequence of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding, even though, although
   
   **When to Use**: Use "because of" when explaining causation with noun phrases. Works effectively at sentence-initial position to emphasize the cause, or mid-sentence for natural flow. Appropriate for all registers from casual conversation to formal academic writing. Ideal when presenting objective cause-effect relationships without emotional connotation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid before finite verb clauses (use "because" alone instead). Don't combine with other causal connectors in the same clause as it creates redundancy. In formal academic prose after "to be," some style guides prefer "due to" over "because of." Avoid when listing multiple complex causes—consider using more elaborate causal constructions.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Because of X], [main clause effect]. OR [Main clause effect] [because of X].
   - **Position**: sentence-initial (emphasizes cause) / mid-sentence / sentence-final (emphasizes effect)
   - **Punctuation**: When sentence-initial, follow with comma: "Because of X, Y happened." When mid-sentence or sentence-final, comma optional depending on emphasis: "Y happened because of X." or "Y happened, because of X."
   - **Common errors to avoid**: Don't use with finite verb ("because of he was late" ✗); must follow with noun phrase ("because of his lateness" ✓). Avoid double causation: "The reason is because of X" ✗ (use "The reason is X" or "It happened because of X"). Don't confuse with "because": "because of raining" ✗ vs "because it was raining" ✓.
   
   **Root Analysis**: because (from by + cause) + of (preposition) = compound prepositional phrase functioning as causal connector
   
   **Etymology**: English → "because" from Middle English "bi cause" (by the cause of) + "of" (indicating origin/cause). Evolved as a prepositional phrase to introduce noun phrases as causes, complementing the conjunctive use of "because" alone with clauses.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm so tired because of all the late nights this week.
   - The game was cancelled because of the storm.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The project timeline was extended because of unforeseen technical complications.
   - Economic growth slowed significantly because of reduced consumer confidence and tightened credit conditions.
