1. **Verb**: cause
   **Meaning**: 
   - (transitive) To make something happen; to be the reason why something happens; to produce an effect or result
   
   **Synonyms**: bring about, lead to, result in, produce, generate
   
   **Antonyms**: prevent, stop, avoid, hinder, inhibit
   
   **When to Use**: Use in both formal and informal contexts when describing direct causation. Common in scientific writing, accident reports, problem analysis, and everyday explanations. Essential for expressing agency and responsibility.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in passive constructions where the agent is unclear or when emphasizing multiple contributing factors (use "contribute to" instead). Don't use when describing correlations without proven causation.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - cause problems, cause damage, cause concern
   - cause someone to do something, cause an accident, cause confusion
   - what caused [something], likely to cause, may cause
   
   **Root Analysis**: cause (from Latin causa = reason, purpose)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "causare" (to cause, plead) from "causa" (reason, cause) → Old French "causer" → Middle English "causen" (13th century). Always retained the meaning of "to bring about" or "to produce an effect."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The storm caused a lot of damage to our neighborhood.
   - Don't worry, you didn't cause any problems at all.

1. **Verb**: result (from/in)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (intransitive + from) To happen or exist because of something; to be caused by something
   - *(Sense 2)* (intransitive + in) To cause something to happen; to have a particular effect or outcome
   
   **Synonyms**: arise from, stem from, follow from, lead to, culminate in
   
   **Antonyms**: cause, originate, begin, initiate
   
   **When to Use**: Use "result from" when describing what something is caused by; use "result in" when describing what something causes. Common in formal analysis, academic writing, and reports. Emphasizes logical outcomes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid confusing the two prepositions: "result from" (X results from Y = Y causes X) vs "result in" (X results in Y = X causes Y). Don't use in highly technical contexts where more precise causal terminology is needed.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - result from circumstances, result from actions, result from factors
   - result in changes, result in consequences, result in outcomes
   - likely to result, may result, could result
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (back, again) + sult (from salire = to leap) = to leap back, rebound
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "resultare" (to spring back) → Medieval Latin (to result) → English (15th century). Originally meant physical rebound, evolved to mean "to follow as a consequence."

   **Synonyms**: result in, bring about, cause, produce, give rise to
   
   **Antonyms**: prevent, avoid, stop, forestall
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing processes or chains of events that produce outcomes. More dynamic than "cause" and implies a progression or pathway. Common across all registers but particularly useful in process descriptions and sequential causation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with the literal meaning of "guide" or "direct." Avoid when describing instant causation (use "cause" instead). Not appropriate when the causal relationship is uncertain.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - lead to problems, lead to success, lead to changes
   - may lead to, could lead to, will lead to
   - lead to the conclusion, lead to believe, lead someone to do something
   
   **Root Analysis**: lead (Old English lǣdan = to guide, bring)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "lǣdan" (to guide, conduct) → Middle English "leden" → Modern English "lead." The causal sense "to bring about" developed from the literal sense of "guiding" toward an outcome (14th century).

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when describing sole or primary causation (use "cause" instead). Don't use when you need to emphasize direct responsibility.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - contribute to success, contribute to problems, contribute to growth
   - contribute significantly to, contribute greatly to, contribute directly to
   - factors that contribute, contribute to the development, contribute to understanding
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (with, together) + tribute (from tribuere = to assign, grant) = to grant together

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stem from problems, stem from misunderstanding, stem from differences
   - largely stem from, primarily stem from, stem from the fact
   - issues that stem from, difficulties stem from
   
   **Root Analysis**: stem (Old Norse stemma = to stop, dam up; or Old English stefn = trunk, main part)
   
   **Etymology**: The causal sense derives from botanical "stem" (main support) → metaphorical use "to originate from" (as branches from a stem) → English (16th century).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Most of our arguments stem from simple misunderstandings.
   - His confidence problems stem from childhood experiences.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - trigger a reaction, trigger events, trigger changes
   - trigger a response, trigger an alarm, trigger memories
   - can trigger, may trigger, what triggered
   
   **Root Analysis**: trigger (from Dutch trekker = puller, from trekken = to pull)
   
   **Etymology**: Dutch "trekker" (device that pulls) → English "trigger" (firearm mechanism, 17th century) → metaphorical use "to cause to start" (19th century). Extended from mechanical sense to general causation.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That song always triggers memories of my college days.
   - Certain foods can trigger allergic reactions.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - produce results, produce effects, produce outcomes
   - produce evidence, produce changes, produce benefits
   - likely to produce, able to produce, designed to produce
   
   **Root Analysis**: pro- (forward, forth) + duce (from ducere = to lead) = to lead forth, bring forward
