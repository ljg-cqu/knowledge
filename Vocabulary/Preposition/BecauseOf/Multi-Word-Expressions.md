   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce the cause of something; indicates that something happened because of a particular reason or situation
   - *Fixedness*: strong (highly fixed partnership)
   
   **Synonyms**: because of, due to, owing to, on account of, as a consequence of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal and semi-formal contexts to express causation. Common in reports, academic writing, and professional communication. More formal than "because of" but less formal than "owing to."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be wordy—consider "because of" or "due to" for conciseness. Avoid in casual conversation where simpler alternatives are more natural.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as a direct result of
   - as a consequence of
   - as an outcome of
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Result" naturally pairs with "of" to indicate source/cause, and "as" + "a" creates a prepositional phrase structure. This combination creates a formal causal connector widely accepted in professional discourse.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the capacity of) + a + result (from Latin resultare = to spring back) + of (preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - solely on account of
   - largely on account of
   - on account of the fact that (wordy—avoid)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Account" (reckoning, consideration) + "of" creates a phrase meaning "by reason of." Historical usage in bookkeeping and formal reasoning established this as a causal expression.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + account (from Latin computare = to reckon) + of = by reckoning/reason of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The flight was delayed on account of bad weather.

   - partly owing to
   - owing to the fact that (wordy—avoid)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Owing" (present participle of "owe") + "to" creates a phrase literally meaning "owed to" or "attributable to." Evolved from financial/debt contexts to express causal attribution.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owe (from Old English āgan = to possess, owe) + -ing + to = being owed/attributed to
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - by reason whereof (archaic)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "By" (means) + "reason" (cause) + "of" creates a formal causal expression. Historical use in legal and philosophical discourse established this as a very formal alternative to "because of."
   
   **Root Analysis**: by + reason (from Latin ratio = reckoning, cause) + of = by means of the reason of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Rarely used; too formal)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The defendant was acquitted by reason of insufficient evidence.

   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Consequence" naturally takes "of" to indicate source. "As a" creates a prepositional phrase. Together they form a formal causal expression emphasizing logical relationship between cause and effect.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as + a + consequence (from Latin consequi = to follow) + of = as a following of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - thanks in part to
   - thanks largely to
   - all thanks to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Originally literal gratitude expression, evolved to indicate causal attribution. "Thanks" (plural of gratitude) + "to" (direction) metaphorically credits a cause with producing an effect.
   
   **Root Analysis**: thanks (plural noun from Old English þanc = thought, gratitude) + to (directional preposition)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Thanks to your help, I finished on time.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - in the light of (British)
   - in light of recent events
   - in light of new evidence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Metaphorical use of "light" meaning "illumination/understanding." "In light of X" = "illuminated by/considering X." Established through legal and formal usage.

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - given the fact that (wordy—avoid)
   - given the circumstances
   - given the situation
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Given" (past participle of "give" = accepted as fact) + "that" (introducing clause) = accepting as fact that. Creates a concise way to introduce accepted premises or conditions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: given (past participle of give = accepted, established) + that (subordinating conjunction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Given that it's raining, we should stay inside.
   - Given that you're tired, why don't you rest?

   - for the sake of argument

   - for old times' sake
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Sake" (Old English sacu = dispute, cause, purpose) + "of" creates expression of purpose or benefit. Historical usage established this as expressing motivation or rationale.
   
   **Root Analysis**: for + the + sake (from Old English sacu = cause, purpose) + of = for the purpose/benefit of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm staying quiet for the sake of keeping the peace.
   - Let's just agree for the sake of argument.
