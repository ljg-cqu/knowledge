1. **Adjective**: causal
   **Meaning**: 
   - (attributive/predicative, non-gradable) Relating to or acting as a cause; involving or expressing causation
   
   **Synonyms**: causative, causing, productive, responsible
   
   **Antonyms**: resultant, consequent, effectual
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal, academic, or technical contexts when describing relationships, factors, or mechanisms that involve causation. Common in scientific writing, research papers, and analytical discussions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for everyday conversation—use "causing" or simpler alternatives. Avoid in contexts where more specific terms (direct, indirect, primary, secondary) would be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - causal relationship, causal link, causal factor
   - causal chain, causal mechanism, causal inference
   - establish causal connection, causal analysis
   
   **Root Analysis**: cause + -al (suffix forming adjectives) = relating to cause
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "causa" (cause) + "-al" (adjectival suffix) → English (16th century). Formed to describe relationships involving causation in philosophical and scientific contexts.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They're trying to find the causal connection between stress and illness.
   - Is there a causal link between those two things?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The study examined causal relationships between socioeconomic variables and health outcomes.

   **Synonyms**: resulting, ensuing, subsequent, following, attendant
   
   **Antonyms**: causal, preceding, antecedent, prior
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing when describing effects, results, or outcomes that follow from causes. Common in academic, legal, and technical contexts. More formal than "resulting."
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Rare in casual conversation—use "resulting" instead. Don't confuse with "consistent" or "consequential."
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - consequent changes, consequent effects, consequent results
   - consequent upon [something], consequent to [something]
   - consequent damage, consequent benefits
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (with, together) + sequent (from sequi = to follow) = following together
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "consequens" (following, resulting) from "consequi" (to follow) → Old French → English (15th century). Always retained the meaning of "following as a result."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The storm and the consequent flooding caused huge problems.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - resulting damage, resulting changes, resulting problems
   - resulting from [something], resulting in [something]
   - resulting benefits, resulting consequences
   
   **Root Analysis**: result + -ing (present participle suffix forming adjective) = arising as a result
   
   **Etymology**: From verb "result" (Latin "resultare" = to spring back) + "-ing" → English (17th century). Adjectival form emphasizing the outcome nature.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - attributable to factors, attributable to causes, attributable to circumstances
   - largely attributable, directly attributable, primarily attributable
   - deaths attributable to, success attributable to, changes attributable to

   - contributory role, contributory element
   - prove contributory, identify contributory factors
   
   **Root Analysis**: contribute + -ory (relating to, characterized by) = characterized by contributing
