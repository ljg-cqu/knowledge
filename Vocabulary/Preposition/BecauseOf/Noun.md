1. **Noun**: cause (C/U)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (C) A person, thing, or event that makes something happen; the reason why something happens
   - (U) The principle of causation; the relationship between cause and effect
   
   **Synonyms**: reason, source, origin, root, basis
   
   **Antonyms**: effect, result, consequence, outcome, product
   
   **When to Use**: Use in both casual and formal contexts when discussing reasons or origins of events. Common in academic writing, scientific discourse, legal contexts, and everyday explanations. Essential for causal analysis and reasoning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid confusion with "because"—they serve different grammatical functions. Don't overuse in causal chains where more specific terms (factor, trigger, catalyst) might be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - root cause, underlying cause, direct cause
   - cause and effect, cause of concern, lost cause
   - the cause of [something], find the cause, determine the cause
   
   **Root Analysis**: cause (from Latin causa = reason, purpose, lawsuit)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "causa" (reason, purpose, case) → Old French "cause" → Middle English "cause" (13th century). Originally meant "reason" or "motive," later extended to legal contexts and scientific causation.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Antonyms**: result, effect, consequence, outcome
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explaining motivations, justifications, or causes in any register. More common in everyday speech than "cause" and emphasizes the logical or explanatory aspect. Appropriate for both objective causes and subjective motivations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In very technical or scientific contexts where "cause" or "factor" might be more precise. Avoid when discussing non-rational or unconscious influences.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - for this reason, for some reason, the reason why
   - good reason, valid reason, no reason
   - reason for [something], give a reason, explain the reason

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - contributing factor, key factor, determining factor
   - risk factor, success factor, critical factor
   - factor in [something], take into account factors, consider various factors
   
   **Root Analysis**: factor (from Latin facere = to do, make)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "factor" (doer, maker) from "facere" (to do, make) → English (15th century). Originally meant "agent" or "doer," later adopted in mathematics (16th century) and generalized to mean "contributing element" (17th century).

   - as a consequence of, in consequence, face the consequences
   - dire consequences, unintended consequences, unforeseen consequences
   - consequence of [something], suffer consequences, accept consequences

   **Etymology**: Latin "consequentia" (a following, result) from "consequi" (to follow after) → Old French "consequence" → Middle English (14th century). Always retained the sense of "result" or "logical conclusion."
