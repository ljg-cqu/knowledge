1. **Functional Expression**: "I understand that [statement]" (function: acknowledging/showing comprehension)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: direct
   
   **Synonyms**: I gather that, I believe that, It's my understanding that, I'm aware that, I see that
   
   **Antonyms**: I don't understand, I'm confused about, I'm unclear on
   
   **When to Use**: Use when acknowledging information received, showing comprehension of a situation, or indicating belief based on information (particularly in professional contexts)
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use when you're actually uncertain or guessing (misleads the listener). Not appropriate when disagreement would be more honest (understanding ≠ agreeing)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I understand that you're concerned about...
   - If I understand correctly...
   - As I understand it...
   - My understanding is that...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression serves multiple functions: (1) acknowledging receipt of information, (2) checking comprehension, (3) softening potential disagreement. In "I understand that... but..." it signals upcoming disagreement politely
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "Yes, that's correct" / "Exactly"
   - Correcting: "Not quite—let me clarify" / "Actually..."
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use when giving safety warnings, legal prohibitions, absolute rules, or emphatic restrictions where no exceptions exist
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for preferences or negotiable situations (too strong). Inappropriate for casual advice or suggestions. Can sound authoritarian in routine contexts
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Under no circumstances must you...
   - Under no circumstances are you to...
   - You should not, under any circumstances...
   - Never, under any circumstances, should you...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This is a high-impact, emphatic construction using negative politeness (strong warning). Creates face-threatening act, so reserve for serious situations. The formality and emphasis signal non-negotiability
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Accepting: "I understand completely" / "Understood"
   - Seeking clarification: "Not even if [exception]?" / "What if [scenario]?"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When to Use**: Use when checking understanding, expressing beliefs that may need confirmation, or politely introducing potentially incorrect information
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for facts you're certain about (sounds uncertain unnecessarily). Not for situations requiring confident assertion
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - I was under the impression that...
   - Am I correct in being under the impression that...?
   - Unless I'm under the wrong impression...
   - I was under the mistaken impression that...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: This expression uses negative politeness (hedging) to soften assertions and allow for correction without loss of face. "Under the impression" implies your belief may be wrong, inviting correction
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Confirming: "That's correct" / "Yes, exactly"
   - Correcting: "Actually, ..." / "Not quite—actually..."

   **Common Variations**: 
   - I work under [name]
   - She works directly under the CEO
   - Everyone working under that manager
   - Teams working under his leadership
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: "Under" emphasizes hierarchy and authority. Some modern organizations prefer "reporting to" or "working with" to emphasize collaboration over hierarchy. Cultural variations exist in comfort with explicit hierarchy
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Acknowledging: "I see" / "Got it"
   - Inquiring: "How long have you been in that role?" / "How is that going?"

   - Just to check my understanding...
   - Can I check my understanding of what you said?

   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Inviting paraphrase: "Please do" / "Go ahead"
   - After paraphrase—confirming: "Yes, exactly" / "That's right"

   **Common Variations**: 
   - Under these circumstances...
   - Given the circumstances...
   - Under such circumstances...
   - Considering the circumstances...
