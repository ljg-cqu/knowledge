# Extract Functional Language for Vocabulary Learning: Under

**Task**: Extract functional language expressions and speech acts involving "under" that are essential for pragmatic communication and social interaction from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one functional expression or speech act pattern with "under" with comprehensive learning information including pragmatic function, usage context, formality level, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all functional expressions with "under" that perform specific communicative actions
- Prioritize: expressions describing conditions, authority, pressure, circumstances, and understanding
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-frequency social interactions)
- Do not skip sections; cover both direct and indirect speech acts

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in functional expressions actually present in source
- Never invent expressions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard pragmatic descriptions

**Focus:**
- Expressing conditions or circumstances (under the circumstances, under these conditions, given that)
- Expressing authority or control (under someone's supervision, reporting to, answerable to)
- Expressing pressure or stress (under pressure, feeling overwhelmed, struggling with)
- Expressing understanding or agreement (I understand, I see what you mean, got it)
- Expressing limitations or constraints (under certain limitations, subject to restrictions)
- Making commitments or undertaking actions (I'll take care of it, I'll handle this)
- Expressing insufficiency (underperforming, falling short, not meeting expectations)
- Hedging with "under" expressions (under the impression that, under the assumption that)
