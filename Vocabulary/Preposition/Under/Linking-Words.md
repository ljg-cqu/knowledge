1. **Linking Word**: under these conditions (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a consequence or action that applies when specific conditions exist; indicates conditional relationship between circumstances and outcomes
   - *Function*: Conditional/circumstantial connector establishing logical relationship
   
   **Synonyms**: given these conditions, with these conditions, in these circumstances, when this is the case, with these parameters
   
   **Antonyms**: without these conditions, regardless of conditions, under different conditions
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or technical writing/speech when establishing conditional relationships, particularly when describing system behavior, policies, or outcomes dependent on specific circumstances
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation. Don't use when simple "if" or "when" would be clearer. Avoid overuse which creates stilted prose
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [conditions statement]. Under these conditions, [consequence/action]
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial after stating conditions, followed by comma
   - [Punctuation]: Preceded by period/semicolon; followed by comma
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without first establishing what "these conditions" are; using mid-sentence without proper punctuation
   
   **Root Analysis**: under (subject to) + these (demonstrative) + conditions (circumstances)
   
   **Etymology**: Modern discourse marker from prepositional phrase. "Under" meaning "subject to" + "conditions" (circumstances). Used in formal/technical registers
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - When it's this cold, you need to dress warmly. Under these conditions, frostbite can happen fast.
   - The soil is really dry. Under these conditions, nothing's going to grow well.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The temperature has fallen below freezing while humidity remains high. Under these conditions, ice formation on aircraft surfaces becomes a significant safety concern.
   - Market volatility has increased substantially while liquidity has decreased. Under these conditions, risk exposure must be carefully monitored.

1. **Linking Word**: under normal circumstances (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce what would typically happen or be expected if conditions were ordinary; contrasts normal expectations with actual unusual situation
   - *Function*: Contrastive connector signaling deviation from normalcy
   
   **Synonyms**: normally, ordinarily, typically, usually, in normal situations, generally
   
   **Antonyms**: in these unusual circumstances, exceptionally, under these conditions, in this case
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explaining why something normal isn't happening, or when establishing baseline expectations before describing exceptions or unusual situations
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use if circumstances actually are normal (redundant). Avoid in contexts where no contrast with abnormal circumstances is needed
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Under normal circumstances, [expected action]. However, [actual situation/action]
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial, followed by comma, often with contrastive connector in next clause
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by comma; often precedes "but," "however," "yet" in subsequent clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without subsequent contrast; failing to specify what makes circumstances abnormal
   
   **Root Analysis**: under (within) + normal (ordinary) + circumstances (conditions)
   
   **Etymology**: Modern discourse marker. Extended from literal "under circumstances" to formulaic expression contrasting normal with exceptional cases
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Under normal circumstances, I'd totally go to the party, but I'm just too tired tonight.
   - Under normal circumstances, this would take like ten minutes, but the system's down.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Under normal circumstances, approval would be granted within five business days. However, the current backlog necessitates extended processing times.
   - Under normal circumstances, the committee would convene quarterly. Given the urgency of recent developments, extraordinary sessions have been scheduled.

1. **Linking Word**: thereunder (type: formal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Under or in accordance with that (document, law, agreement, or statement); used in legal/formal contexts to refer to provisions or authority previously mentioned
   - *Function*: Reference connector in legal and formal documents
   
   **Synonyms**: under it, under that, in accordance with that, pursuant to that, under those provisions
   
   **Antonyms**: separate from that, independent of that, notwithstanding that
   
   **When to Use**: Use in legal documents, contracts, formal regulations, or academic writing when referring back to previously mentioned rules, provisions, or authorities
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Far too formal for ordinary writing or speech. Don't use in general business communications (use "under that" or "under those provisions"). Not in casual contexts
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Reference to law/document/provision] and [rights/obligations] thereunder
   - [Position]: Typically clause-final or mid-sentence following the noun it modifies
   - [Punctuation]: No special punctuation required; integrated into sentence structure
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using in non-legal writing where simpler alternatives exist; using without clear antecedent
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (demonstrative adverb) + under (beneath, subject to)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English compound of *there* + *under*. Archaic in general use but preserved in legal register. Part of formal legal English like "thereof," "therein," "thereby"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   *Not used in casual speech—far too formal*
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The Agreement and all rights and obligations thereunder shall be governed by New York law.
   - Article 15 of the Treaty establishes certain protections, and any violation thereunder shall constitute grounds for arbitration.

1. **Linking Word**: under which (type: relative connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a relative clause describing conditions, circumstances, or systems; connects subordinate clause explaining circumstances or rules
   - *Function*: Relative connector establishing conditional or circumstantial relationship
   
   **Synonyms**: in which, where, whereby, through which (depending on context)
   
   **Antonyms**: outside of which, except for which, without which
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or academic writing when describing circumstances, systems, agreements, or frameworks; introduces explanatory relative clauses
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can sound overly formal in casual contexts (use "where" instead). Avoid when simpler constructions ("when" or "if") work better
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [noun phrase describing system/condition] under which [relative clause]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence following noun phrase; introduces relative clause
   - [Punctuation]: May use comma if relative clause is non-restrictive; no comma if restrictive
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing with "in which"; using without clear antecedent; overusing in formal writing
   
   **Root Analysis**: under (subject to) + which (relative pronoun)
   
   **Etymology**: Prepositional phrase with relative pronoun. "Under" (subject to/within) combined with relative "which" to form connector
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need to figure out the rules under which we're operating here.
   - What are the conditions under which you'd actually consider moving?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The framework under which these regulations operate requires comprehensive environmental assessment.
   - The study examined the conditions under which organizational change initiatives succeed or fail.

1. **Linking Word**: as understood (type: discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate how something is interpreted or comprehended; signals that what follows reflects a particular interpretation or understanding
   - *Function*: Interpretive connector signaling how information is construed
   
   **Synonyms**: as interpreted, as comprehended, as construed, based on the understanding that, as perceived
   
   **Antonyms**: as stated explicitly, literally, as written, without interpretation
   
   **When to Use**: Use when clarifying interpretation, particularly when acknowledging that understanding may differ from literal statement or when multiple interpretations exist
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't use for unambiguous statements. Not appropriate when certainty is required rather than interpretation
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement], as understood [by whom/how], [elaboration/consequence]
   - [Position]: Mid-sentence or sentence-final, often with comma
   - [Punctuation]: Usually preceded and/or followed by commas when used parenthetically
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without specifying who understands or how; using when direct statement is more appropriate
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the manner of) + understood (past participle of "understand")
   
   **Etymology**: Modern formation combining comparative "as" with passive "understood". Common in academic and professional contexts where interpretation matters
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The rules, as understood by most people, don't really apply in this situation.
   - Your message, as I understood it, was that we should wait.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The legislation, as understood by legal scholars, extends protection to previously uncovered categories.
   - The data, as understood within the theoretical framework employed, support the hypothesis.

1. **Linking Word**: on the understanding that (type: conditional connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to introduce a condition or assumption upon which an agreement, action, or statement depends; establishes conditional basis for what precedes
   - *Function*: Conditional connector establishing basis for agreement or action
   
   **Synonyms**: with the understanding that, on condition that, provided that, with the provision that, assuming that
   
   **Antonyms**: regardless of, without condition, unconditionally
   
   **When to Use**: Use in agreements, negotiations, or conditional statements where action depends on mutual understanding or specific conditions being met
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for casual conversation. Don't use when unconditional action is intended. Not appropriate when legal enforceability requires "provided that" or "on condition that"
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Action/agreement] on the understanding that [condition/assumption]
   - [Position]: Typically clause-final, but can be sentence-initial in formal writing
   - [Punctuation]: Preceded by comma when clause-final; followed by comma when sentence-initial
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using without clear conditional relationship; confusing with "with the understanding that" (slightly different emphasis)
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (dependent upon) + the understanding (agreement, comprehension) + that (connector)
   
   **Etymology**: Modern formal phrase. "On" indicating dependency + "understanding" (agreement/comprehension) + "that" (subordinating conjunction)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'll help you move, but on the understanding that you'll help me next month when I move.
   - You can borrow my car, on the understanding that you fill up the tank.
