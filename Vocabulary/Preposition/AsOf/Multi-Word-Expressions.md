1. **Expression**: as of [date] (type: compound preposition phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A compound prepositional phrase indicating the specific point in time at which information is valid, accurate, or applicable
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the words "as" and "of" must appear together in this order with a time expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: effective [date], at [date], on [date], by [date] (contextual)
   
   **Antonyms**: prior to [date], before [date], until [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Business writing, financial statements, legal documents, reports, official communications; any context requiring precise temporal reference; formal and semi-formal registers; essential for date-specific disclaimers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual conversation where approximate timing suffices; creative writing unless mimicking business style; when repeated use makes writing feel stilted
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as of right now (immediate present)
   - as of today/this date (current day reference)
   - as of the date hereof (legal/formal writing)
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For compound preposition*: "As" (in the capacity/manner of) + "of" (concerning/from) creates a specialized temporal meaning not available from either word alone. The phrase evolved in business and legal English to provide precise temporal boundaries for statements, serving as a liability-limiting device. The combination fills a lexical gap for expressing "valid at this specific point in time."
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (Old English "also" - in the way of) + of (Old English "of" - from, concerning)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My balance as of yesterday was like $200.
   - As of now, I'm still going to the party.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, are presented in Appendix A.
   - As of the effective date specified herein, all prior agreements are null and void.

1. **Expression**: effective as of [date] (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Indicates when a change, policy, rule, or agreement begins to be in force or operative
   - Combined meaning: the beginning point of validity or enforcement
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very fixed in legal and business contexts)
   
   **Synonyms**: taking effect on [date], operative from [date], valid from [date], in force as of [date]
   
   **Antonyms**: terminating as of [date], expiring on [date], ceasing as of [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Legal documents, contracts, policy announcements, official notices, business communications about changes; when announcing when something starts to apply; formal register
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For ongoing information that isn't about a change taking effect; casual contexts; when simpler language ("starting [date]") would suffice
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - effective immediately as of [date]
   - shall be effective as of [date] (legal/mandatory)
   - becomes effective as of [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: "Effective" carries the meaning of "in operation" and "as of" provides precise temporal specification. Together they create a standard legal/business formula for announcing when changes take effect. The phrase has high fixedness because it serves a specific contractual and regulatory function, and alternatives lack the same legal weight and precision.
   
   **Root Analysis**: effective (from Latin "effectivus" - producing an effect) + as of (temporal marker)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new schedule is effective as of Monday.
   - Your membership is effective as of today.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - This amendment shall be effective as of January 1, 2024.
   - The revised compensation structure is effective as of the commencement of the next fiscal year.

1. **Expression**: as of the date hereof/thereof (type: legal fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Legal phrase meaning "as of the date of this document" or "as of the date of that document"
   - Provides temporal reference without repeating the actual date
   - *Fixedness*: very strong (formulaic legal language)
   
   **Synonyms**: as of this date, as of that date, on the date of this document
   
   **Antonyms**: prior to the date hereof, before this date
   
   **When to Use**: Legal contracts, formal agreements, official documents where legal precision is required; particularly when the document's date serves as the reference point; very formal register only
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Outside legal/formal contexts; casual or semi-formal writing; when specific dates should be stated explicitly for clarity
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as of the date of this agreement
   - as of the date first written above
   - as of the execution date
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For legal phrase*: This is a legal formula using archaic deictic terms ("hereof" = of this). The phrase emerged in legal English as a space-saving and elegant way to reference a document's own date without repetition. "Hereof" and "thereof" are part of legal English's conservative vocabulary, maintaining formulaic expressions that have established legal interpretation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as of + here/there (locative) + of (genitive marker in "hereof/thereof")
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Not used in casual contexts)
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - As of the date hereof, all representations and warranties remain in full force.
   - The parties acknowledge that, as of the date hereof, no default has occurred.

1. **Expression**: as of right now/as of this moment (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Emphasizes the immediate present time while implying possibility of future change
   - Hedging expression that provides current information with caveat
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common collocation but words can vary)
   
   **Synonyms**: right now, at this moment, currently, at present, for now
   
   **Antonyms**: permanently, indefinitely, for the foreseeable future
   
   **When to Use**: Informal to neutral registers; when providing updates in fluid situations; when hedging against future changes; verbal communications and informal updates; particularly in crisis or rapidly changing scenarios
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Formal documentation where vague time references are inappropriate; when conveying permanence; when precise timestamps are needed
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as of now (slightly more formal)
   - as of this very moment (more emphatic)
   - as things stand right now
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Right now" and "this moment" are intensifiers that emphasize immediacy. When combined with "as of," they create a formal-informal hybrid that adds temporal precision to an immediate time reference while maintaining the hedging quality of "as of." The combination is natural because it merges the formality of "as of" with the informality of "right now."
   
   **Root Analysis**: as of + right (directly, immediately) + now (present moment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As of right now, I'm still planning to come.
   - As of this moment, we have 50 confirmed guests.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - As of this writing, negotiations remain ongoing.
   - As of the present moment, all systems are operational.

1. **Expression**: as of [specified date], there are/is [number] (type: reporting formula)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Standard formula for reporting statistics, counts, or status at a specific point in time
   - Provides temporal snapshot of quantitative data
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard reporting structure)
   
   **Synonyms**: at [date], there are/is...; by [date], the count is...; on [date], we have...
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (reporting formula has no direct opposite)
   
   **When to Use**: Business reports, statistical updates, data presentations, dashboards, status reports; any context requiring point-in-time quantitative information; neutral to formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When data changes so rapidly that point-in-time reference is meaningless; when trends over time are more important than snapshots
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - as of [date], the total stands at [number]
   - as of [date], we have [number]
   - as of [date], [number] remain
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For reporting formula*: This is a standard data reporting structure that has become conventionalized in business English. "As of" + date + existential "there is/are" creates a formal but accessible way to present statistics. The structure is fixed because it efficiently combines temporal specification with existential statement, serving the specific rhetorical function of data reporting.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as of + existential there + be verb + quantifier
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As of this morning, there are 47 people signed up.
   - As of yesterday, there were still three spots left.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - As of September 30, 2024, there are 3,247 active members in the organization.

   - Indicates that something (document, agreement, credential) is legitimate and in force at a specific time
   - Combined meaning: maintains legal/official status at the reference date

   **Synonyms**: in effect as of [date], in force as of [date], current as of [date], good as of [date]
   
   **Antonyms**: expired as of [date], invalid as of [date], void as of [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Official documents, certifications, licenses, credentials, agreements; when confirming legal or official status at a specific time; formal and semi-formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Casual contexts; when permanent validity is intended; when "effective" would better emphasize beginning of validity
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - remains valid as of [date]
   - no longer valid as of [date]
   - still valid as of [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Valid" describes legal/official acceptability, and "as of" provides temporal boundary. The combination is natural because validity is often time-bound (expiration dates, renewal periods). The phrase serves administrative and legal functions where temporal validity is crucial.
   
   **Root Analysis**: valid (Latin "validus" - strong, effective) + as of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Is your passport still valid as of next month?
   - My license is valid as of the renewal date.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The certification remains valid as of the date of this verification.
   - All previously issued permits are valid as of July 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

1. **Expression**: accurate as of [date] (type: collocation)

   **Synonyms**: correct as of [date], current as of [date], up-to-date as of [date], precise as of [date]
   
   **Antonyms**: outdated as of [date], incorrect as of [date], inaccurate as of [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Reports, publications, websites, data presentations, any material requiring currency disclaimer; protects against liability for subsequent changes; formal and semi-formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When information is guaranteed to remain accurate; casual contexts; when emphasizing that information may be wrong (not just outdated)
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - accurate as of the date of publication
   - believed to be accurate as of [date]
   - accurate to the best of our knowledge as of [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Accurate" describes correctness, and "as of" limits the temporal scope of that accuracy. The combination functions as a legal hedge, protecting information providers from liability when things change. This is a high-frequency business collocation because it serves a critical risk-management function.
   
   **Root Analysis**: accurate (Latin "accuratus" - done with care) + as of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This info is accurate as of yesterday.
   - The numbers are accurate as of last Friday.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The data presented in this report is accurate as of December 31, 2023, and is subject to change.

   **Antonyms**: outdated as of [date], obsolete as of [date], superseded as of [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Business communications, data reports, status updates, documentation; when emphasizing information is current; professional and formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When information is historical or intentionally not current; casual contexts; when "current" might be redundant with present tense
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - most current as of [date]
   - currently valid as of [date]
   - current and accurate as of [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Current" describes present or recent status, and "as of" specifies when that currency applies. The pairing is natural because currency is inherently time-dependent. The phrase is common in business because it combines assurance (current) with precision (as of date).
   
   **Root Analysis**: current (Latin "currere" - to run, flow) + as of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This list is current as of this morning.
   - Your info is current as of today.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The pricing information is current as of the effective date shown above.
   - All data is current as of the close of the reporting period.

1. **Expression**: as of [date], subject to change (type: fixed phrase/disclaimer)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Standard disclaimer indicating information is accurate at specified date but may be modified later

   **Antonyms**: permanent as of [date], unchanging as of [date], guaranteed through [date]
   
   **When to Use**: Published materials, websites, reports, any documentation where information might change; protects against liability; formal register; particularly important in volatile contexts (pricing, regulations, policies)
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When information is stable and unlikely to change; when the disclaimer might unnecessarily undermine confidence; internal documents where hedging isn't needed
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - subject to change without notice as of [date]
   - accurate as of [date] and subject to revision
   - current as of [date]; terms subject to change
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrase*: This is a standard legal/business formula combining temporal specificity ("as of [date]") with a liability hedge ("subject to change"). The phrase has become formulaic because it efficiently serves both informational and legal functions. It's a face-saving device that manages expectations while protecting the information provider.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as of + subject (placed under) + to + change
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - These prices are good as of today but subject to change.
   - The schedule is current as of now, subject to change.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **When to Use**: Financial statements, invoices, accounts receivable/payable reports, status reports; business and accounting contexts; formal and semi-formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When referring to "outstanding" in the sense of "excellent"; casual contexts; when precision about what remains outstanding isn't clear
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - outstanding balance as of [date]
   - outstanding obligations as of [date]
   - remain outstanding as of [date]
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocation*: "Outstanding" in financial contexts means "unpaid/unsettled," and "as of" specifies the reference date for that status. The combination is essential in accounting and finance because financial positions are always assessed at specific points in time. This is a technical collocation with high fixedness in its domain.
   
   **Root Analysis**: outstanding (out + standing - remaining unpaid) + as of
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You have $50 outstanding as of today.
   - What's outstanding as of the end of last month?
