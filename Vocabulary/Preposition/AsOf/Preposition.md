1. **Preposition**: as of (type: compound preposition)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* On, at, or from a specified date or time; indicating the point at which information is accurate or a condition applies
   - Used to establish temporal validity or reference point for statements, data, or conditions
   - Emphasizes the specific moment when something is true or takes effect
   
   **Synonyms**: effective (emphasizing activation), at (more general), on (for dates), from (emphasizing starting point), by (for deadlines)
   
   **Antonyms**: until (endpoint), before (prior time), prior to (formal, before)
   
   **When to Use**: In business writing, financial statements, legal documents, reports, data presentations, and official communications; when precise temporal reference is critical; particularly common in contexts requiring disclaimers about information currency; formal and semi-formal registers
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In casual conversation where approximate timing suffices; creative or narrative writing unless mimicking business style; when repeated use makes writing feel overly formal or stilted; avoid with vague time references
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: as of [specific date], as of today, as of now, as of right now, as of this writing, as of the date hereof
   - **Verb + prep**: N/A (as of functions as prepositional phrase introducer, not in phrasal verbs)
   - **Adjective + prep**: accurate as of, valid as of, effective as of, current as of, outstanding as of
   - **Noun + prep**: balance as of, status as of, total as of, figures as of, membership as of
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the manner/capacity of) + of (from, concerning) = compound meaning "at the point in time of"
   
   **Etymology**: Compound preposition developed in English business and legal writing; "as" (Old English "also") + "of" (Old English "of") → combined to create precise temporal reference (19th-20th century usage in business English)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My account had $500 as of yesterday.
   - As of now, I'm still planning to go.

   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Temporal)* In operation or in force from a specified date
   - Indicating when something begins to be valid, applicable, or operative

   **Synonyms**: as of (temporal validity), from (starting point), commencing (formal), beginning, starting
   
   **Antonyms**: terminating, ending, expiring, ceasing
   
   **When to Use**: In legal documents, contracts, policy announcements, price changes, regulatory notices; when emphasizing that something takes effect or becomes operative; particularly strong in contexts involving changes, rules, rates, or policies
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When describing static information rather than changes; in very casual contexts; when "as of" would better indicate information validity without implying activation
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: effective [date], effective as of [date], effective immediately as of [date]
   - **Verb + prep**: become effective, made effective, declared effective
   - **Adjective + prep**: N/A (effective itself is typically the modifier)
   - **Noun + prep**: (noun) effective [date] (e.g., "the policy effective January 1")
   
   **Root Analysis**: ef- (ex-, out) + fect (make, do) + -ive (adjective, here functioning as preposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "effectivus" (productive, effective) → developed prepositional use in legal English meaning "in effect from [date]" (19th century)

   **Antonyms**: N/A (time-specific prepositions don't have direct opposites)
   
   **When to Use**: For specific clock times, precise moments, or time expressions; across all registers; more common than "as of" in general speech; British English uses "at" more broadly for times
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When "as of" would better convey formal temporal validity; with date expressions in American English (prefer "on"); for periods rather than points (use "during")
   
   **Common Patterns**:

   **When to Use**: With dates, days of the week, specific named days; standard across all registers; American English preference for dates; when general temporal location is sufficient
