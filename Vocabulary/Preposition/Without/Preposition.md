1. **Preposition**: without (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial/Abstract)* Used to indicate the absence of something or someone; not having, possessing, or including something
   - *(Abstract)* Used to indicate that something does not happen or someone does not do something; in the absence of an action or condition
   
   **Synonyms**: lacking (in formal contexts), minus (in informal/mathematical contexts), in the absence of (formal), devoid of (very formal)
   
   **Antonyms**: with, including, having, possessing
   
   **When to Use**: Use "without" to express absence, lack, or negation; to indicate that something is missing or that an action doesn't occur; common in all registers from casual to formal; essential for expressing conditions, states of being, and hypotheticals
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse with "outside" (spatial location); avoid double negatives (e.g., "without nothing" - use "without anything"); don't use when "with no" is more natural in some idiomatic expressions
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: without doubt, without question, without fail, without exception, without warning, without delay
   - **Verb + without**: go without, do without, manage without, live without, proceed without
   - **Adjective + without**: (not typically used with adjectives)
   - **Noun + without**: life without, world without, day without, success without
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (Old English "with" = against/toward) + out (= outside/beyond) → originally meant "on the outside" or "externally"
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "wiþūtan" (with + utan = on the outside) → Middle English "withoute" → Modern English "without". Originally meant "outside" or "externally," evolved to mean "lacking" or "in the absence of"
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I can't imagine my life without coffee in the morning.
   - She left without saying goodbye, which was weird.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The research cannot proceed without proper funding and institutional approval.
   - Without adequate infrastructure, economic development remains severely constrained.

2. **Preposition**: without (in conditional/result constructions) (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Used to introduce a condition expressing what would not happen if something else did not happen; equivalent to "if...not" or "unless"
   
   **Synonyms**: but for (formal), were it not for (very formal), if not for (neutral), lacking (formal)
   
   **Antonyms**: with, given, having
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal writing and speech to express hypothetical conditions or results; to indicate that one thing depends on another; common in academic, legal, and professional contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: May sound overly formal in very casual conversation; avoid when simpler constructions like "if not" would be clearer to listeners
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: without which (formal relative clause), without whom (formal), without this/that
   - **Verb + without**: cannot exist without, would fail without, would be impossible without
   - **Adjective + without**: impossible without, inconceivable without, unthinkable without
   - **Noun + without**: consequence without, result without, outcome without
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as above - with + out
   
   **Etymology**: Same as above; the conditional meaning evolved from the core sense of absence
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Without you, I would've totally failed that exam.
   - We can't finish this project without more help.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Without the generous support of our donors, this initiative would not have been possible.
   - The data, without which the analysis would be incomplete, was provided by the research institution.

3. **Preposition**: without (in gerund constructions) (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Used before a gerund (-ing form) to indicate that an action does not occur or is avoided; expressing the absence of an action
   
   **Synonyms**: not + gerund (informal rephrasing), while not + gerund (more explicit)
   
   **Antonyms**: while + gerund, by + gerund, through + gerund
   
   **When to Use**: Common in all registers; particularly useful for expressing manner, means, or circumstances of an action; creates concise, elegant constructions in formal writing
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Ensure the gerund form is correct (e.g., "without asking," not "without to ask"); don't confuse with infinitive constructions
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: without saying, without thinking, without asking, without knowing, without realizing, without hesitation
   - **Verb + without + gerund**: left without saying, did without asking, proceeded without consulting
   - **Adjective + without + gerund**: impossible without trying, difficult without understanding
   - **Common expressions**: without further ado, go without saying, without batting an eye
   
   **Root Analysis**: Same as above
   
   **Etymology**: Same as above; this pattern reflects the standard use of prepositions before gerunds in English
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He just took my laptop without asking, can you believe it?
   - I got through the whole day without checking my phone once.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The committee approved the proposal without conducting a thorough review of the implications.
   - One cannot achieve mastery without dedicating considerable time and effort to practice.
