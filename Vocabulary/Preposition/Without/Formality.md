   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher status or formal evaluation contexts require "autonomously" or "independently"; peers allow "on my own"
   - *Social Distance*: Strangers and professional contexts need "independently"; close relationships allow "on my own"
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Serious contexts (medical, legal, safety) require formal register
   - *Cultural Context*: Anglo cultures often value independence positively; adjust tone for collectivist cultures
   - *Medium*: Written formal documents require elevated vocabulary; spoken casual allows simpler forms
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "on my own" in formal academic writing (too casual - use "independently" or "without assistance")
