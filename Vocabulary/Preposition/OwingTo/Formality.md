   *Avoid when*: Communicating with affected customers, dealing with serious safety issues, legal or compliance contexts

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use the formal version for customers, executives, or external partners; semi‑formal for peers; casual only inside close teams.
   - *Social Distance*: Greater distance (unknown audience, large mailing lists) → more formal. Known teams and colleagues → semi‑formal or lively.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If safety or cost is involved, prefer formal or empathetic tone.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect explicit apology and formality in cancellations; others value concise, factual style.
   - *Medium*: Formal for letters and official notices; semi‑formal for email; casual/humorous only for internal, low‑stakes channels.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using jokes when people have lost money or travelled far—minimizes their frustration.
   - Overusing "owing to" in very informal channels—sounds stiff and distant.
   - Giving only "bad weather" without clarity about next steps—leaves readers uncertain.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some business cultures, explicitly naming the cause ("owing to adverse weather conditions") and apologizing is expected. In others, brevity is preferred, but empathy is still important.

   - Switching between "because of" and "owing to" randomly—pick the register that fits the audience.

   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Email to enterprise customers → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("The release was delayed owing to critical technical issues identified during final testing.")
