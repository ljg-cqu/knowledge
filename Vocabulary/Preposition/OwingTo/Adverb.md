1. **Adverb**: consequently (type: sentence/linking)
   **Meaning**: 
   - As a result; for that reason. Used to introduce an outcome that follows logically from a previous cause or situation.
   - *Position*: Typically sentence-initial with a comma ("..., ...; consequently, ...") or mid-position between commas.
   
   **Synonyms**: therefore, thus, as a result, accordingly, hence
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, nonetheless, still
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to highlight the result that follows from a clearly stated cause, especially in formal writing. Very natural after a clause beginning with `owing to`: *"Owing to X, Y was impossible; consequently, Z happened."*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for very casual conversation—use "so" instead. Avoid when the relationship is contrastive (use "however") or when the cause is vague.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - consequently leading to
   - and consequently
   - consequently, we/they
   - consequently resulted in
   
   **Root Analysis**: consequent (following as a result) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *consequens* (following) via Old French; the adverb "consequently" has been used since the 15th century to signal logical result.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to the heavy snow, all the roads were blocked; consequently, we stayed at home.
   - Owing to a last‑minute change, the tickets sold out; consequently, we couldn’t get in.

1. **Adverb**: therefore (type: sentence/linking)
   **Meaning**: 
   - For that reason; as a logical conclusion from what has just been stated.
   - *Position*: Commonly sentence-initial with a comma or between clauses after a semicolon.
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, thus, hence, as a result
   
   **Antonyms**: however, yet, nevertheless, on the other hand
   
   **When to Use**: Use to draw a clear logical line from a cause to its consequence. Works especially well in formal reasoning: *"Owing to X, Y occurred; therefore, Z is required."*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Sounds too formal in chatty conversation—"so" is usually better there. Avoid when you are contrasting, not concluding.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - we therefore conclude
   - it is therefore necessary
   - therefore, we recommend
   - and therefore
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (that) + fore (for, because of) → "for that (reason)"
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English *þær for* (for that), used since Middle English to express explicit logical consequence.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to the strike, trains were cancelled; therefore, we had to drive.

   - In this way; as a result of this. Often used to compress a cause-and-effect link into a single, compact connector.
   - *Position*: Typically sentence-initial with a comma, or mid‑clause after the subject.
   
   **Synonyms**: therefore, consequently, hence, as a result
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, instead, otherwise
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or academic writing when you want a concise, slightly literary way to show consequence: *"Owing to X, Y; thus, Z."*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Feels stiff or old‑fashioned in casual speech. Avoid stringing many formal linkers together (e.g., "owing to..., thus, therefore...").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - thus creating
   - thus leading to
   - thus making it possible
   - and thus
   
   **Root Analysis**: from Old English *þus* = "in this way, to this extent"
   
   **Etymology**: Recorded since Old English, used both for "in this way" and, by extension, for logical consequence in written English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to a mix‑up with the dates, nobody showed up, thus turning the launch into a non‑event.
   - Owing to the delay, we arrived after dark, thus missing the opening speech.

   **When to Use**: Use in formal prose when you want a compact, slightly old‑fashioned connector for consequence, often after `owing to` explanations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Rare in informal speech; can sound archaic if overused. Avoid when the causal link is weak or speculative.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - hence the need for
   - hence the delay
   - hence our decision
   - and hence
   
   **Root Analysis**: from Old English *heonan* (away, hence) → sense of "from this".
   
   **Etymology**: Used since Middle English to mean "from this time/place" and later extended to logical consequence ("for this reason").
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to the late start, we’re behind schedule—hence the rush.
   - Owing to the outage, the files weren’t saved, hence the missing report.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - plan accordingly
   - act accordingly
   - adjust accordingly
   - budget accordingly
   
   **Root Analysis**: according (matching, in agreement) + -ly (adverb)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *acorder* (to agree); "accordingly" has long meant "in a way that matches" and then "as a fitting result".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to the train strike, we left much earlier and planned accordingly.
   - Owing to her injury, the coach changed the lineup accordingly.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - thereby reducing
   - thereby increasing
   - thereby creating
   - thereby ensuring
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (that) + by (by means of)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English elements; in legal and formal prose it has long marked tightly linked cause‑effect.
   
   **Examples [Casual】**: 
   - Owing to the noise, we closed the window, thereby making the room much quieter.
   - Owing to a schedule clash, they combined two meetings, thereby saving everyone time.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - ultimately led to
   - ultimately resulted in
   - ultimately meant that
   - ultimately depends on
   
   **Root Analysis**: ultimate (last, final) + -ly (adverb)
   
   **Etymology**: From Late Latin *ultimatus* (last, final); "ultimately" has been used in English since the 17th century to signal final outcomes or deepest reasons.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:
