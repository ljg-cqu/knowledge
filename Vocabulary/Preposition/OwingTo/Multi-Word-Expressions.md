1. **Expression**: owing to unforeseen circumstances (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A highly conventional expression used to explain that an unexpected situation forced a change of plan or outcome.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard formula in announcements and notices)
   
   **Synonyms**: due to unforeseen circumstances, because of unexpected events, as a result of unanticipated factors
   
   **Antonyms**: despite clear planning, in spite of careful preparation
   
   **When to Use**: Use in formal or semi-formal communication when you need to reference unexpected events without detailing them, especially in cancellations, delays, or policy changes.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Overuse without any specificity can sound like empty corporate jargon. Avoid in contexts where transparency is required (e.g., internal post‑mortems) or when the circumstances were in fact predictable.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - due to unforeseen circumstances
   - as a result of unforeseen circumstances
   - owing to unforeseen operational circumstances
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: "Unforeseen" strongly collocates with "circumstances" in formal English; combined with "owing to" it forms a standard, almost formulaic way to signal external, unexpected causes.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing (attributable) + to + unforeseen (not anticipated) + circumstances (situations, conditions)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The concert was cancelled owing to unforeseen circumstances, but they promised a new date soon.
   - Our trip plans changed at the last minute owing to unforeseen family circumstances.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The session has been postponed owing to unforeseen circumstances arising during venue preparation.

1. **Expression**: owing to circumstances beyond our control (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A stock expression emphasizing that the cause of a negative outcome lay outside the speaker’s or organization’s influence.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common in corporate and public announcements)
   
   **Synonyms**: due to factors beyond our control, because of events outside our control, as a result of external constraints
   
   **Antonyms**: owing to our decision..., because we chose..., due to internal factors
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you must communicate bad news (delays, cancellations, disruptions) and it is genuinely driven by external factors (weather, regulators, third‑party failures).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: If internal mistakes or planning failures were the main cause. Overuse risks sounding like blame‑shifting.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - owing to circumstances beyond our control, we have had to...
   - owing to factors beyond our control, ...
   - owing to conditions beyond our control, ...
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: "Circumstances beyond our control" is a conventional legal‑sounding way to disclaim direct responsibility; "owing to" foregrounds attribution while keeping the tone formal and impersonal.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing to (attributable to) + circumstances (conditions) + beyond our control (outside our ability to influence)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The show’s off tonight owing to circumstances beyond our control, but your tickets will be valid for the next date.
   - Shipping’s delayed owing to circumstances beyond our control—mainly the carrier’s backlog.

   **Meaning**: 
   - A frequent collocation used in public notices to attribute changes or disruptions to severe weather.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard pairing in transport and safety messaging)
   
   **Synonyms**: due to bad weather, because of severe weather, as a result of inclement weather
   
   **Antonyms**: despite the good weather, in spite of favourable conditions
   
   **When to Use**: Use in transport alerts, event notices, and safety announcements when bad weather is the primary cause of disruption.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the real cause is operational or organizational rather than weather‑related. Avoid in very casual speech, where "because of the weather" is simpler.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - owing to adverse weather conditions, ...
   - owing to severe weather conditions, ...
   - owing to inclement weather, ...
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Adverse" and "conditions" strongly co‑occur in formal risk and safety language; with "weather" they create a standard noun phrase that fits naturally after "owing to".
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing to + adverse (unfavourable) + weather + conditions
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The flight was cancelled owing to adverse weather conditions at the destination airport.
   - The match was postponed owing to adverse weather conditions on the pitch.

   **Meaning**: 
   - A pattern used to indicate that something is mainly or partly caused by a particular factor, acknowledging that other factors also play a role.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (degree adverb + "owing to" is highly productive)
   
   **Synonyms**: largely because of, mainly due to, partly as a result of, primarily attributable to
   
   **Antonyms**: not owing to..., independent of..., unrelated to...
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want to be precise about causation without oversimplifying: *"The improvement was largely owing to better coordination, and partly owing to extra budget."*
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When one cause clearly dominates and nuance isn’t needed (simple "owing to" may be clearer). Avoid piling up too many adverbs ("mostly largely partly").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - largely owing to
   - partly owing to
   - primarily owing to
   - only marginally owing to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: Degree adverbs such as "largely" and "partly" combine naturally with causal prepositional phrases, signaling proportional responsibility.
   
   **Root Analysis**: degree adverb (largely/partly) + owing to (attributable to)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The delay was largely owing to last‑minute changes from the client.
   - Their success was partly owing to good timing.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Revenue growth was largely owing to new subscriptions, with renewals playing a secondary role.

   **When to Use**: Use in status pages, service banners, broadcast messages, or internal updates when a technical fault is the direct cause of disruption.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the issue is not actually technical (for example, organizational or legal). Overuse without detail may frustrate technical audiences.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - owing to technical difficulties, ...
   - owing to a technical issue, ...
   - owing to technical problems with [system], ...
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Technical difficulties" is a standard vague label for IT problems; paired with "owing to" it becomes a conventional, formulaic explanation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing to + technical (specialized/mechanical) + difficulties (problems)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The stream cut out owing to technical difficulties on the platform.
   - Our call dropped a few times owing to technical difficulties with the connection.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Variations**: 
   - owing to regulatory requirements, ...
   - owing to new regulatory requirements, ...
   - owing to strict regulatory requirements, ...
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Regulatory requirements" is a core phrase in legal and compliance writing; paired with "owing to," it signals external, non‑negotiable constraints.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing to + regulatory (relating to rules) + requirements (things that must be met)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We have to ask for more documents owing to regulatory requirements.
   - The signup flow feels long, but a lot of that is owing to regulatory requirements.
