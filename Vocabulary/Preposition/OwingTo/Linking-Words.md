1. **Linking Word**: owing to (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal causal connector used to introduce the reason for a situation, typically followed by a noun phrase.
   - *Function*: Marks an explicit cause→effect relationship, often at the beginning of a sentence to foreground the reason.
   
   **Synonyms**: due to, because of, on account of, as a result of, by reason of
   
   **Antonyms**: despite, in spite of, notwithstanding, regardless of, although (for clauses)
   
   **When to Use**: Use when you want a formal alternative to "because of" in writing: *"Owing to adverse weather, the event was cancelled."* Works well in notices, reports, and academic or business texts, especially in British English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal and stiff for very casual speech (prefer "because of"). Avoid before finite clauses ("owing to it rained" ✗); use a noun phrase instead ("owing to the rain" ✓).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: 
     - Owing to [noun phrase], [main clause effect].
     - [Main clause effect] owing to [noun phrase].
   - **Position**: 
     - Sentence-initial to emphasize the cause: "Owing to a power failure, operations were suspended."
     - Mid-sentence after the subject or verb: "Operations were suspended owing to a power failure."
   - **Punctuation**: 
     - When sentence-initial, usually followed by a comma in formal writing.
     - When mid-sentence, no comma is usually required unless for emphasis.
   - **Common errors to avoid**: 
     - Using it with a clause: *"Owing to he was late"* ✗ → *"Owing to his lateness"* ✓.
     - Doubling with other causal markers: *"The reason is owing to..."* ✗ → *"The reason is..."* or *"It is owing to..."*.
   
   **Root Analysis**: owing (present participle of "owe" = be indebted/attributable) + to (preposition expressing attribution/direction)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English *āgan* (to possess/owe) → "owe" → "owing" in the sense of "attributable"; "owing to" developed in Early Modern English as a prepositional phrase meaning "attributable to" and then generalized to formal causal use.
