1. **Functional Expression**: Owing to [noun phrase], [result clause]. (function: formal reason-giving)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A formal pattern for introducing an objective reason before stating its effect. It frames the cause as a factual circumstance rather than personal opinion.
   - *Formality*: formal to semi-formal
   - *Directness*: direct but impersonal
   
   **Synonyms**: Because of [NP]..., Due to [NP]..., As a result of [NP]..., On account of [NP]...
   
   **Antonyms**: Despite [NP]..., In spite of [NP]..., Notwithstanding [NP]...
   
   **When to Use**: Use in emails, reports, or announcements when you want to foreground the reason first: *"Owing to unforeseen delays, the launch has been rescheduled."* Useful when the cause is external or uncontrollable.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for very casual talk; avoid when you want to emphasize personal agency or emotion rather than neutral cause (then use "because" + clause).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Owing to unforeseen circumstances, ...
   - Owing to technical issues, ...
   - Owing to health reasons, ...
   - Owing to budget constraints, ...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Shifts focus away from people and onto circumstances, which can soften blame. Frequently used when explaining delays, cancellations, or changes beyond one’s control.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - I see, so that’s why...
   - Understood—what’s the new plan?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Owing to traffic, we got here late, so let’s just grab takeout.

1. **Functional Expression**: This is (largely/partly) owing to [noun phrase]. (function: attributing cause/explaining)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to explain a result by explicitly attributing it to one or more key factors, often with a degree marker ("largely," "partly").
   - *Formality*: neutral to formal
   - *Directness*: direct, analytical
   
   **Synonyms**: This is mainly because of..., This is largely due to..., This can be attributed to..., This stems primarily from...

   **Common Variations**: 
   - This is largely owing to...
   - This is partly owing to...
   - This is primarily owing to...
   - This is only marginally owing to...
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The degree adverb lets you acknowledge complexity while still naming a main driver. Good for balancing honesty with nuance.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That makes sense; what other factors are involved?
   - So it’s mostly owing to X, then?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the decision is actually strategic or voluntary rather than forced; then use more direct ownership language.
