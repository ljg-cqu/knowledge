# Unto - Linking Words & Discourse Markers

1. **Linking Word**: unto this day (type: temporal connector – continuity)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Connects a past event with the present, emphasising that its result or memory still continues.
   - *Function / Logical relationship*: marks persistence over time; links narrative past to "now".
   
   **Synonyms**: to this day, even now, up to now, still today
   
   **Antonyms**: no longer, not anymore, only in former times, once but not now
   
   **When to Use**: Suitable in historical, narrative, or devotional style when you want a past action (blessing, curse, custom, name) to feel still active or visible in the present.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For neutral modern prose, prefer "to this day". In casual conversation, "even now" or "still" sounds more natural than "unto this day".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: 
     - "It is called X *unto this day*."
     - "The monument stands there *unto this day*."
   - **Position**: clause‑final time phrase.
   - **Punctuation**: usually preceded by a comma in longer sentences: "…, and it remains so unto this day." 
   - **Common errors**: Avoid mixing with slang in the same clause (register clash).
   
   **Root Analysis**: 
   - *unto*: un‑ (up to/toward) + to (direction, endpoint).
   - *this day*: deictic pointer to the time of speaking/writing.
   
   **Etymology**: Fixed formula from early English Bible translations and chronicles, preserving *unto* where modern English prefers "to".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The legend says the old tower still leans over the river unto this day.
   - That small act of kindness has shaped their family story unto this day.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The boundary stone, once set, has remained in that field unto this day.
   - Many of the customs described in the chronicle are observed unto this day.

1. **Linking Word**: from … unto … (type: range connector – space/time/scope)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a span between two limits in space, time, or scope ("from A unto B").
   - *Function / Logical relationship*: marks extent or coverage of an action, influence, or rule.
   
   **Synonyms**: from … to …, between … and …, across … to …, stretching from … to …
   
   **Antonyms**: confined to …, only in …, limited to …, within … but not beyond
   
   **When to Use**: In elevated narrative, proclamations, or hymns describing sweeping reach ("from the river unto the ends of the earth"). Works well when you want a slightly archaic or scriptural tone.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In modern neutral prose, "from … to …" is standard. Avoid in technical or legal writing unless consciously echoing an older document.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Spatial**: "from the sea *unto* the mountains".
   - **Temporal**: "from the first watch *unto* the breaking of the day".
   - **Scope**: "from the least *unto* the greatest".
   - **Position**: usually mid‑clause.
   - **Punctuation**: commas may bracket long range phrases: "from the river, even unto the farthest shore, …".
   - **Common errors**: Do not combine with another range marker (avoid "from A until unto B").
   
   **Root Analysis**: 
   - *from*: starting point.
   - *unto*: endpoint or direction.
   
   **Etymology**: Mirrors Semitic and Latin range formulas; translators chose "unto" as a weightier endpoint marker than simple "to".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The festival draws visitors from tiny villages unto the capital city.
   - Word of the protest spread from one chat group unto the next.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: until the end, right to the end, all the way to the finish, to the very last
   
   **Antonyms**: only for a while, at first but not to the end, for a season, half‑way
   
   **When to Use**: In exhortations and memorials ("faithful unto the end", "endure unto the end") where perseverance is being highlighted.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For simple schedule information; "until the end" is clearer and more neutral.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - "remain faithful *unto the end*".
   - "hold fast *unto the end*".
   - "press on *unto the end* of the race".
   - **Position**: clause‑final.
   - **Common errors**: Avoid stacking too many temporal markers (e.g., "until unto the end").
   
   **Root Analysis**: 
   - *unto*: up to.
   - *the end*: final point in time or process.
   
   **Etymology**: Frequent in older devotional and historical writing to stress finishing well rather than starting well.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The film shows a friendship that stays strong unto the end.

   **Meaning**: 
   - Adds emphasis to how far an action or state reaches: not just up to a point, but surprisingly or fully so.
   - *Function / Logical relationship*: amplifies extent; often used with extreme or poetic limits.
   
   **Synonyms**: even to, right up to, all the way to, as far as
   
   **Antonyms**: only to, short of, not reaching as far as, limited to
   
   **When to Use**: In rhetorical, poetic, or devotional style ("even unto the uttermost part of the sea") when you want to stress remarkable reach.

   - "reaches *even unto* the heavens".
   - "extends *even unto* the ends of the earth".
   - "affects people *even unto* the next generation".
   - **Position**: mid‑phrase, immediately before the limit phrase.
   - **Common errors**: Do not overuse; too many "even unto" phrases can sound melodramatic.
   
   **Root Analysis**: 
   - *even*: intensifier, meaning "to an unexpected degree".
   - *unto*: up to a limit.
   
   **Etymology**: Built on older English preference for stacking "even" as an emphasiser before prepositional phrases.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The joke spread even unto relatives who never use social media.

   **Synonyms**: through all generations, for every generation, age after age, from parents to children and beyond
   
   **Antonyms**: for this generation only, for a time, for now, not for future generations
   
   **When to Use**: In blessings, promises, charters, and mission statements that claim long‑term relevance or effect.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For short‑term campaigns or products; using "unto all generations" there sounds exaggerated.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - "a statute *unto all generations*".
   - "be a blessing *unto all generations*".
   - "His faithfulness is *unto all generations*." 
   - **Position**: clause‑final scope phrase.

   **Root Analysis**: 
   - *unto*: up to and including.
   - *all generations*: every successive age or family line.
   
   **Etymology**: Strongly associated with biblical covenant and hymn language, where promises or praise are said to last "unto all generations".
