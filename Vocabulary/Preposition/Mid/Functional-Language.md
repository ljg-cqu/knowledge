1. **Functional Expression**: Sorry to cut you off mid-sentence, but [reason/interruption]. (function: polite interruption / turn-taking)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite way to interrupt someone while they are speaking, especially when you need to add urgent information, correct a fact, or move the conversation.
   - *Formality*: neutral to informal (can be adapted to semi-formal meetings).
   - *Directness*: indirect softening of a direct interruption.
   
   **Synonyms**: Sorry to interrupt, but..., Im going to jump in here because..., Let me just stop you there for a second..., Can I cut in for a moment?
   
   **Antonyms**: Please go on., I dont want to interrupt., Ill let you finish first. (functions: encouraging continuation)
   
   **When to Use**: When you need to interrupt someone mid-sentence to clarify a point, correct a misunderstanding, or introduce time-sensitive information. Common in team discussions, online calls, and collaborative work where timing matters.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid with very senior stakeholders in highly formal settings (use more formal variants); avoid overuse with people who already feel unheard.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Sorry to jump in mid-sentence, but...
   - Sorry to cut in mid-conversation, but...
   - Sorry to stop you mid-sentence  can I just clarify something?
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The apology + explanation pattern ("Sorry to X, but...") softens the face-threatening act of interrupting. Mentioning "mid-sentence" shows you understand you are breaking the persons flow.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Thats okay, go ahead.
   - Sure, what did you want to add?
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Sorry to cut you off mid-sentence, but were almost out of time. Can you jump to the main point?"
   - "Sorry to stop you mid-sentence  I think we already agreed on that part."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Sorry to cut you off mid-sentence, but Id like to capture this question before we move on."
   - "Sorry to interrupt you mid-sentence; could we clarify the assumptions behind that estimate?"

1. **Functional Expression**: I lost my train of thought mid-sentence. (function: metacommunication about difficulty / self-repair)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to explain that you cannot continue what you were saying because you forgot or became distracted.
   - *Formality*: neutral (suitable for most professional contexts).
   - *Directness*: direct admission of difficulty.
   
   **Synonyms**: I just lost my train of thought., I forgot what I was going to say., My mind went blank for a moment., I got lost mid-sentence there.
   
   **Antonyms**: Let me continue that thought., As I was saying..., To finish that point... (functions: resuming smoothly)
   
   **When to Use**: When you suddenly cannot finish a point mid-sentence and want to be transparent instead of pretending. Helpful in presentations, meetings, and interviews to normalise minor lapses.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid repeating it too often in high-stakes presentations; it may reduce perceived confidence if overused.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Sorry, I lost my train of thought mid-sentence.
   - I went blank mid-sentence; let me restart.
   - I got stuck mid-sentence  give me a second.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Admitting a small lapse can build trust if done calmly. Referring to "mid-sentence" invites listeners to give you a moment to recover rather than jumping in.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Take your time.
   - No worries  you were saying that...
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Sorry, I lost my train of thought mid-sentence. What was I saying?"
   - "I just went blank mid-sentence, probably need more coffee."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "I seem to have lost my train of thought mid-sentence; let me rephrase the argument from the beginning."
   - "I went blank mid-sentence, so Ill summarise the key idea instead."

1. **Functional Expression**: Can we pause mid-meeting for a quick check-in? (function: requesting a pause / process check)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A polite request to stop the main agenda briefly while the meeting is in progress in order to clarify direction, energy, or priorities.
   - *Formality*: neutral to semi-formal.
   - *Directness*: indirect-softened request.
   
   **Synonyms**: Could we take a quick pause here?, Can we stop for a moment and check where we are?, Could we have a mid-meeting check-in?
   
   **Antonyms**: Lets keep going., Well review this at the end., No need to stop now. (functions: maintaining flow)
   
   **When to Use**: When a meeting feels off-track, rushed, or confusing and you want to correct course before the end. "Mid-meeting" signals that the request concerns the current live session, not a future one.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing in tightly timed meetings with fixed agendas unless you are the facilitator; avoid when a pause would derail urgent decision-making.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Can we have a quick mid-meeting check-in on priorities?
   - Could we pause mid-meeting to see if everyones aligned?
   - Lets take a brief mid-meeting reset.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: Framing the pause as a "check-in" or "reset" focuses on group benefit rather than personal discomfort. Including "mid-meeting" emphasises timing without sounding dramatic.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - Thats a good idea  lets pause for a minute.
   - Were short on time, but lets do a very quick check.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Can we pause mid-meeting for a minute? I think were talking past each other."
   - "Lets do a quick mid-meeting check-in on what we actually want from this call."
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Can we pause mid-meeting for a brief alignment check on todays objectives?"
   - "Id like to propose a short mid-meeting pause to confirm the decision criteria."

1. **Functional Expression**: Lets schedule a mid-project check-in. (function: suggesting / planning a review point)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A collaborative suggestion to hold a review or alignment meeting around the middle of a project.
   - *Formality*: neutral business.
   - *Directness*: direct but cooperative suggestion.
   
   **Synonyms**: Lets set up a mid-project review., We should plan a mid-project checkpoint., Could we arrange a mid-project touchpoint?
   
   **Antonyms**: Lets just review at the end., We dont need a mid-project review., Lets wait until its finished. (functions: rejecting interim checks)
   
   **When to Use**: Use in project planning and stakeholder alignment to propose a structured moment in the middle of a timeline to re-evaluate goals, risks, or scope.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very short projects where a mid-point review would add unnecessary overhead; avoid when a continuous, lightweight check-in system is already in place.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - Lets build in a mid-project review milestone.
   - Can we schedule a formal mid-project review with stakeholders?
   - We should plan for a mid-project health check.
   
   **Pragmatic Notes**: The phrase "mid-project" signals balance: not over-controlling (constant check-ins) but also not neglecting risks until the end. It sounds pragmatic and professional.
   
   **Response Patterns**: 
   - That makes sense  lets put it on the calendar.
   - Agreed; a mid-project check-in would help manage expectations.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - "Lets schedule a mid-project check-in so we dont get any surprises."

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - "Lets schedule a mid-project check-in to review scope, budget, and emerging risks."
   - "The governance plan includes a formal mid-project check-in with executive sponsors."
