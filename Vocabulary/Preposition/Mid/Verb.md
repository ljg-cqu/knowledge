1. **Verb**: interrupt
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To stop someone from speaking or doing something by saying or doing something yourself.
   - *(Sense 2)* (Transitive) To break the continuity of an action, process, or event.
   
   **Synonyms**: cut off, break in, disturb, disrupt, halt
   
   **Antonyms**: continue, allow, let finish, sustain
   
   **When to Use**: Use when something stops another action before it is finished. With "mid", it appears in expressions like "interrupt someone mid-sentence" or "interrupt the game mid-play" to highlight that the break happens in the middle.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the stop is gentle or scheduled (use "pause" or "break"); "interrupt" can sound more forceful or rude.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - interrupt someone mid-sentence
   - interrupt a meeting mid-discussion
   - alarms that interrupt sleep mid-night
   
   **Root Analysis**: inter- (between) + rupt (from Latin "rumpere" meaning to break)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "interrumpere" (to break between) → Old French "interrupre" → English "interrupt".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He interrupted me mid-sentence just to check his phone.

   **Synonyms**: interrupt, break off, terminate, disconnect, shut off
   
   **Antonyms**: let finish, reconnect, restore, continue
   
   **When to Use**: Common in speech for sudden interruption, especially "cut someone off mid-sentence" or "the call was cut off mid-conversation"; sounds informal to neutral and is very frequent.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing where "interrupt" or "terminate" may sound more appropriate; avoid where the stop is gentle or gradual.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - cut someone off mid-sentence
   - get cut off mid-call
   - be cut off mid-conversation
   
   **Root Analysis**: cut (to sever) + off (particle indicating separation)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "cyttan" (to cut) + "off" → phrasal verb "cut off" for literal and figurative separation.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I hate being cut off mid-sentence.
   - The video got cut off mid-stream when the Wi‑Fi died.

   **Synonyms**: break, halt briefly, stop for a moment, take a break
   
   **Antonyms**: resume, continue, proceed, carry on
   
   **When to Use**: Use when an action stops only temporarily. With "mid", it appears in ideas like "pause mid-sentence", "pause mid-step", or "pause mid-project" to show a short break in the middle.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the stop is final (use "end" or "cancel"); avoid when nothing resumes later.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - pause mid-sentence to think
   - pause mid-presentation
   - pause mid-task to reassess
   
   **Root Analysis**: paus- (from Latin "pausa" meaning a stopping) + zero suffix

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - She paused mid-sentence, trying to find the right word.

   **Synonyms**: restart, continue, pick up again, recommence
   
   **Antonyms**: stop, abandon, discontinue, cancel
   
   **When to Use**: Use when an activity continues after an interruption. In mid‑contexts you may see "resume mid-" something, such as "resume mid-season" or "resume mid-conversation" after a break.

   - resume play mid-game after a delay
   - resume work mid-project following a review
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (again) + sume (from Latin "sumere" meaning to take)

   **Examples [Casual]**:

   **Antonyms**: persist unchanged, stay the course, remain fixed

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - pivot mid-project
   - pivot mid-campaign
   - pivot mid-crisis to a new model
   
   **Root Analysis**: pivot (from French "pivot" meaning axis or pin)
