1. **Expression**: mid-sentence apology (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An apology that someone starts or offers while they are still in the middle of speaking about something else; an interruption of ones own sentence to apologise.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (natural but flexible; components can vary).
   
   **Synonyms**: apology mid-sentence, sudden apology while speaking, on-the-spot apology
   
   **Antonyms**: delayed apology, no apology, carefully prepared apology
   
   **When to Use**: Use when describing emotionally charged or self-correcting moments in which someone realises mid-sentence that they have overstepped and apologises. Works well in narratives about conflict, miscommunication, or social awkwardness.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the apology is planned or delivered later; then "formal apology" or "public apology" is better.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - apologise mid-sentence
   - mid-sentence correction and apology
   - offer a quick mid-sentence sorry
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Mid-sentence" highlights being in the middle of speaking; pairing it with "apology" captures a specific, vivid social move where someone interrupts themselves to repair a misstep.
   
   **Root Analysis**: mid (middle) + sentence (unit of language) + apology (from Greek "apologia" meaning a defence)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He caught himself and gave a mid-sentence apology for how harsh he sounded.
   - I blurted it out and then, mid-sentence, apologised for being rude.

   **Synonyms**: in-flight emergency, emergency mid-flight, onboard emergency
   
   **Antonyms**: smooth flight, uneventful journey, incident-free trip
   
   **When to Use**: Use in aviation, travel, or news contexts to describe critical incidents that happen while the plane is in the middle of its journey.

   **Common Variations**: 
   - handle a mid-flight emergency
   - divert due to a mid-flight emergency
   - mid-flight medical emergency
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Mid-flight" precisely anchors the timing; "emergency" signals seriousness. Together they form a concise, vivid label used widely in media and aviation communication.

   **When to Use**: Use when describing people who move into a different profession or industry after years of experience in another area.

   **Common Variations**:

   - consider a mid-career switch into tech
   - support mid-career switches
   
   **Why This Partnership**:

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We did a big mid-project pivot once we saw the early feedback.
