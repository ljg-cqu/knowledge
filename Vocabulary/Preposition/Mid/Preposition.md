1. **Preposition**: mid (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* In the middle of a space or movement, especially when something happens while an action is still in progress (for example, "mid-air", "mid-step").
   - *(Temporal)* In the middle part of a time period, stage, or sequence (for example, "mid-July", "mid-semester", "mid-game").
   - *(Abstract)* In the middle of an activity, process, or situation, often highlighting interruption, change, or transition (for example, "mid-conversation", "mid-crisis", "mid-career").
   
   **Synonyms**: in the middle of (spatial/temporal), halfway through (temporal/process), in mid‑ [noun], in the midst of (formal), partway through
   
   **Antonyms**: at the beginning of, at the start of, at the end of, after, before
   
   **When to Use**: Use "mid" directly before a noun to emphasize that something happens in the central part of a period, event, or process, especially when it is cut short, suddenly changed, or still unfinished. It is common in headlines, storytelling, and everyday speech ("He left mid-game", "She switched careers mid-life").
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use "mid" on its own without a following noun (*"He left mid"* ✗). Avoid in very formal academic writing where precise time expressions ("in the second quarter", "in week 3") or "in the middle of" are clearer. Avoid when there is no real sense of being in the middle (use "before" or "after" instead).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: mid-game, mid-flight, mid-air, mid-sentence, mid-conversation, mid-crisis, mid-season, mid-career, mid-journey, mid-morning, mid-afternoon
   - **Verb + prep**: stop mid-sentence, freeze mid-step, leave mid-game, pivot mid-project, change jobs mid-career, wake up mid-flight
   - **Adjective + prep**: stuck mid-air, interrupted mid-sentence, exhausted mid-season, uncertain mid-career
   - **Noun + prep**: mid-season slump, mid-game break, mid-career switch, mid-project review, mid-course correction
   
   **Root Analysis**: mid (from Old English "midd" meaning "middle, centre"), used both as a free word and as a bound prefix (mid‑ + noun: "midday", "midlife", "midterm").
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "midde"/"midd" (middle) → Middle English "mid" (in the middle of) → Modern English "mid" used especially before nouns, times, and dates ("mid-October", "mid-2020s", "mid-game") to mark the central part of something.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - He hung up on me mid-sentence, right when I was about to explain everything.
   - The lights went out mid-game, so we had to finish the match the next day.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The aircraft was diverted back to the airport mid-flight after a warning light appeared in the cockpit.
   - She completed a mid-career transition into data science after a decade in traditional finance.
