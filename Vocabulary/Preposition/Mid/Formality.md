1. **Original Expression**: He hung up on me mid-sentence.  
   **Context**: Personal complaint about a phone call ending abruptly while the speaker was still talking.

   **Core Intent**: To express that someone ended the call in a rude, abrupt way before the speaker could finish their point.

   **Casual**: He just hung up on me right in the middle of what I was saying.  
   *Characteristics*: Everyday vocabulary ("just", "right in the middle"), clear emotional tone, no hedging.  
   *Use when*: Talking to friends or close colleagues about feeling dismissed or disrespected.

   **Semi-Formal**: He ended the call while I was still mid-sentence.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral verb ("ended"), keeps "mid-sentence" as a precise descriptor, less emotional colouring.  
   *Use when*: Describing the incident in a professional setting (e.g., team debrief, email) without sounding overly dramatic.

   **Formal**: The call was terminated while I was in mid-sentence.  
   *Characteristics*: Passive construction ("was terminated"), formal verb choice, maintains "in mid-sentence" as an objective time marker.  
   *Use when*: Documenting events in reports, complaints, or formal correspondence.

   **Humorous**: He basically rage-quit the call mid-sentence before I even got to the main point.  
   *Characteristics*: Playful hyperbole ("rage-quit"), informal gaming slang, humorous framing of rudeness.  
   *Use when*: Venting with friends or teammates who share your sense of humour.  
   *Avoid when*: The situation is serious or the relationship is sensitive.

   **Lively**: He slammed the call down mid-sentence and left me talking to the dial tone.  
   *Characteristics*: Vivid imagery ("slammed", "talking to the dial tone"), energetic storytelling tone.  
   *Use when*: Telling a story, engaging an audience, emphasising how abrupt it felt.

   **Empathetic**: He hung up mid-sentence, and I felt completely shut down.  
   *Characteristics*: Focuses on feelings ("felt completely shut down"), emotionally honest, softer verbs.  
   *Use when*: Sharing how the event affected you emotionally, in coaching, counselling, or close relationships.

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use semi-formal or formal variants when describing the incident to managers or HR; casual or humorous with peers.
   - *Social Distance*: The closer the relationship, the more casual you can be; with strangers or external partners, stay neutral.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For repeated disrespect or abuse, prefer formal/empathetic framing over jokes.
   - *Medium*: Written complaints or emails favour formal/semi-formal; spoken venting allows casual/lively.

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Making the tone too light (humorous) when the listener expects a serious complaint.
   - Overusing "rage-quit" or similar slang in professional contexts, which can undermine credibility.
   - Omitting your own reaction when you actually need emotional validation.

   **Cultural Notes**: In many cultures, hanging up mid-sentence is seen as strongly disrespectful. Some business cultures expect a very neutral description first, followed by interpretation.

   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Emailing HR about repeated incidents → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal: "The call was terminated while I was in mid-sentence."
   - **Situation 2**: Talking with a close friend → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual/Humorous: "He just hung up on me right in the middle of what I was saying."
   - **Situation 3**: Team retrospective → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal/Empathetic: "He ended the call while I was still mid-sentence, and it felt quite dismissive."

1. **Original Expression**: She walked out mid-meeting without saying anything.  
   **Context**: Workplace description of someone leaving a meeting in the middle.

   **Core Intent**: To report that a participant left during a meeting in a way that seemed unusual or problematic.

   **Casual**: She just got up and walked out in the middle of the meeting without a word.  
   *Characteristics*: Informal intensifier ("just"), conversational rhythm, clear judgement.

   **Semi-Formal**: She left the room mid-meeting without offering any explanation.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral verbs ("left", "offering"), keeps "mid-meeting" to emphasise timing, non-emotional description.  
   *Use when*: Internal reports, manager-to-manager conversations, written summaries.

   **Formal**: She exited the meeting while it was still in progress and did not provide a reason.  
   *Characteristics*: Fully neutral, removes idiomatic "walked out", does not speculate on motives.  
   *Use when*: Formal documentation, HR records, sensitive escalations.

   **Humorous**: She pulled a dramatic mid-meeting exit and left everyone staring at the door.  
   *Characteristics*: Light exaggeration ("pulled a dramatic..."), playful tone.  
   *Use when*: With trusted colleagues who share the same reading of the event.  
   *Avoid when*: The person is present or the stakes are high.

   **Lively**: Halfway through the meeting, she stood up, walked out mid-discussion, and the whole room went silent.  
   *Characteristics*: Storytelling style, sequential verbs, strong visual picture.  
   *Use when*: Recounting the event to an engaged audience or in a narrative report.

   **Empathetic**: She left mid-meeting without a word; it looked like she was overwhelmed.  
   *Characteristics*: Softens judgement, acknowledges possible emotional strain.  
   *Use when*: Discussing well-being, in coaching/HR contexts, or when you want to preserve relationships.

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal/semi-formal when talking upward or in writing; reserve casual/humorous for horizontal peer talk.
   - *Social Distance*: The less you know about her situation, the more careful and neutral you should be.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For potential burnout or conflict, lean toward empathetic framing.
   - *Medium*: Meeting minutes require neutral/semi-formal; private debriefs may allow more colour.

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using "walked out" in formal documents, which can sound accusatory.
   - Assuming motives ("stormed out") instead of describing behaviour.
   - Using humour where psychological safety is already low.

   **Cultural Notes**: In some workplace cultures, leaving mid-meeting without explanation is seen as a serious breach of etiquette; in others, stepping out briefly is acceptable if signalled.

   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Neutral minutes summary → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal: "She exited the meeting while it was still in progress and did not provide a reason."
   - **Situation 2**: Private chat with a peer → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual: "She just got up and walked out in the middle of the meeting."
   - **Situation 3**: Well-being check with HR → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic: "She left mid-meeting without a word; it looked like she was overwhelmed."

1. **Original Expression**: We pivoted mid-project after seeing the first results.  
   **Context**: Project or startup team describing a strategic change in the middle of execution.

   **Core Intent**: To say that the team changed direction while the project was already underway, not at the planning stage.

   **Casual**: We changed course halfway through the project once we saw how things were going.  
   *Characteristics*: Everyday verbs ("changed course"), "halfway through" instead of "mid-project"; relaxed tone.

   **Semi-Formal**: We adjusted our approach mid-project in response to the initial data.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral verbs ("adjusted", "approach"), keeps "mid-project" as precise timing phrase.  
   *Use when*: Status updates, internal presentations, project documentation.

   **Humorous**: We did a classic mid-project pivot when we realised the original idea made no sense in the real world.  
   *Characteristics*: Light self-deprecation, keeps "mid-project pivot" phrase for startup flavour.  
   *Use when*: Internal retrospectives, informal talks, startup meetups.  
   *Avoid when*: Communicating with risk-averse or very traditional stakeholders.

   **Lively**: Mid-project, we hit the brakes, spun the wheel, and headed in a completely new direction.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphorical driving imagery, energetic verbs, dramatic storytelling.

   **Empathetic**: Mid-project, we had to rethink our direction, which was stressful but ultimately necessary.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges emotional load ("stressful"), frames change as growth rather than failure.

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal/semi-formal for executives; casual/humorous for team-level reflection.
   - *Social Distance*: With external clients, emphasise "revised" and "analysis"; internally, "pivot" is more acceptable.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: If the change involved major cost or risk, tone down humour.
   - *Medium*: Slide decks and written reports favour semi-formal/formal; talks and retrospectives can be lively.

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Overusing "pivot" as a buzzword without explaining the actual change.
   - Hiding the reasons for a mid-project change, which undermines trust.
   - Sounding too proud of constant pivots, which may signal instability.

   **Cultural Notes**: Startup cultures often celebrate mid-project pivots as agility; more traditional sectors may see them as poor planning unless well-justified.

   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Steering committee update → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal: "The project strategy was revised mid-project following analysis of early-stage results."
   - **Situation 2**: Internal retrospective → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal/Humorous: "We adjusted our approach mid-project in response to the initial data."
   - **Situation 3**: Founder talk at a meetup → **Appropriate Variant**: Humorous/Lively: "We did a classic mid-project pivot once reality hit."

1. **Original Expression**: She made a mid-career switch into data science.

   **Core Intent**: To highlight that someone changed fields after many years in a previous career path.

   **Casual**: She totally switched careers halfway through her working life and went into data science.  
   *Characteristics*: Emphatic adverb ("totally"), "halfway through her working life" instead of "mid-career".

   **Semi-Formal**: She made a mid-career transition from finance into data science.  
   *Characteristics*: Professional vocabulary ("transition"), keeps "mid-career" to anchor timing, neutral tone.

   **Empathetic**: Mid-career, she had the courage to leave a familiar path and start again in data science.  
   *Characteristics*: Emphasises emotional effort ("courage"), validates difficulty of change, supportive tone.

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal/semi-formal in written bios and recommendations; casual/lively when she tells her own story.
   - *Social Distance*: With mentees, empathetic and lively variants can be motivating; with selection committees, formal is safer.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high-risk personal decisions, frame with empathy rather than jokes.
   - *Medium*: Resumes and official profiles favour semi-formal/formal; talks and podcasts allow lively/humorous.

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Downplaying the difficulty of a mid-career switch, which can feel invalidating to others.
   - Using overly casual language in very traditional industries.
   - Focusing only on escape from the old field instead of growth into the new one.

   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, mid-career switches are becoming more accepted; in others, a linear path is still ideal. The term "mid-career" itself can be reassuring (not ";too late"), especially for adult learners.

   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Short bio for a conference → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal: "She made a mid-career transition from finance into data science."
   - **Situation 2**: Informal podcast interview → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively/Humorous: "She pulled a full mid-career plot twist and rebranded herself as a data scientist."
