   **Synonyms**: uncomfortable, embarrassing, clumsy, tense, uneasy
   
   **Antonyms**: smooth, natural, relaxed, comfortable, easy

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - awkward mid-conversation silence
   - awkward pause mid-sentence
   - awkward mid-meeting interruption
   
   **Root Analysis**: awk (from Old Norse "afugr" meaning turned the wrong way) + -ward (direction suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old Norse "afugr" → Middle English "awk" (back-handed, clumsy) + -ward → "awkward" (clumsy, socially uncomfortable).

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - unfinished mid-project work

   **Root Analysis**: un- (not) + finish (from Old French "finir") + -ed (past participle used adjectivally)
