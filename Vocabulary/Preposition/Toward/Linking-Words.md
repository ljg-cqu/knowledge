# Linking Words: Toward

1. **Linking Word**: toward (type: preposition functioning as connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to indicate direction, purpose, or goal; connects actions with their intended outcomes or destinations
   - *Function*: Expresses directional relationship between action and goal; indicates purpose or intended result
   
   **Synonyms**: to, in the direction of, for the purpose of, with the aim of, in pursuit of
   
   **Antonyms**: away from, against, contrary to, opposite to
   
   **When to Use**: Use to link actions with goals, directions with destinations, attitudes with objects; appropriate when expressing movement, development, or orientation in any register
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Don't confuse "toward" (direction/goal) with "to" (arrival/completion); "toward" implies movement in direction without necessarily reaching; avoid overuse in single sentence
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Action/Movement] + toward + [Goal/Destination]: working toward completion, moving toward agreement
   - [Attitude/Feeling] + toward + [Object]: friendly toward newcomers, hostile toward change
   - [Position]: sentence-final common (leaning toward), mid-sentence after verb (shifted toward)
   - [Punctuation]: No special punctuation required; "toward" introduces prepositional phrase
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "towards" vs "toward" (US English prefers "toward", UK allows both); confusing with "to" when completion is meant
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "tōweard" = to (to) + -weard (direction)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "tōweard" (in the direction of) → Middle English "toward/towardes" → Modern English "toward" (American) / "towards" (British variant)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're heading toward the park—want to come?
   - She's been really nice toward me since I started.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The organization is progressing toward achieving its strategic objectives.
   - Public sentiment has shifted significantly toward acceptance of the policy.

2. **Linking Word**: in order to move toward (type: complex prepositional phrase showing purpose)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Expresses purpose or intention; connects an action with the goal or direction it serves
   - *Function*: Indicates purpose relationship—the action is undertaken for the purpose of moving in specified direction
   
   **Synonyms**: to move toward, so as to move toward, for the purpose of moving toward, with a view to moving toward
   
   **Antonyms**: in order to move away from, to avoid moving toward
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explicitly stating purpose or rationale for actions directed toward goals; appropriate in formal, academic, and professional contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: More formal than simple "to"; in casual contexts, "to move toward" is sufficient; avoid when simpler construction conveys same meaning
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Subject + action] + in order to move toward + [goal]: The committee met in order to move toward consensus
   - [Position]: Typically mid-sentence, can be sentence-initial for emphasis
   - [Punctuation]: Often preceded by comma when mid-sentence; no comma when sentence-initial unless followed by long phrase
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Overuse creates heavy, bureaucratic style; mixing with other purpose expressions redundantly
   
   **Root Analysis**: in order (for purpose) + to + move + toward (direction)
   
   **Etymology**: Combination of purpose marker "in order to" + motion verb "move" + directional preposition "toward"; creates explicit purpose-direction construction
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Rarely used in casual speech; simplified to "to move toward"]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The legislation was revised in order to move toward greater transparency in government operations.

   **Antonyms**: without regard to, ignoring, not considering
   
   **When to Use**: Use when explaining strategic rationale or forward-looking planning; appropriate in business, strategic, and formal contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Quite formal; in casual contexts use "thinking about" or "with [goal] in mind"; can sound pompous if overused
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Action] + with a view toward + [future goal/outcome]: investing with a view toward expansion
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-final or mid-sentence after main clause
   - [Punctuation]: Often preceded by comma when non-essential; no comma when essential to meaning
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "with a view toward" (forward-looking) with "in view of" (considering current facts)
   
   **Root Analysis**: with (accompaniment) + view (perspective/consideration) + toward (direction)
   
   **Etymology**: Idiomatic construction combining "view" (mental perspective) with "toward" (future direction) to express purposeful forward planning

   **Synonyms**: as we approach, as we get closer to, as we progress toward, while moving toward
   
   **Antonyms**: as we move away from, as we depart from
   
   **When to Use**: Use when discussing developments over time in relation to approaching goals or deadlines; appropriate for projections, planning, transitions
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When time element is not relevant; when simple "when we reach" is clearer for specific future point
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - As we move toward + [time/goal], [consequence/action]: As we move toward Q4, we'll need more resources
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial, introducing dependent clause
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by comma when sentence-initial; no comma when mid-sentence after independent clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusion between future time reference and goal achievement
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (temporal) + we + move + toward (direction)
   
   **Etymology**: Combines temporal marker "as" with motion-direction phrase "move toward" to create temporal-progressive connector
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - As we move toward the holidays, things are going to get crazy.

   **When to Use**: Use when describing actions that occur simultaneously with goal-directed effort; appropriate for progress reports, narratives of development
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When simultaneity is not important; when simple sequence "then we worked toward" is clearer
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Subject + action] + while working toward + [goal]: We learned valuable lessons while working toward our objectives
   - [Position]: Can be sentence-initial or mid-sentence; flexible placement
   - [Punctuation]: Comma usage depends on position and whether clause is essential
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Creating overly complex sentences with multiple "while" clauses
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (temporal simultaneity) + working + toward (direction/goal)
   
   **Etymology**: Combines temporal conjunction "while" with goal-oriented phrase "working toward" to show simultaneous progressive action
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - While working toward my degree, I also held down two jobs.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Action/Decision], thereby moving toward + [goal]: reduced emissions, thereby moving toward sustainability
   - [Position]: Typically mid-sentence, following independent clause
   - [Punctuation]: Usually preceded by comma; "thereby" connects clauses showing result
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "thereby" without clear causal relationship; overuse in informal contexts
   
   **Root Analysis**: there + by (means) + moving + toward (direction)
   
   **Etymology**: "Thereby" (by that means) combined with "moving toward" to create formal causal-directional connector
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Rarely used in casual speech; simplified to "and that moves us toward"]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The regulation reduces carbon emissions, thereby moving toward environmental sustainability goals.

   - In an effort toward + [goal/noun phrase]: in an effort toward reconciliation, in an effort toward excellence
   - [Position]: Can be sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by comma when sentence-initial

   - [Position]: Typically mid-sentence or sentence-final as participial phrase
   - [Punctuation]: May be preceded by comma if non-essential modifier
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing "leading toward" (causing direction) with "leading to" (causing result)
   
   **Root Analysis**: lead (to guide) + -ing + toward (direction)

   - [Position]: Can appear in various positions; flexible placement
   - [Punctuation]: Standard prepositional phrase punctuation rules apply
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using when single, complete cause exists (use "causing" or "achieving"); confusion with "contributing to"
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + tribute (Latin "tribuere" - to assign) + -ing + toward
   
   **Etymology**: Latin "contribuere" (to bring together, add) → "contribute" + "-ing" + "toward" creates ongoing partial causation with direction
