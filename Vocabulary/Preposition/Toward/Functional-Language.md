   - How do you feel toward...? (more emotional focus)
   - What's your stance toward...? (implies position-taking)

   - Let's take immediate steps toward... (emphasizes urgency)
   - We need to take steps toward... (stronger, less collaborative)

   - How might we approach this toward...? (more tentative)

   - Can we shift this toward...? (more collaborative)
