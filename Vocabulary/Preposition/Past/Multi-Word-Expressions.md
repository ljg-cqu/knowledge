   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The preposition "in" naturally pairs with "past" as a time period/container metaphor; "past" functions as noun requiring locative preposition
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (Old English "in") + the (definite article) + past (from Latin "passus")

   - look back (without "on")
   - looking back on it
   - when I look back on
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Look" (direct attention) + "back" (toward past) + "on" (focusing on object) creates natural metaphor for retrospection

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I used to play soccer every weekend, but my knees can't handle it anymore.
