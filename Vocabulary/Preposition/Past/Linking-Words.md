1. **Linking Word**: when (type: subordinating conjunction)
   **Meaning**: 
   - At or during the time that; introduces a temporal clause indicating simultaneous or sequential actions in the past
   - *Function*: Creates temporal relationship between clauses; can refer to specific moments or periods
   
   **Synonyms**: while, as, at the time that, during the time that
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (functional difference rather than opposite)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "when" to introduce time clauses describing past actions; works with all past tenses; very common and versatile; appropriate for all contexts
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid ambiguity between "when" (time) and "if" (condition); context should clarify
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main clause] + when + [dependent clause describing past time]
   - [Position]: "when" clause can come before or after main clause
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "when" clause comes first; no comma when it comes second
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Mixing tenses incorrectly (maintain consistent past time reference)
   
   **Root Analysis**: when (Old English "hwanne, hwænne" - at what time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwanne" (at what time) → Proto-Germanic "*hwan" → Proto-Indo-European "*kwo-" (who, what)

   **Synonyms**: following, once, when, subsequently to
   
   **Antonyms**: before, prior to, until
   
   **When to Use**: Use "after" to show temporal sequence in past events; indicates the second event followed the first; works with all past tenses
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid ambiguity about which event came first; clear sequence is essential
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main clause] + after + [dependent clause]; or: After + [dependent clause], [main clause]
   - [Position]: "after" clause can introduce or follow main clause
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "after" clause comes first; typically no comma when it follows
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Unclear temporal relationships with multiple events
   
   **Root Analysis**: after (Old English "æfter" - behind, later)

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [main clause] + before + [dependent clause]; or: Before + [dependent clause], [main clause]
   - [Position]: "before" clause can introduce or follow main clause
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "before" clause comes first; typically no comma when it follows
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusion with "before" as preposition vs. conjunction
   
   **Root Analysis**: before (Old English "beforan" - in front of)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "beforan" → "be-" (by) + "foran" (in front) → temporal meaning from spatial

   - [Clause structure]: While + [dependent clause], [main clause]; or: [main clause] + while + [dependent clause]
   - [Position]: flexible positioning
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "while" clause comes first; optional comma when it follows
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing temporal "while" with contrastive "while" (meaning "although")
   
   **Root Analysis**: while (Old English "hwīl" - time, space of time)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "hwīl" (time, period) → used as conjunction "during the time that"

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [present perfect main clause] + since + [past simple time clause]
   - [Position]: "since" clause typically follows main clause but can precede it
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "since" clause comes first
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using past simple with "since" instead of present perfect
   
   **Root Analysis**: since (Middle English "sithenes" - afterward)

   **Synonyms**: while, when, at the time that, during
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A (functional)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "as" to show two past actions occurred simultaneously; slightly more formal than "when" or "while"; common in narratives
   
   **When NOT to Use**: "As" has multiple meanings (time, reason, manner, comparison); ensure context clarifies temporal meaning
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: As + [clause], [main clause]; or: [main clause] + as + [clause]
   - [Position]: flexible positioning
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "as" clause comes first
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Ambiguity between temporal "as" (when) and causal "as" (because)
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (Old English "alswa, eallswa" - quite so, just as)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English "eallswa" (quite so) → Middle English "as" → reduced form with multiple functions

   **Antonyms**: before, until
   
   **When to Use**: Use "once" to show the second action began immediately after the first was completed; emphasizes completion as trigger
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Can be ambiguous with adverbial "once" (one time, formerly); context clarifies
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Once + [past action completed], [subsequent action occurred]
   - [Position]: "once" clause typically comes first but can follow
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma when "once" clause comes first
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Confusing conjunction "once" with adverb "once"
   
   **Root Analysis**: once (Old English "ānes" - genitive of "ān" = one)

   **Synonyms**: till, up to the time that, before
   
   **Antonyms**: since, from, after
   
   **When to Use**: Use "until" to show action/state continued up to a specific past moment and then stopped; marks boundaries of duration
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Distinguish from "by" (deadline). "Until" emphasizes continuation; "by" emphasizes completion before deadline
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [continuous action] + until + [endpoint event]
   - [Position]: "until" clause typically follows main clause
   - [Punctuation]: Comma optional, often omitted
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using negative + "until" incorrectly; double negatives create confusion
   
   **Root Analysis**: until (from Old Norse "und" + till)
   
   **Etymology**: Middle English "until" → Old Norse "*und" (up to) + "till" (to) → Proto-Germanic

   **Synonyms**: when, by the point that, before
   
   **Antonyms**: after, long after
   
   **When to Use**: Use "by the time" to show one past action was completed before another past moment; often with past perfect for earlier action
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Requires clear temporal reference; avoid vague timing
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: By the time + [past action], [already completed action in past perfect]
   - [Position]: "by the time" typically introduces clause
   - [Punctuation]: Use comma after "by the time" clause
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Not using past perfect for the earlier completed action
   
   **Root Analysis**: by (Old English "bī") + the + time (Old English "tīma")
   
   **Etymology**: Phrasal construction: preposition "by" + noun "time" → functions as conjunction

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Previously, [past statement]; or [action] + previously
   - [Position]: typically sentence-initial or mid-sentence
   - [Punctuation]: Comma after sentence-initial "previously"
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Redundancy with other past markers
   
   **Root Analysis**: previous (pre- before + via way) + -ly
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin "praevius" (going before) + adverb suffix "-ly" → functions as discourse marker
