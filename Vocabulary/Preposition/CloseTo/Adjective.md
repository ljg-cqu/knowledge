1. **Adjective**: close (comp: closer, sup: closest)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing something or someone that is very near in space, time, relationship, or degree.
   - Describing a strong personal relationship with a high level of trust and emotional connection.
   - Describing a small difference between two numbers, results, or competitors.
   
   **Synonyms**: near, nearby, intimate, tight, adjacent (for place), similar
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, far, remote, detached, separate
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close" whenever you want to emphasize strong nearness—"a close friend", "a close result", "close neighbors", "close to the deadline". Works in both everyday and professional English, and is the core adjective behind the phrase "close to".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you need to stress strict adjacency ("next to", "adjacent to" may be clearer), or when you want to highlight emotional distance despite physical nearness. Do not confuse with "closed" (not open).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - close friend, close relationship, close family
   - close result, close race, close margin, close call
   - close to tears, close to collapse, close to the limit
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (base) + comparative -r/-er + superlative -st/-est
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *clos* (shut, confined) → Middle English *clos* → English "close" with developed senses of nearness and intimacy.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We've been close friends since primary school.
   - The match was really close—they only won by one point.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The two datasets show close agreement across all measured dimensions.
   - We maintain a close working relationship with our regional partners.

1. **Adjective**: intimate (no irregular forms)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Having a very close and friendly personal relationship; emotionally connected.
   - Involving very private or personal matters.
   
   **Synonyms**: close, deeply connected, familiar, affectionate, warm
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, detached, formal, cold, impersonal
   
   **When to Use**: Use "intimate" to describe relationships that are closer than ordinary friendships, or settings and conversations that involve very personal topics. It strongly overlaps with the idea of being "very close to" someone emotionally.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for neutral professional relationships ("close working relationship" is safer than "intimate working relationship"). In some contexts "intimate" has a romantic or sexual implication, so be cautious in formal or cross-cultural communication.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - intimate friend, intimate partner, intimate relationship
   - intimate knowledge, intimate details, intimate conversation
   - intimate setting, intimate gathering
   
   **Root Analysis**: intim- (inmost, most inward) + -ate (adjective/verb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *intimus* (inmost) → Late Latin *intimatus* → English "intimate", originally meaning "inmost" or "essential" and later extended to close relationships.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're not just colleagues—we're pretty intimate friends at this point.
   - They had an intimate chat about their fears and hopes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants shared intimate accounts of their lived experiences during the interviews.
   - The study requires an intimate understanding of user behavior in high-stress environments.

1. **Adjective**: adjacent (no irregular forms)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Next to or very close to something; sharing a border or wall.
   
   **Synonyms**: next to, adjoining, neighboring, contiguous, side-by-side
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, far away, separate, remote, detached
   
   **When to Use**: Use "adjacent" in technical, formal, or descriptive contexts where two things are immediately next to each other—"adjacent rooms", "adjacent plots", "adjacent cells". It is a more formal way of saying "very close to" or "right next to".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for many casual contexts ("next to" is more natural in everyday speech). Avoid when things are only roughly nearby rather than sharing a boundary.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - adjacent room, adjacent building, adjacent property
   - adjacent cells, adjacent nodes, adjacent countries
   - adjacent to the station, adjacent to the main road
   
   **Root Analysis**: ad- (to, toward) + jac- (throw, lie) + -ent (adjective suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *adjacēre* (to lie near) → Latin *adjacens* → English "adjacent".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our rooms are adjacent—you’re right next door to me.
   - The park is adjacent to the school, so kids can walk there easily.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The new facility is located on land adjacent to the existing campus.
   - Adjacent cells show values close to the theoretical maximum.

1. **Adjective**: approximate (no irregular forms)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Close to the exact number, amount, or description but not completely accurate or final.
   
   **Synonyms**: rough, near, close, inexact, estimated
   
   **Antonyms**: exact, precise, accurate, definite, fixed
   
   **When to Use**: Use "approximate" before numbers, amounts, or shapes when you need to say they are close to the exact value but not exact—"approximate cost", "approximate value", "approximate shape".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for very casual talk ("around", "rough" or "about" feel more natural). Avoid if exact values are required and known.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - approximate value, approximate cost, approximate size
   - approximate time, approximate location, approximate number
   - approximate match, approximate answer
   
   **Root Analysis**: ap- (to, toward) + proxim- (nearest) + -ate (adjective/verb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Late Latin *approximatus* (brought near), based on *proximus* (nearest); English "approximate" keeps the idea of being very close to but not identical with something.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Do you have any approximate idea of how much this will cost?
   - The meeting time is approximate—we’ll start close to three.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The approximate value of the parameter is close to 0.7 under most conditions.
   - Only approximate figures are available at this stage of the analysis.

1. **Adjective**: borderline (no gradable forms in some uses)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Very close to being a particular thing, often just acceptable or just unacceptable; on the edge between two categories.
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, near, marginal, on the edge, on the verge
   
   **Antonyms**: clear-cut, definite, obvious, well within, well beyond
   
   **When to Use**: Use "borderline" to describe cases that are very close to a limit or threshold—"borderline acceptable", "borderline offensive", "borderline pass". It emphasizes that something is very close to changing category.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in strictly positive feedback when you want to be encouraging; "borderline" usually suggests doubt or risk. Not suitable when there is a clear, strong result far from any boundary.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - borderline case, borderline decision, borderline result
   - borderline acceptable, borderline appropriate, borderline offensive
   - borderline pass, borderline fail
   
   **Root Analysis**: border (edge) + -line (mark or limit)
   
   **Etymology**: From "border" + "line"; noun use for boundary; adjectival use developed to describe things close to a boundary between categories.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - His jokes are funny but sometimes borderline offensive.
   - My exam score was borderline—I passed, but only just.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Several indicators fall into a borderline range close to the intervention threshold.
