1. **Adverb**: nearly (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Almost; not quite; very close to being or doing something.
   - Used to indicate approximation or a point just short of completion.
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, practically, virtually, approximately, just about
   
   **Antonyms**: completely, entirely, fully, totally, exactly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "nearly" to say something is close to happening or being true but does not actually reach that point—"nearly finished", "nearly impossible", "nearly 100%". Often appears just before the main verb or adjective.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precision is required (give the exact value). Be careful with negatives in some varieties of English ("not nearly" has a special emphatic meaning: "far from").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - nearly finished, nearly done, nearly complete
   - nearly there, nearly ready, nearly over
   - nearly 50%, nearly everyone, nearly every day
   
   **Root Analysis**: near (close) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *nēar* (nearer) + -ly → Middle English "nerly" → Modern English "nearly".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're nearly there—just a few more minutes.
   - I nearly forgot your birthday, but I set a reminder just in time.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The results nearly match those reported in earlier studies.
   - Production reached nearly full capacity during the final quarter.

1. **Adverb**: almost (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Not quite; very nearly; just short of being or happening.
   
   **Synonyms**: nearly, practically, virtually, just about, all but
   
   **Antonyms**: completely, entirely, fully, definitely, certainly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "almost" to signal that something is very close to being true or complete—"almost there", "almost finished", "almost 90%". Works across casual and formal English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid combining with negative verbs in very formal contexts if it creates ambiguity ("almost didn’t" vs "didn’t almost"). When exactness matters, give a precise value instead.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - almost finished, almost done, almost ready
   - almost everyone, almost every day, almost always
   - almost impossible, almost identical, almost equal to
   
   **Root Analysis**: all (whole) + most (greatest amount)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *ealmǣst* (very nearly the whole) → Middle English "almost".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I almost missed the train this morning.
   - We’re almost close to our fundraising goal.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The intervention produced results that are almost indistinguishable from the control condition.
   - Implementation is almost certain to continue next year.

1. **Adverb**: practically (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Almost; very nearly; in effect if not in strict fact.
   - In a practical manner; realistically (second sense).
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, nearly, virtually, essentially, basically
   
   **Antonyms**: theoretically, completely, entirely, technically (when contrasting theory vs practice)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "practically" to emphasize that for all useful purposes something is very close to a state—"practically finished", "practically empty", "practically the same".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the second sense ("in a practical way") could create ambiguity. In very formal academic writing, "almost" or "virtually" may be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - practically empty, practically full, practically done
   - practically everyone, practically identical, practically impossible
   - practically speaking
   
   **Root Analysis**: practical (useful, realistic) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Greek *praktikos* (concerned with action) → Latin *practicus* → "practical" + -ly; the "almost" meaning arose from "in practical effect".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The place was practically empty by the time we arrived.
   - I practically live at the office these days.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The two methods are practically identical in their outcomes.
   - The project is practically complete, with only minor adjustments remaining.

1. **Adverb**: virtually (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Nearly; almost completely; for all practical purposes.
   - In a virtual or computer-simulated way (technical sense).
   
   **Synonyms**: almost, nearly, practically, essentially, effectively
   
   **Antonyms**: actually, literally, completely, entirely, physically (for the technical sense)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "virtually" to stress that something is so close to a state that the difference hardly matters—"virtually impossible", "virtually all", "virtually certain". Very common in formal written English.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid where it might clash with the technical meaning of "virtual" (online, simulated). Do not use if you need to be absolutely literal and precise; some readers treat "virtually" as hedging.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - virtually impossible, virtually certain, virtually identical
   - virtually all, virtually every, virtually nothing
   - virtually unchanged, virtually eliminated
   
   **Root Analysis**: virtual (effective in essence) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Medieval Latin *virtualis* (effective in fact, not in name) → English "virtual" + -ly; degree meaning follows the "in effect" sense.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Tickets were virtually sold out by the time I checked.
   - I've virtually finished the book—just a few pages left.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The two datasets are virtually identical in their distributions.
   - Operational interruptions have been virtually eliminated since the upgrade.

1. **Adverb**: roughly (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Approximately; not exactly but close enough for a general idea.
   - In a rough or harsh way (second sense).
   
   **Synonyms**: approximately, about, around, close to, more or less
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, accurately, strictly
   
   **When to Use**: Use "roughly" before numbers or measurements when you want to show a value is close to the exact one but not exact—"roughly 50%", "roughly three hours". Emphasizes that you are giving a close estimate, not a precise figure.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid where exact precision is needed (use exact numbers). In some contexts "roughly" can sound casual; "approximately" is safer in highly formal writing.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - roughly 10, roughly half, roughly equal, roughly the same size
   - roughly speaking, roughly estimated, roughly calculated
   
   **Root Analysis**: rough (not smooth; not exact) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English *ruh* (rough, shaggy) → "rough" + -ly; figurative sense of "approximate" developed from "not smooth/finished".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It takes roughly twenty minutes to walk from here to the station.
   - We’ve raised roughly what we need—just a little bit more to go.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The survey reached roughly 2,000 participants across all regions.
   - Costs are roughly comparable to those reported in similar projects.

1. **Adverb**: closely (type: manner/degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - With a lot of attention or care; in a way that pays detailed attention.
   - In a way that involves strong connection or similarity; near in relationship or resemblance.
   
   **Synonyms**: carefully, attentively, thoroughly, intimately, tightly
   
   **Antonyms**: loosely, carelessly, distantly, superficially
   
   **When to Use**: Use "closely" when describing careful monitoring or strong relationships—"watch closely", "work closely with", "closely related to". It often describes how near two things are in relationship or similarity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse "closely" with "close" used as a simple adverb of position ("stand close"). For plain physical nearness without the idea of care or similarity, "close" or "near" is better.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - follow closely, watch closely, examine closely, monitor closely
   - closely related, closely connected, closely aligned, closely tied to
   - work closely with, collaborate closely with
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near, tight) + -ly (adverb suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Middle English "close" + -ly; sense extended from physical tightness to careful attention and strong connection.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Watch closely—I’m only going to show you how to do this once.
   - We’ve been working closely together on this project for months.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The data were examined closely for signs of systematic bias.
   - The two variables are closely associated, with correlation coefficients close to 1.
