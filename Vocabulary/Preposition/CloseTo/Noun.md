1. **Noun**: closeness (U)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The state of being close in space, time, relationship, or degree; physical or emotional nearness.
   - A high degree of similarity or correspondence between things (numbers, results, appearances).
   
   **Synonyms**: nearness, proximity, intimacy, tightness (of relationship), similarity
   
   **Antonyms**: distance, remoteness, separation, detachment, difference
   
   **When to Use**: Use "closeness" when emphasizing how little distance there is—physically, emotionally, or in terms of similarity or numbers. Common in relationship talk ("emotional closeness"), data comparison ("closeness of fit"), and descriptions of tightly connected groups.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very technical spatial contexts where "proximity" is preferred, or when you need to stress the *area* around something ("vicinity"). For strictly financial or legal distance, more precise terms may be clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - emotional closeness, physical closeness, sense of closeness
   - closeness to someone, closeness between people, closeness within a team
   - closeness of results, closeness of fit, closeness of the vote
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near) + -ness (noun suffix indicating state or quality)
   
   **Etymology**: From Middle English *clos* (near, confined) + *-ness*. The noun "closeness" developed to describe both literal proximity and figurative intimacy or similarity.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I really value the closeness we have as a family.
   - The game showed the closeness of the two teams—they were almost evenly matched.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The closeness of the experimental results to the theoretical predictions supports the validity of the model.
   - Organizational performance is strongly influenced by the perceived closeness between leadership and staff.

1. **Noun**: proximity (U)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The state of being close to something in space, time, or relationship; nearness.
   - In technical or academic contexts, the measurable nearness of two objects, events, or values.
   
   **Synonyms**: nearness, closeness, vicinity, adjacency, immediacy
   
   **Antonyms**: distance, remoteness, separation, farness
   
   **When to Use**: Use "proximity" when you need a formal or technical term for being close to something, especially in reports, research, planning, or safety guidelines. Often collocates with "close to" as in "in close proximity to".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal or stiff in casual conversation ("It’s close to my house" sounds more natural than "It’s in proximity to my house"). Avoid for emotional closeness in everyday speech (use "closeness" instead).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - in close proximity to, in immediate proximity to
   - physical proximity, geographic proximity, temporal proximity
   - proximity to the target, proximity to the limit, proximity sensor
   
   **Root Analysis**: proxim- (nearest, next) + -ity (state or quality)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *proximitas* (nearness, from *proximus* "nearest") → Middle French *proximité* → English "proximity".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Less natural) The hotel’s proximity to the beach is great.
   - (More natural) The hotel is really close to the beach.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The facility’s proximity to major transport hubs significantly reduces logistics costs.
   - High population density in close proximity to industrial zones raises health concerns.

1. **Noun**: verge (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The point at which something is about to happen or change; the brink of a new state or condition.
   - A boundary or edge (literal or figurative) beyond which something different begins.
   
   **Synonyms**: brink, edge, threshold, cusp, point of transition
   
   **Antonyms**: center, core, distance, safety (for danger contexts)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "verge" when something is very close to happening, especially dramatic or important changes: "on the verge of collapse", "on the verge of tears". Strongly linked with "close to" in emotional, physical, and systemic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in highly technical numeric approximations (use "margin", "tolerance"), or when the idea is not about being almost at a critical point.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - on the verge of collapse, on the verge of tears, on the verge of success
   - on the verge of discovery, on the verge of burnout
   - bring someone to the verge of, push something to the verge of
   
   **Root Analysis**: verge (edge, border) with no common productive affixes in modern English
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *vergere* (to bend, turn) → Old French *verge* (rod, staff, boundary) → English "verge" meaning edge or border, later extended to figurative "point just before something happens".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was on the verge of laughing out loud in the middle of the meeting.
   - The old bridge looks like it’s on the verge of falling down.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Noun**: threshold (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The level, point, or value at which something starts to happen or change noticeably.
   - A boundary between two states or conditions; the entrance to a new phase.
   
   **Synonyms**: limit, boundary, point of onset, tipping point, entry point
   
   **Antonyms**: plateau, interior, stability, continuation (without change)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "threshold" when talking about values or conditions that something is close to crossing—"close to the threshold" of pain, tolerance, detection, significance, or capacity. Very common in technical, medical, and statistical writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Less appropriate for simple physical distance (use "doorstep" or "entrance" literally, or "close to the door"). Avoid where no clear boundary or level exists.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - pain threshold, tolerance threshold, detection threshold
   - threshold level, threshold value, threshold for action
   - cross a threshold, close to the threshold, at the threshold of
   
   **Root Analysis**: thresh (to tread) + hold (door frame, support)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *þrescold* / *þerscold* (door-sill, place where you tread) → Modern English "threshold"; figurative sense of boundary level developed later.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My patience is getting close to its threshold.
   - The noise is right at my pain threshold—I can’t take much more.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The readings remain close to the regulatory threshold but do not yet exceed it.

1. **Noun**: margin (C)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The amount by which one thing is different from or better than another (a narrow difference); a small amount of safety or error.
   - The edge or border of something (literal or figurative).
   
   **Synonyms**: difference, buffer, leeway, allowance, edge
   
   **Antonyms**: equality, exact match, shortage, deficit
   
   **When to Use**: Use "margin" when talking about how close a result is to a limit or another value—"a narrow margin", "close to the margin of error", "win by a small margin". It highlights that things are close together but not identical.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you only mean physical nearness without comparison (use "close to" or "near"). Not ideal for emotional closeness.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - narrow margin, thin margin, small margin
   - margin of error, safety margin, profit margin
   - win by a narrow margin, close to the margin of, within the margin
   
   **Root Analysis**: margin (edge, border) with no active affixes in modern English
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin *margo* (edge, border) → Old French *marge* → English "margin".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We won the game by the tiniest margin.
   - Your score is really close to the pass mark—you missed it by a very small margin.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The results fall close to the margin of error and should be interpreted cautiously.
