1. **Linking Word**: close to (type: connector/degree marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used before numbers, limits, or states to show that something is very near but not exactly at that point.
   - *Function*: Degree/approximation connector; softens exactness while emphasizing nearness.
   
   **Synonyms**: nearly, almost, approaching, just under, in the neighborhood of
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, well below, well above (for limits)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close to" before nouns or gerunds when you want to express that a value, time, or state is very near another—"close to midnight", "close to 80%", "close to collapse". It is useful for hedging while still indicating strong proximity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when precise, exact numbers are required, or when the idea is simple spatial nearness between objects ("next to" or "beside" may be clearer). Also avoid redundancy with "almost nearly close to" combinations.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject + verb] close to [number/state]
   - [Position]: mid-sentence after main verb ("remains close to"), or after linking verb ("is close to")
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation needed
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing with "closed to" (not open to) and overusing in place of precise figures
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near in degree) + to (preposition introducing target)
   
   **Etymology**: Developed as a phrasal preposition from adjective/adverb "close" + "to" to mark strong nearness to a reference point.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We’re close to 10,000 followers now.
   - It’s getting close to midnight—we should head home.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   - Market saturation is close to the level that typically precedes consolidation.

   **Meaning**: 
   - Very close to doing or experiencing something; about to enter a particular state.
   - *Function*: Temporal/state connector emphasizing imminent change or transition.
   
   **Synonyms**: close to, about to, on the brink of, on the edge of, nearing
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, safely away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on the verge of" before a gerund or noun to highlight that something is almost happening—"on the verge of tears", "on the verge of collapse". Adds drama and emphasizes nearness to a threshold.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for routine or neutral events ("on the verge of having lunch" is usually too dramatic). Not suitable when timing is vague or distant.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + be + on the verge of + [gerund/noun]
   - [Position]: after linking verb "be"; often in main clause
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation required
   - [Common errors to avoid]: using with infinitive ("on the verge to" is incorrect), over-dramatizing minor events
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + the + verge (edge, boundary) + of
   
   **Etymology**: "Verge" from Latin *virga* (rod, border) → English "verge" (edge); phrase "on the verge of" formed to express being at the edge of a new state.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I was on the verge of laughing out loud in that super serious meeting.
   - She looks like she’s on the verge of tears.

   **Synonyms**: close to, on the verge of, on the edge of, near collapse
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, safely away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "on the brink of" to stress that a system, person, or situation is very close to a serious state—"on the brink of collapse", "on the brink of war". Stronger and more dramatic than neutral "close to".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for trivial or everyday events; it sounds overly dramatic. Not ideal in highly technical writing where neutral tone is needed.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + be + on the brink of + [noun/gerund]
   - [Position]: after linking verb; often used with negative consequences
   - [Punctuation]: straightforward; no special rules
   - [Common errors to avoid]: mixing with non-critical events, doubling drama with multiple strong intensifiers
   
   **Root Analysis**: on + the + brink (edge, steep drop) + of
   
   **Etymology**: "Brink" from Middle Dutch *brink* (edge of a field, bank) → English "brink"; phrase extended to figurative danger or opportunity.

   **Synonyms**: close to, verging on, almost, approaching
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, nowhere near, safely within limits
   
   **When to Use**: Use "bordering on" when you want to say that something is almost a particular extreme, especially negative—"bordering on rude", "bordering on illegal". It suggests nearness to a boundary.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you need neutral description without judgment; it usually carries a critical tone. Do not use for ordinary, non-extreme qualities.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + be + bordering on + [noun/adjective]
   - [Position]: after linking verb; often with negative or extreme descriptors
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation
   - [Common errors to avoid]: confusing with literal geographic "borders on" when context is abstract
   
   **Root Analysis**: border (edge, boundary) + -ing + on
   
   **Etymology**: From noun "border" (edge) → phrasal verb/preposition "border on"; extended figuratively to qualities and behaviors.

   **Antonyms**: beyond reach of, out of reach, unattainable, far from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "within reach of" to show that a goal or object is very close to being attained—"within reach of success", "within reach of the target". Strongly connected to "close to" in motivational and strategic contexts.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when something is already clearly achieved (use "has achieved" instead). Can sound clichéd if overused in marketing or motivational language.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Subject] + be + within reach of + [goal/object]
   - [Position]: after linking verb "be"; sometimes after other verbs ("come within reach of")
   - [Punctuation]: no special punctuation needed
   - [Common errors to avoid]: mixing literal and figurative meanings in the same sentence in a confusing way
   
   **Root Analysis**: within (inside the limits of) + reach (extent of grasp) + of
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *withinnan* (inside) + *rǣcan* (reach) → "within reach of" as idiomatic expression for physical and later metaphorical accessibility.
