1. **Verb**: approach
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive/Intransitive) To come close to something in distance, time, amount, or quality.
   - (Transitive) To begin to deal with or think about something in a particular way.
   
   **Synonyms**: near, come close to, draw near, move toward, approximate
   
   **Antonyms**: retreat, move away, withdraw, recede, diverge
   
   **When to Use**: Use "approach" when describing movement or development that gets close to a point—"approach the city", "approach the deadline", "approach 100%". Also common in academic and professional contexts for methods: "approach a problem".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual conversation when a simpler verb like "get close to" or "go up to" sounds more natural. Clarify context when it might be unclear whether you mean physical movement or a way of dealing with something.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - approach a place, approach the door, approach the border
   - approach a deadline, approach retirement, approach a limit
   - approach a problem, approach a task, different approaches to
   
   **Root Analysis**: ap- (to, toward) + proach (from Latin *proximare* = to come near)
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *aprochier* (to come near) → English "approach"; closely related to Latin *proximus* (nearest).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We're slowly approaching the end of the semester—hang in there.
   - As the storm approaches, we should probably head home.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The measured values approach the theoretical maximum as temperature increases.
   - This study approaches the question from a cross-disciplinary perspective.

1. **Verb**: come close (to)
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Intransitive) To be very near in distance, time, amount, or quality.
   - (Intransitive) To almost do or experience something, often without fully reaching it.
   
   **Synonyms**: nearly reach, almost achieve, get close to, approach, verge on
   
   **Antonyms**: miss by a lot, fall far short, differ greatly, be nowhere near
   
   **When to Use**: Use "come close (to)" when something is nearly but not completely achieved or reached—"come close to winning", "come close to tears", "nothing comes close to this". It naturally pairs with "close to" for near achievements and emotional states.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you mean exact achievement (use "reach", "achieve", "hit"). In very formal academic writing, more precise phrases like "approach" or "approximate" may be preferred.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - come close to winning, come close to failure, come close to collapse
   - come dangerously close to, come very close to
   - nothing comes close to, hardly anything comes close to
   
   **Root Analysis**: come (move toward) + close (near) + to (preposition introducing goal or state)
   
   **Etymology**: Old English *cuman* (come) + Middle English *close*; the phrasal pattern "come close to" developed to describe near achievement or high similarity.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We came so close to winning that game—it was decided in the last minute.
   - Nothing comes close to my grandma's cooking.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposed model comes close to reproducing the observed behavior.
   - Few existing frameworks come close to matching this level of scalability.

1. **Verb**: approximate
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive) To come close to or be almost the same as something, especially a number, amount, or quality.
   - (Transitive) To estimate or calculate something so that the result is close to the exact value but not exact.
   
   **Synonyms**: estimate, come close to, resemble, be near, be roughly equal to
   
   **Antonyms**: differ from, deviate from, be exact, specify precisely
   
   **When to Use**: Use "approximate" in formal, technical, and academic contexts when talking about values that are close to but not exactly equal to others—"approximate the result", "approximate 100%". Also used when describing rough calculations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too formal for most casual conversations (use "estimate" or "be close to"). Avoid when exact values are known and required.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - approximate the value, approximate the cost, approximate the shape
   - closely approximate, roughly approximate, numerically approximate
   - can be approximated by, approximate to
   
   **Root Analysis**: ap- (to, toward) + proxim- (nearest) + -ate (verb-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: From Late Latin *approximare* (to draw near), based on *proximus* (nearest); entered English via French with the sense of "come close to/estimate".
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Less casual) Can you approximate how much this trip will cost?
   - (More natural) Can you give me a rough idea of the cost?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The function can approximate the observed distribution with high accuracy.
   - These simplified equations approximate the behavior of the full model within acceptable error.

1. **Verb**: verge on
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Transitive/Intransitive) To be so close to a particular state, quality, or behavior that it is almost that thing.
   
   **Synonyms**: border on, come close to, be nearly, be on the edge of, approach
   
   **Antonyms**: be far from, be nowhere near, fall well short of
   
   **When to Use**: Use "verge on" when you want to say that something is very close to crossing into a state, often an extreme or negative one—"verging on rude", "verging on collapse". It emphasizes being close to a boundary.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for ordinary, neutral states; it often implies extremity or judgment. Not usual in very casual teen speech; may sound formal or literary.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - verge on the ridiculous, verge on the impossible, verge on collapse
   - verging on obsession, verging on genius, verging on chaos
   
   **Root Analysis**: verge (edge, border) + on (preposition indicating contact/target)
   
   **Etymology**: From noun "verge" (edge, boundary) plus preposition "on"; phrasal pattern developed in English to express near-transition into a state.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - His behavior was verging on crazy last night.
   - The noise level is verging on unbearable.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The company’s liquidity position is verging on critical levels.
   - The proposal is verging on unrealistic given the current budget constraints.

1. **Verb**: hover around
   **Meaning**: 
   - (Intransitive) To stay close to a particular number, level, or value without changing much.
   - (Intransitive) To remain close to someone or something, often without committing or moving decisively.
   
   **Synonyms**: stay close to, remain near, fluctuate around, linger near
   
   **Antonyms**: move far from, diverge from, drop away from, shoot up beyond
   
   **When to Use**: Use "hover around" especially with numbers, prices, or statistics that stay close to a value—"hover around 50%", "hover around the limit". Also for people staying physically or socially close without fully engaging.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal mathematical writing (prefer "remain close to", "stay near"). For physical flight (like a helicopter), "hover" alone is often enough.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - hover around 50, hover around the average, hover around the threshold
   - hover around someone, hover around the doorway
   
   **Root Analysis**: hover (remain in one place in the air or near a point) + around (adverb/preposition indicating movement in the area of)
   
   **Etymology**: "Hover" from Middle English *hoveren* (to hang in the air, linger) + "around"; the combination developed as a way to talk about values staying close to a reference point.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My energy level is just hovering around zero today.
   - The price of that stock has been hovering around the same number for weeks.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Unemployment rates continue to hover around 5%, indicating a relatively stable labor market.
   - The indicator hovers around the critical threshold without clearly crossing it.
