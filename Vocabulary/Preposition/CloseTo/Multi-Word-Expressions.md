1. **Expression**: close to home (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing something (often a comment, story, or issue) that affects someone personally or emotionally because it is very similar to their own experience.
   - Literally: physically near one’s house or local area.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (fixed phrase; article may vary: "a bit too close to home").
   
   **Synonyms**: personally relevant, hits home, strikes a chord, touches a nerve, very relatable
   
   **Antonyms**: distant, impersonal, unrelated, abstract
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close to home" when you want to say that something is emotionally or personally very near your own situation—"that joke was a bit close to home", "the documentary hit close to home". Also when something happens near where you live.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when literal physical meaning would cause confusion without context. In very formal writing, explain the idea instead of relying on the idiom unless you explicitly discuss language.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - hit close to home
   - a bit too close to home
   - strike close to home
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: "Home" represents the center of one’s personal life; "close to" signals emotional or physical nearness. Together they form a metaphor for issues that feel personally sensitive.
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near) + to + home (place where one lives)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That joke about burnout hit a little too close to home for me.
   - The news about layoffs is really close to home—my friend’s company is affected.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The case study may feel particularly close to home for practitioners working in similar environments.

1. **Expression**: too close for comfort (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing a situation where something came dangerously or uncomfortably near, making people feel uneasy.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (set phrase; small modifiers like "way" or "a little" may appear before "too").
   
   **Synonyms**: uncomfortably close, dangerously close, almost too near, borderline unsafe
   
   **Antonyms**: safely distant, comfortably far, well within the margin of safety
   
   **When to Use**: Use "too close for comfort" after a near-miss or when a risk, number, or event comes so close to a limit that people feel uneasy—"the car came too close for comfort", "numbers are too close for comfort to the limit".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid trivializing serious disasters; in highly formal reports, prefer explicit risk descriptions ("approached but did not exceed").
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - way too close for comfort
   - a little too close for comfort
   - getting too close for comfort
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Combines the idea of physical or numerical nearness ("close") with subjective feeling ("comfort"), capturing emotional reaction to high-risk proximity.
   
   **Root Analysis**: too (excessively) + close (near) + for + comfort (ease, safety)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That truck got way too close for comfort when it swerved.
   - Our budget is cutting it a bit too close for comfort this month.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Current failure rates are uncomfortably close to the contractual limit—too close for comfort from a risk-management perspective.

1. **Expression**: close call (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A narrow escape from danger or failure; a situation where something bad almost happened but did not.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (noun phrase used as set expression).
   
   **Synonyms**: near miss, narrow escape, close shave, near thing
   
   **Antonyms**: easy win, clear victory, wide margin, no contest
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close call" to talk about situations that were very close to disaster, loss, or failure—"that exam was a close call", "it was a close call on the highway".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In highly technical safety documentation, prefer "near-miss incident" or more precise terms. Be cautious using it about very serious tragedies; it can sound too light.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - that was a close call
   - really close call
   - a bit of a close call
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Close" emphasizes nearness; "call" refers to a decision or result. Together they describe outcomes that were almost the opposite.
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near) + call (decision, judgment)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That was a close call—we almost missed our flight.
   - Passing that class was a real close call for me.

1. **Expression**: close but no cigar (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to say that someone came very near to success but did not quite succeed.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (wording is stable; sometimes shortened to "close, but no cigar").
   
   **Synonyms**: almost but not quite, nearly there, just missed it, came close but failed
   
   **Antonyms**: clear success, nailed it, won by a mile
   
   **When to Use**: Use this playful idiom in informal contexts when someone’s attempt was very close to success but still a failure. Often used to soften disappointment with humor.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in serious or sensitive situations (exams, jobs, health issues) where humor may feel inappropriate. Not suitable for formal writing.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - close, but no cigar
   - almost, but no cigar
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Originating from old fairground games where cigars were prizes, the phrase captures the idea of being close to a reward but not quite winning.
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near) + but (contrast) + cigar (prize item)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - You got 59 out of 60—close but no cigar.
   - Our team was close but no cigar in the finals again this year.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: very close to, near, adjacent to, next to, in the vicinity of
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, distant from, remote from, well away from
   
   **When to Use**: Use "in close proximity to" in formal reports, technical descriptions, or legal texts to emphasize spatial nearness—"in close proximity to the boundary", "in close proximity to residents".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Too wordy for casual speech ("close to" is better). In concise formal writing, some style guides discourage the redundancy of "close proximity".
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - in immediate proximity to
   - in very close proximity to
   - in geographic proximity to
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Proximity" already means nearness; "close" adds emphasis; "in...to" forms a standard prepositional frame in formal English.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in + close (near) + proximity (nearness) + to
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - (Less natural) The hotel is in close proximity to the beach.
   - (More natural) The hotel is really close to the beach.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: close-knit community (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**:

   **Antonyms**: fragmented community, loosely connected group, distant community, isolated individuals
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close-knit community" to describe neighborhoods, teams, or groups where people know each other well and support one another. It combines the idea of being emotionally and socially "close to" each other.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for large, anonymous groups or competitive, low-trust environments. In very technical writing, a more neutral term like "cohesive" may be preferred.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - close-knit family, close-knit team, close-knit group
   - tight-knit community, tight-knit network
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Knit" evokes threads pulled tightly together; combined with "close" it emphasizes very strong social bonds.
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near, tight) + knit (join together firmly)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I grew up in a really close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
   - Our project team has become pretty close-knit over the last year.
