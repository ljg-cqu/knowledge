1. **Preposition**: close to (type: phrasal)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* At a very short distance from someone or something; almost touching; very near to a place or object.
   - *(Temporal)* Almost at a particular time or stage; near a point in time or process.
   - *(Abstract – Degree)* Almost reaching a number, level, or limit; approximating a value.
   - *(Abstract – State/Emotion)* Very nearly experiencing a state or emotion; on the verge of a feeling or condition; having a strong personal relationship with someone.
   
   **Synonyms**: near, very near to, next to (for adjacency), in the vicinity of, approaching (a number/state), on the verge of (a state)
   
   **Antonyms**: far from, distant from, remote from, nowhere near, well below (for numbers/limits)
   
   **When to Use**: Use "close to" when you want to emphasize strong proximity rather than just general nearness. It works for:
   - **Place**: describing locations that are only a short walk, drive, or reach away.
   - **Time**: talking about times that are nearly here ("close to midnight").
   - **Numbers/limits**: approximating values ("close to 100%", "close to the speed limit").
   - **States/emotions**: being nearly in a particular state ("close to tears", "close to burnout").
   It is common in both spoken and written English across casual, neutral, and professional registers.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid "close to" when you need:
   - **Exact information** instead of approximation (use precise numbers or expressions like "exactly", "precisely").
   - **Strict adjacency** such as something immediately touching or sharing a boundary (use "next to", "adjacent to", or "beside").
   - To talk about **closed** or blocked states ("closed to" has a different meaning: not open or not accepting).
   Also avoid redundant phrases like *"very close to near"*.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: close to the station, close to the border, close to the city center, close to midnight, close to the limit, close to capacity, close to 100%, close to collapse, close to tears, close to reality, close to the truth
   - **Verb + prep**: live close to, stay close to, move close to, get close to, come close to, remain close to, keep close to, grow close to (someone)
   - **Adjective + prep**: very close to, dangerously close to, uncomfortably close to, emotionally close to, physically close to
   - **Noun + prep**: distance close to, value close to, figure close to, relationship close to, position close to
   
   **Root Analysis**: close (near in space, time, or relationship; also "shut") + to (preposition indicating direction, target, or relation)
   
   **Etymology**: "Close" comes from Middle English *clos*, from Old French *clos* (shut, confined), from Latin *clausus* (closed). Over time it developed a sense of spatial and emotional nearness ("near, intimate"). "To" is from Old English *tō* (direction, relation). The combination "close to" stabilized as a phrasal preposition used for strong proximity and near states.
