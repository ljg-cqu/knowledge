1. **Original Expression**: I think this is a good idea.  
   **Context**: Neutral everyday statement giving a positive opinion about a suggestion or plan.
   
   **Core Intent**: To express a supportive, positive judgment while still framing it as a personal view.
   
   **Casual**: I think this is a good idea.  
   *Characteristics*: Simple present, first‑person I think softens the claim; friendly, everyday vocabulary (good idea).  
   *Use when*: Talking with friends, close colleagues, or peers in relaxed meetings.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I believe this is a solid idea.  
   *Characteristics*: Slightly stronger verb (believe), adjective solid suggests reliability; tone is polite, professional.  
   *Use when*: In workplace discussions, emails to colleagues, or project meetings where you want to sound supportive but still measured.
   
   **Formal**: In my view, this proposal is well founded.  
   *Characteristics*: Prepositional phrase in my view clearly marks the statement as opinion; proposal and well founded are formal, academic‑style choices.  
   *Use when*: In reports, presentations to senior stakeholders, or academic writing where explicit evaluation of ideas is required.
   
   **Humorous**: I think this might just be a genius move.  
   *Characteristics*: Playful exaggeration (genius move), might just adds lightness; tone is enthusiastic and friendly.  
   *Use when*: Among teammates with good rapport, when you want to encourage creative thinking and make people smile.  
   *Avoid when*: Discussing serious risks, sensitive topics, or decisions with major consequences.
   
   **Lively**: I really think this is a very strong idea.  
   *Characteristics*: Adverbs really and very add energy and emphasis; strong idea heightens intensity; rhythm is upbeat.  
   *Use when*: Motivating a team, building momentum around a plan, or highlighting ideas in brainstorming.
   
   **Empathetic**: I genuinely think this is a good idea, and I appreciate how much thought you’ve put into it.  
   *Characteristics*: Adverb genuinely signals sincerity; second clause explicitly recognizes the other person’s thinking effort; warm, supportive tone.  
   *Use when*: Encouraging someone who is nervous about sharing ideas, in mentoring or coaching, or when you want to recognize emotional effort.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With higher‑status listeners (managers, professors), lean toward Semi‑Formal or Formal; with peers, Casual or Lively is often fine.
   - *Social Distance*: With strangers or new professional contacts, avoid overly casual or humorous versions until rapport is established.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high‑risk decisions, choose Semi‑Formal or Formal; for low‑stakes brainstorming, Casual, Lively, or Humorous may be appropriate.
   - *Cultural Context*: In more direct cultures, stronger statements of belief are acceptable; in more indirect cultures, hedged forms (I think…, It seems to me…) feel safer.
   - *Medium*: In emails and documents, Semi‑Formal or Formal usually read better; in live conversation, Casual, Lively, and Empathetic variants feel more natural.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Overusing I think in formal writing, which can make arguments sound weak or subjective instead of evidence‑based.
   - Using humorous praise (genius move) in serious or high‑stakes contexts, which can sound unprofessional or dismissive.
   - Sounding insincere by saying I think this is a good idea while your tone, body language, or decisions suggest the opposite.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, openly stating I think is expected and shows ownership of your ideas; in others, speakers prefer more indirect expressions (It might be helpful if…, Perhaps we could consider…) to avoid sounding pushy.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Brainstorming with peers → **Appropriate Variant**: Lively (I really think this is a very strong idea.) because it adds energy and encourages further ideas.
   - **Situation 2**: Email to your manager summarizing options → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal (I believe this is a solid idea.) because it sounds confident yet professional.
   - **Situation 3**: Coaching a junior colleague who is unsure → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic (I genuinely think this is a good idea, and I appreciate how much thought you’ve put into it.) because it validates both the idea and the person.

1. **Original Expression**: I don’t think that’s a good idea.  
   **Context**: Softened disagreement with someone’s suggestion or plan.
   
   **Core Intent**: To express disagreement or concern while trying to maintain the relationship and keep the conversation constructive.
   
   **Casual**: I don’t think that’s a good idea.  
   *Characteristics*: Simple negative form of think; good idea is vague but clear; tone depends heavily on voice and context.  
   *Use when*: Talking with friends or colleagues you know well, especially when you can immediately explain your reasoning.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I’m not sure that’s the best idea.  
   *Characteristics*: I’m not sure softens the disagreement; best idea implies there may be alternatives; indirect and polite.  
   *Use when*: In meetings and email discussions where you want to express doubt without sounding harsh.
   
   **Formal**: I have some reservations about this proposal.  
   *Characteristics*: Nominalization reservations and proposal sound formal; focuses on concerns rather than directly labelling the idea as “bad.”  
   *Use when*: Presenting critical feedback in professional or academic settings, especially to higher‑status listeners.
   
   **Humorous**: I think my brain is waving a little red flag about this one.  
   *Characteristics*: Light metaphor (little red flag) reduces tension; keeps focus on your thinking rather than attacking the other person; playful tone.  
   *Use when*: With close colleagues or friends to soften disagreement and keep the mood light.  
   *Avoid when*: The situation is serious, time‑critical, or emotionally charged.
   
   **Lively**: I really don’t think that’s the right way to go.  
   *Characteristics*: really and right way to go add emphasis; energetic tone, still framed as personal view (I don’t think…).  
   *Use when*: You need to be clear and energetic about your disagreement while staying personally responsible for your opinion.
   
   **Empathetic**: I see why you’re thinking in that direction, but I’m worried this might not be the best option for us.  
   *Characteristics*: First clause acknowledges the other person’s thinking; but introduces gentle contrast; worried softens the judgment and shows care for shared outcomes.  
   *Use when*: Disagreeing with someone who may feel vulnerable, such as a junior colleague, student, or friend sharing a personal plan.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With superiors, prefer Semi‑Formal or Formal to show respect; with peers and reports, Casual, Lively, or Empathetic may build openness.
   - *Social Distance*: With clients or new contacts, avoid blunt Casual forms; use Semi‑Formal or Formal to protect the relationship.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high‑risk decisions, choose clearer, more explicit variants (Semi‑Formal, Formal, Lively); for small issues, Casual or Humorous can be enough.
   - *Cultural Context*: In more direct cultures, clear disagreement is expected; in more indirect cultures, speakers often layer extra hedging (I’m a bit concerned…, Perhaps we should reconsider…).
   - *Medium*: In writing, blunt negatives can feel harsher; Semi‑Formal and Formal versions often read more professional in email and documents.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying I don’t think that’s a good idea with a sharp tone, which can sound like a personal attack rather than thoughtful disagreement.
   - Jumping straight to strong Formal criticism (This is unacceptable.) without first acknowledging the other person’s thinking.
   - Using only vague disagreement (I’m not sure…) without explaining the reasoning, which can block shared problem‑solving.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, open disagreement is normal in meetings; in others, people prefer to phrase doubts very gently or express them in private. Adjust how directly you say I don’t think that’s a good idea based on local norms.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Daily stand‑up with a peer → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi‑Formal (I’m not sure that’s the best idea.) because it signals doubt but invites further discussion.
   - **Situation 2**: Writing feedback on a proposal from a senior manager → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal (I have some reservations about this proposal.) because it respects hierarchy while clearly flagging concerns.
   - **Situation 3**: Coaching a junior colleague → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic (I see why you’re thinking in that direction, but I’m worried this might not be the best option for us.) because it validates their thinking while gently redirecting it.
