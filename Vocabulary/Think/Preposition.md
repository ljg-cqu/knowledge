1. **Preposition**: about (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Rare in modern literal spatial use; historically “around,” now mostly replaced by around.
   - *(Temporal)* Occasionally “around a time” in informal speech (about midnight), but this is numerical approximation rather than true temporal relation.
   - *(Abstract)* Concerning, regarding, or relating to a topic, especially what someone thinks, feels, or talks.
   
   **Synonyms**: regarding (formal), concerning (formal), on (in some contexts), over (in some contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: N/A as a direct preposition, but away from or off topic contrast with about.
   
   **When to Use**: Linking mental verbs (think, know, worry, dream, talk) to their topic: think about a problem, talk about ideas; also with questions about feelings and opinions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing where regarding or concerning fits better; do not use when on is needed for fixed expressions (a book on physics, a lecture on logic) unless the style is informal.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: about something, about the future, about the decision
   - **Verb + prep**: think about, talk about, worry about, learn about
   - **Adjective + prep**: sure about, uncertain about, curious about
   - **Noun + prep**: thoughts about, questions about, ideas about
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English root; historically related to “on the outside, around.”
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *abutan* / *onbutan* (around, on the outside); over time shifted from spatial “around” to abstract “concerning,” especially with mental and speech verbs.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’ve been thinking a lot about your suggestion.
   - How do you feel about changing the plan?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were asked about their previous experience with critical‑thinking courses.
   - The report raises important questions about how people form judgments.

1. **Preposition**: of (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Indicates belonging to or coming from something (a piece of the whole) but less central for thinking.
   - *(Temporal)* Rare; usually handled by other prepositions.
   - *(Abstract)* Expresses relationships of possession, origin, content, or association, especially in mental phrases (a way of thinking, fear of failure, memory of events).
   
   **Synonyms**: belonging to, from, about (in some senses), regarding (in some senses)
   
   **Antonyms**: free from (for absence of quality), independent of
   
   **When to Use**: In fixed mental and emotional combinations: idea of, fear of, way of thinking, perception of, awareness of; also after adjectives and nouns that describe mental states.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not replace about with of after mental verbs (✗ think of it a lot when you mean “consider it often” is different from ✓ think about it a lot); avoid when from or about is the standard choice.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: of the mind, of great importance, of interest
   - **Verb + prep**: think of (first recall), dream of, approve of, disapprove of
   - **Adjective + prep**: aware of, afraid of, capable of, sure of
   - **Noun + prep**: idea of, sense of, memory of, understanding of
   
   **Root Analysis**: Very old Germanic preposition; no clear prefix/suffix.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *of* / *æf* (away from, out of); the modern “belonging to / associated with” use developed gradually, now extremely common in abstract thinking expressions.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like the idea of taking a day just to think things through.
   - She has a clear understanding of how people think under pressure.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The concept of bounded rationality challenges classical models of decision‑making.
   - Students’ perception of their own thinking skills influenced their performance.

1. **Preposition**: over (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* Above and across something (jump over the fence).
   - *(Temporal)* During a period of time (over the weekend).
   - *(Abstract)* Concerning or regarding a matter, especially in conflicts or careful thinking (argue over, think over a decision).
   
   **Synonyms**: about (in informal speech), regarding, concerning, on (in some contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: ignoring, unconcerned with (conceptual opposites rather than prepositional)
   
   **When to Use**: With verbs of discussion or thought (argue over, debate over, worry over) and phrasal verb *think over* (meaning to consider carefully).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when standard English uses about instead (think about) or when above is purely spatial; do not confuse with “finished” in *it’s over* (adverb/adjective, not preposition).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: over the question, over the issue, over the decision
   - **Verb + prep**: think over, argue over, fight over, worry over
   - **Adjective + prep**: upset over, anxious over (mainly AmE)
   - **Noun + prep**: dispute over, disagreement over, debate over
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old Germanic root; related to *above* and “upper” ideas.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *ofer* (above, across); abstract uses with argument and thinking developed as metaphors for being “on top of” or “across” an issue.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I want to think it over before I say yes.
   - They argued for hours over what the data really meant.

   **Synonyms**: by means of, via, using, as a result of
   
   **Antonyms**: without (when contrasting “through X” vs. “without X”)
   
   **When to Use**: With verbs describing mental processes and learning: think through, work through, learn through doing, understand through examples.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when from, by, or during is the normal choice; do not confuse with the adverb meaning “finished” (we’re through).
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: through reflection, through practice, through discussion
   - **Verb + prep**: think through, work through, reason through, learn through
   - **Adjective + prep**: clear through (less common), open to learning through
   - **Noun + prep**: learning through experience, insight through analysis
   
   **Root Analysis**: Germanic root; related to “door” and “throughout” in older forms.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from *þurh* (through, across); abstract “by means of” meaning extended naturally to mental processes.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I need to think this through before I reply.
   - We worked through the problem step by step.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* To the inside of something (go into the room).
   - *(Temporal)* Moving from one state or period to another (late into the night).
   - *(Abstract)* Toward a deeper level of understanding or detail (look into a question, dig into a problem, break something into parts in thought).
   
   **Synonyms**: inside (spatial), toward, regarding (in some abstract uses), concerning (in some idioms)
   
   **Antonyms**: out of (spatial), away from, superficial to (conceptual opposite for depth)
   
   **When to Use**: With verbs of investigation and analysis—look into, dig into, go deeper into a topic—when you want to highlight entering more detailed thinking.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid after verbs that normally take about or on (talk about, focus on); do not overuse in formal writing where examine or analyze may be clearer.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: into detail, into depth, into the reasons
   - **Verb + prep**: look into, dig into, inquire into, break into parts (in thought)
   - **Adjective + prep**: curious into (rare; usually curious about)
   - **Noun + prep**: inquiry into, investigation into, analysis into (BrE, though many writers prefer analysis of)
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (inside) + to (toward) fused into a single compound preposition.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → combination of *in* + *to*; later written as one word; abstract uses with investigation and analysis grew as “going inside” was mapped to “going deeper in thought.”
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’ll look into it and let you know what I find.
   - Let’s dig into why people think this feature is confusing.
