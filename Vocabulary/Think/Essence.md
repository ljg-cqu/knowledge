1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Think*, capture the small set of ideas that define thinking as a practical skill: how people use their minds to make sense of situations, form judgments, and create options.
   - **Scope**: Covers everyday and professional thinking processes (noticing, interpreting, reasoning, reflecting, and generating ideas). Excludes detailed neuroscience, clinical psychology, or domain-specific methods (e.g., formal logic systems, therapy schools, or specific creativity techniques).
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What does it actually mean to "think" in practice, beyond just having thoughts pass through your mind?
     - Which few types and patterns of thinking matter most for making better decisions and learning faster?
     - How does thinking go wrong (biases, noise, overload), and how can you correct or design around that?
     - How can you deliberately design your environment, habits, and tools to support clearer, more effective thinking?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Orientation**: Understanding / Deciding / Creating.
     - **Depth & Speed**: Fast / intuitive vs slow / deliberate.
     - **Time Horizon**: Immediate moves / near-term cycles / long-term direction.
     - **Social Mode**: Solo vs shared (dialogue, writing, tools, groups).
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Thinking*: Active mental work to make sense of information, reach judgments, or imagine possibilities.
     - *Attention*: Where your limited mental energy is directed at a given moment.
     - *Mental Model*: A structured internal representation of how part of the world works.
     - *Reasoning*: Using evidence and logic to move from premises to conclusions.
     - *Reflection*: Turning experience or information back over in your mind to extract learning or meaning.
     - *Metacognition*: Noticing and guiding your own thinking processes.
     - *Cognitive Bias*: A systematic pattern where thinking departs from accuracy or good judgment.

1. Q: Essence card – Thinking as deliberate sense-making
   A:
   - **Label**: Thinking as deliberate sense-making
   - **Core Idea**: Thinking is not just having passing thoughts; it is the deliberate act of selecting, organizing, and connecting information so that a situation starts to make structured sense.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without deliberate sense-making, you stay in vague confusion: decisions feel random, explanations stay fuzzy, and you cannot reliably improve your responses to similar situations.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Orientation = Understanding; Depth & Speed = slow / deliberate; Social Mode = solo.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - attention
     - mental model

1. Q: Essence card – Fast vs slow thinking modes
   A:
   - **Label**: Fast vs slow thinking modes
   - **Core Idea**: Human thinking runs in two broad modes: fast, intuitive pattern-matching that reacts quickly, and slower, effortful reasoning that checks assumptions, compares options, and re-structures problems.
   - **Why It Matters**: Knowing which mode you are in lets you decide when to trust intuition and when to slow down; many serious mistakes come from using fast thinking where slow thinking is needed (or over-analyzing when a quick pattern is enough).
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Depth & Speed = fast vs slow; Time Horizon = immediate moves vs near-term plans.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - intuition
     - deliberate reasoning

1. Q: Essence card – Thinking links perception to decision
   A:
   - **Label**: Thinking links perception to decision
   - **Core Idea**: Thinking sits between what you notice and what you do: it filters raw inputs, frames the situation, evaluates trade-offs, and chooses a direction of action.
   - **Why It Matters**: Improving thinking is often the highest-leverage way to improve decisions and outcomes, because the same facts can lead to very different actions depending on how they are framed and compared in your mind.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Orientation = Deciding; Time Horizon = near-term cycles / long-term direction.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - decision
     - trade-off

1. Q: Essence card – Thinking quality depends on inputs and constraints
   A:
   - **Label**: Thinking quality depends on inputs and constraints
   - **Core Idea**: The quality of your thinking is constrained by what you pay attention to (signals vs noise), how much time and energy you have, and how your environment nudges or fragments your focus.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many "thinking" problems are really input or constraint problems—if you change the information you see, reduce interruptions, or adjust time boxes, your thinking often improves without new techniques.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Orientation = Understanding & Deciding; Time Horizon = immediate moves; Social Mode = solo or shared, shaped by environment.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - attention
     - information diet

1. Q: Essence card – Metacognition steers how you think
   A:
   - **Label**: Metacognition steers how you think
   - **Core Idea**: Metacognition is the ability to notice your own thinking patterns (e.g., "I am looping," "I am defending a belief") and to choose a different strategy, pace, or tool when the current one is not working.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without metacognition, you stay locked inside whatever mode you started in; with it, you can switch from ruminating to analyzing, from overthinking to deciding, or from solo thinking to seeking outside perspectives.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Orientation = Understanding & Improving thinking; Time Horizon = long-term direction; Social Mode = solo, sometimes supported by tools or feedback.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - metacognition
     - reflection
     - checklist

1. Q: Essence card – Thinking with others externalizes thought
   A:
   - **Label**: Thinking with others externalizes thought
   - **Core Idea**: Talking, writing, sketching, or debating with others turns private thoughts into shared artifacts that can be challenged, refined, and recombined.
   - **Why It Matters**: Externalizing thinking reduces blind spots and stuckness: other minds (or even a blank page) reveal gaps, contradictions, and new options that solo thinking often misses.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Orientation = Creating & Refining ideas; Social Mode = shared (dialogue, whiteboards, documents).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - externalization
     - feedback
