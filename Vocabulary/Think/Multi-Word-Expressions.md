1. **Expression**: think about (something) (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To direct your mind toward a subject, person, or problem, considering it for a short or long time.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (other verbs can be used, but *think about* is the default everyday choice for mental focus).
   
   **Synonyms**: consider something, reflect on something, ponder something, mull something over, give something thought
   
   **Antonyms**: ignore something, avoid thinking about something, push something out of your mind, not think about something
   
   **When to Use**: In almost any context—casual, professional, or academic—when you talk about directing attention or mental effort toward an issue.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing where more precise verbs (analyze, evaluate, examine) are appropriate; do not use when you mean remember (use *think back to* or *remember*).
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - think about it
   - think carefully about
   - think seriously about
   - really think about
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: *think* is the core mental‑activity verb in English, and *about* is the default preposition for “regarding a topic,” so they naturally co‑occur at very high frequency.
   
   **Root Analysis**: think (mental activity) + about (regarding a topic).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I need to think about it before I decide.
   - Have you thought about what you want to do next year?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants were asked to think about a recent difficult decision before answering the survey.
   - Leaders must think carefully about the long‑term effects of short‑term actions.

1. **Expression**: think through (something) (type: collocation/phrasal pattern)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To consider all the parts and possible consequences of a plan, problem, or decision in a careful, step‑by‑step way.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (other verbs can combine with *through*, but *think through* is a common pattern for systematic mental processing).
   
   **Synonyms**: work through, reason through, analyze in detail, examine carefully, plan out
   
   **Antonyms**: rush into, act without thinking, gloss over, skim
   
   **When to Use**: In problem‑solving, planning, and decision‑making contexts when you want to highlight structured, thorough thinking.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for very quick or trivial choices; do not use when only brief consideration is possible or expected.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - think something through
   - think through the options
   - think it through first
   - fully think through
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: *through* suggests moving from one end of something to the other; paired with *think*, it metaphorically frames careful reasoning as traveling through all parts of a situation.
   
   **Root Analysis**: think (mental activity) + through (from one end to the other).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let’s think this through before we change the whole plan.
   - I wish I’d thought it through instead of saying yes so quickly.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Teams were encouraged to think through the implications of each alternative.
   - Effective decision‑making requires time to think through potential risks and trade‑offs.

1. **Expression**: make up your mind (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To decide what you think or what you are going to do after considering different options.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (word order and wording are quite fixed; pronoun can change: my/your/her mind).
   
   **Synonyms**: decide, reach a decision, come to a conclusion, settle on something
   
   **Antonyms**: hesitate, remain undecided, sit on the fence, keep changing your mind
   
   **When to Use**: In everyday and informal professional speech when someone needs to choose between options or stop delaying a decision.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing (use *reach a decision* instead); do not use when decision‑making is shared or collective rather than individual.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - make up my/your/her/their mind
   - can’t make up my mind
   - finally made up his mind
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The mind is treated as something you can “make up” or arrange; once it is “made up,” your thinking is settled.
   
   **Root Analysis**: make up (phrasal verb: create, form) + mind (seat of thought).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Hurry up and make up your mind—we don’t have all day.
   - I still haven’t made up my mind about the job offer.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

1. **Expression**: change your mind (type: collocation/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**:

   **Synonyms**: reconsider, revise your opinion, reverse your decision, think again
   
   **Antonyms**: stick to your decision, hold firm, keep the same view
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that thinking is flexible and can be updated; frequent in everyday life, coaching, and growth‑mindset discussions.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid implying weakness when someone changes their mind responsibly in response to evidence; in very formal writing, use *revise one’s view* or *update one’s belief*.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - change my/your/her mind
   - completely change your mind
   - suddenly change his mind
   - change your mind about something
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: The mind is conceptualized as a state that can shift; *change* naturally combines with nouns for states and positions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: change (alter) + mind (seat of thought).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - It’s okay to change your mind when you learn something new.
   - I changed my mind after I heard everyone’s arguments.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The experiment examined how often people change their minds when confronted with strong counter‑evidence.

1. **Expression**: think outside the box (type: idiom/fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To think in an original or creative way, not limited by traditional ideas or usual rules.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (article and basic wording are stable; occasionally *out of the box* is used with the same meaning).
   
   **Synonyms**: think creatively, break out of conventional thinking, challenge assumptions, think differently
   
   **Antonyms**: think conventionally, stay inside the box, follow standard thinking, think in a rigid way
   
   **When to Use**: In work, design, and innovation contexts when encouraging or praising unconventional ideas.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing, where more neutral phrases like *use creative approaches* are better; the phrase can feel cliché if overused.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - think outside the box
   - get outside the box
   - out‑of‑the‑box thinking
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: The “box” symbolizes conventional boundaries; thinking “outside” it is an easy mental picture for creative thinking.
   
   **Root Analysis**: think (use the mind) + outside (beyond) + the box (metaphor for limits or norms).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The team really needs to think outside the box on this problem.
   - Her idea was totally outside the box, but it worked.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Innovation workshops aim to encourage participants to think outside the box.

1. **Expression**: weigh the pros and cons (type: fixed phrase)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To think carefully about the advantages and disadvantages of something before deciding.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (the plural phrase *pros and cons* is highly conventional; *weigh* is the usual verb in this idiom).
   
   **Synonyms**: evaluate benefits and risks, consider upsides and downsides, balance advantages and disadvantages
   
   **Antonyms**: decide impulsively, ignore the consequences, focus only on benefits or only on risks
   
   **When to Use**: When discussing deliberate, balanced thinking about decisions in everyday life, coaching, counseling, and business.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing (use *assess costs and benefits*); do not use when the choice is trivial.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - weigh up the pros and cons (BrE)
   - carefully weigh the pros and cons
   - list the pros and cons
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For fixed phrases*: *Weigh* fits the metaphor of putting pros and cons on a mental scale; *pros and cons* (Latin “for and against”) is a long‑established pair.
   
   **Root Analysis**: weigh (measure weight) + pros (for) + cons (against).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I need to weigh the pros and cons before I accept the offer.
   - Let’s write down the pros and cons so we can see them clearly.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Decision‑makers are expected to weigh the pros and cons of each policy option.

1. **Expression**: lose your train of thought (type: idiom)
   **Meaning**:

   - *Fixedness*: strong (the phrase *train of thought* is a stable metaphor; *lose* is the typical verb used).
   
   **Synonyms**: forget what you were saying, get distracted, blank out, lose focus
   
   **Antonyms**: stay focused, maintain your train of thought, follow the argument clearly
   
   **When to Use**: Describing interruptions to thinking in everyday conversation or presentations; often used when apologizing for a pause or confusion.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal academic writing; use *lose focus* or *be interrupted* instead.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - lose my/your/her train of thought
   - completely lose my train of thought
   - get back to my train of thought
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Thinking is compared to a train moving along a track; when you “lose” the train, you can’t follow the line of thought anymore.
   
   **Root Analysis**: lose (no longer have) + train (series, line) + of thought (connected ideas).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Sorry, I just lost my train of thought for a second.
   - The noise made me lose my train of thought.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Frequent interruptions can cause speakers to lose their train of thought.

   - *Fixedness*: strong (usually appears as *food for thought* with little variation).
   
   **Synonyms**: something to think about, material for reflection, a thought‑provoking idea
   
   **Antonyms**: trivial remark, empty talk, mental junk food (playful opposite)
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to say that a comment, question, or piece of information is interesting and worth deeper reflection; natural in semi‑formal and informal speech and writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overuse in formal papers; instead, say that something “raises important questions” or “suggests further avenues for thought.”
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - give you some food for thought
   - a bit of food for thought
   - plenty of food for thought
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For idioms*: Ideas are compared to food that feeds the mind; “food for thought” is an easy metaphor for something mentally nourishing.
   
   **Root Analysis**: food (what we eat) + for (intended for) + thought (mental activity).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That documentary gave me a lot of food for thought.
   - Her question was real food for thought for the whole team.
