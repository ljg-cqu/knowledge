# Source - Formality Variants

1. **Original Expression**: Where did you get this information?  
   **Context**: Asking someone to reveal or clarify the source of a claim, number, or document
   
   **Core Intent**: To request the origin of information so its reliability can be evaluated
   
   **Casual**: Where did you get this from?  
   *Characteristics*: Contraction possible ("Whered"), colloquial "get," direct question  
   *Use when*: Talking with friends, teammates, or peers in relaxed settings
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Where did you get this information?  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral verb choices, complete question form, polite but straightforward  
   *Use when*: Work meetings, email threads, internal documents where you want clarity without sounding aggressive
   
   **Formal**: Could you indicate the source of this information?  
   *Characteristics*: Modal verb ("could"), nominalization ("source"), indirect request, professional tone  
   *Use when*: Formal emails, reports, reviews, cross-team communication, situations with power distance
   
   **Humorous**: Okay, whos your mysterious source on this one?  
   *Characteristics*: Light teasing, playful framing ("mysterious source"), still asks for origin  
   *Use when*: Good rapport, informal chats, trying to keep the mood light while still checking evidence  
   *Avoid when*: With strangers, in tense discussions, or when stakes are high
   
   **Lively**: Id love to see where this comes from—can you show me the original?  
   *Characteristics*: Enthusiastic framing ("Id love to"), positive curiosity, explicit interest in the original source  
   *Use when*: Collaborative meetings, research discussions, workshops, knowledge-sharing sessions
   
   **Empathetic**: This is really interesting; to understand it better, could you share where its coming from?  
   *Characteristics*: Validates the other person ("really interesting"), frames request as shared understanding, softens potential challenge  
   *Use when*: Giving feedback, mentoring, cross-cultural settings, or with more junior colleagues
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With senior people, prefer Semi-Formal or Formal; with peers, Casual or Lively is usually fine.
   - *Social Distance*: The less you know someone, the more helpful it is to soften with Empathetic or Semi-Formal variants.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high-stakes decisions, lean toward Formal; for brainstorming, Casual or Lively works.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some contexts see direct "Where did you get this?" as too blunt—add softeners like "could you" or "Id love to know."
   - *Medium*: Written communication tends to prefer Semi-Formal or Formal; spoken conversations can be more Casual or Lively.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Sounding accusatory ("Where on earth did you get this?") when you actually want constructive clarification.
   - Using very formal phrasing in fast-moving chats, which may feel stiff or slow the conversation.
   - Avoiding the question entirely and then silently distrusting the information.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some cultures, questioning a source can feel like questioning the person. Framing the request as shared curiosity (Empathetic variant) helps maintain face.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Peer code review → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("Where did you get this assumption about the data?")
   - **Situation 2**: Email to external partner → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("Could you indicate the source of these figures?")
   - **Situation 3**: 1:1 with direct report → **Appropriate Variant**: Empathetic ("This looks promising—can you show me where its coming from?")

1. **Original Expression**: I dont have a solid source for this yet.  
   **Context**: Admitting that a claim is currently unsupported or only loosely sourced
   
   **Core Intent**: To be transparent about the current lack of strong evidence
   
   **Casual**: I dont really have a source for this yet.  
   *Characteristics*: Contraction ("dont"), hedging adverb ("really"), conversational tone  
   *Use when*: Brainstorming, informal chats, early-stage idea discussions
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I dont have a strong source for this yet—this is more of a hypothesis.  
   *Characteristics*: Distinguishes between evidence and hypothesis, clear caveat, neutral tone  
   *Use when*: Team discussions, internal documents, early-stage proposals
   
   **Formal**: At this stage, this should be treated as a hypothesis rather than a conclusion, as we do not yet have robust sources.  
   *Characteristics*: Impersonal framing ("this should be treated"), precise labels ("hypothesis," "conclusion"), emphasis on evidence  
   *Use when*: Draft reports, research proposals, presentations to stakeholders
   
   **Humorous**: This is currently powered more by vibes than by sources—handle with care.  
   *Characteristics*: Self-deprecating humor, playful "vibes" vs. evidence contrast  
   *Use when*: With trusted colleagues, in low-stakes exploration, to signal openness to correction  
   *Avoid when*: With senior stakeholders expecting rigor
   
   **Lively**: Think of this as an early signal, not a finished conclusion—we still need to back it up with solid sources.  
   *Characteristics*: Energetic framing ("early signal"), forward-looking ("still need to"), action-oriented  
   *Use when*: Strategy workshops, roadmap discussions, exploratory reviews
   
   **Empathetic**: I want to share this idea, but to be fair, I dont have strong sources for it yet—its more of a starting point for us to explore.  
   *Characteristics*: Honest self-positioning, emphasizes shared exploration, reduces pressure to defend the claim  
   *Use when*: With collaborators, cross-functional partners, or mentees
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With leaders, Semi-Formal or Formal helps show respect for evidence; with peers, Casual or Lively is often fine.
   - *Social Distance*: The newer the relationship, the clearer you should be about "hypothesis" vs "fact."
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Higher stakes call for more precise language around evidence status.
   - *Medium*: Written updates benefit from Semi-Formal or Formal; spoken brainstorming can lean Casual or Humorous.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Presenting unsourced ideas as if they were evidence.
   - Hiding uncertainty instead of labeling it clearly.
   - Over-apologizing for not having sources yet when exploration is expected.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some working cultures, explicitly labeling ideas as provisional builds trust; in others, people may expect stronger claims—clarify norms with your team.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Early research sync → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("I dont have a strong source for this yet—this is mostly pattern-sensing.")
   - **Situation 2**: Stakeholder email → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("This should be treated as directional until we validate it against primary sources.")
   - **Situation 3**: Casual whiteboard session → **Appropriate Variant**: Humorous ("This is more vibes than data right now.")

1. **Original Expression**: Please cite your sources.  
   **Context**: Asking someone to provide references or links for the information they use
   
   **Core Intent**: To require transparency and traceability for claims or data
   
   **Casual**: Got a source for this?  
   *Characteristics*: Very short, uses internet-slang style, often written as just "source?"  
   *Use when*: Chat, social media, internal informal channels, among peers
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Please cite your sources for these figures.  
   *Characteristics*: Polite "please," specific object ("these figures"), clear expectation  
   *Use when*: Team docs, comment threads, internal reviews, code comments
   
   **Formal**: For clarity and reproducibility, please cite all sources used to derive these results.  
   *Characteristics*: Emphasizes reproducibility, comprehensive scope ("all sources"), formal register  
   *Use when*: Academic writing, formal reviews, documentation standards, policy work
   
   **Humorous**: Amazing claim—now lets see the receipts.  
   *Characteristics*: Playful metaphor ("receipts"), internet idiom, friendly challenge  
   *Use when*: With close colleagues, in low-stakes discussions, to nudge sourcing without sounding harsh  
   *Avoid when*: With unfamiliar or sensitive audiences
   
   **Lively**: This is great—could you drop in the links or papers youre pulling from so others can dig deeper?  
   *Characteristics*: Positive opening ("This is great"), collaborative tone, frames citation as help to others  
   *Use when*: Collaborative docs, learning communities, workshops, mentoring contexts
   
   **Empathetic**: I know it takes extra effort, but citing your sources here will really help others trust and build on your work.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges effort, appeals to shared goals (trust, reuse), gentle encouragement  
   *Use when*: Coaching, feedback to juniors, setting team norms
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With juniors, Lively or Empathetic nudges work well; with seniors, Semi-Formal or Formal are safer.
   - *Social Distance*: Short "source?" can feel rude with strangers; use fuller forms when in doubt.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For serious reports, Formal variants make the standard explicit.
   - *Medium*: Chat allows Casual; official documents should use Semi-Formal or Formal.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Writing only "source?" in serious contexts, which can feel dismissive.
   - Assuming everyone shares the same citation norms.
   - Forgetting to make it clear *which* statements need sources.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In some environments, requesting sources is standard and expected; in others, it may feel confrontational. Framing it as support for the team or readers can soften the request.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Pull request review → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("Could you cite the data source for this threshold?")
   - **Situation 2**: Journal peer review → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("Please provide citations to support these background claims.")
   - **Situation 3**: Team Slack channel → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual/Lively ("Love this chart—got a source link?")
