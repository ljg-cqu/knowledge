1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of Source vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Source*, capture the few ideas and words people need to talk clearly about where information, data, and claims come from, how they travel through systems, and how trustworthy they are for decisions.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on information and data sources in study, research, journalism, analysis, product work, and everyday fact-checking. Covers origin (where something begins), type of source (people, documents, datasets, outlets), and core quality attributes (reliability, bias, independence, traceability, verifiability). Excludes detailed sensor technology, energy or water “sources,” and deep domain theory in statistics or epistemology.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - When you see a claim, document, or dataset, how do you describe *where it comes from* in precise language?
     - How do you distinguish primary, secondary, and derivative sources so you know how close you are to the original evidence?
     - How do you talk about whether a source is reliable, credible, biased, independent, or conflicted?
     - How do you describe and question the provenance and traceability of data, models, or stories as they move through repositories and outlets?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Type of source**: person / document / dataset / system / media outlet.
     - **Distance from event**: primary / secondary / tertiary / derivative.
     - **Quality attributes**: reliability, credibility, bias, independence, traceability, verifiability.
     - **Visibility & access**: named vs anonymous; public vs confidential; open repository vs private archive.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Source*: The person, document, dataset, or system from which information or data originates.
     - *Primary source*: First-hand evidence such as original documents, raw data, or direct observation.
     - *Secondary source*: Work that summarizes or interprets primary sources (for example, textbooks, review articles, news write-ups).
     - *Provenance*: The documented history of where information or data came from and how it has been handled.
     - *Citation*: A formal reference that points to a specific source.
     - *Dataset*: A structured collection of data gathered from one or more sources.
     - *Outlet*: A media or publishing channel that distributes information from underlying sources.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Evidence & argumentation; Information literacy; Research methods; Data management.
     - **Siblings**: Fact-checking; Academic writing; Journalism; Data pipelines; Statistics basics.
     - **Downstream**: Citation practice; Data lineage & governance; Model cards; Risk and bias analysis; News and trend tracking.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Roles, Action, Quantified].
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: Students, researchers, analysts, journalists, editors, policy-makers, product managers, engineers.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.

1. Q: Essence card – Source as origin and channel of information
   A:
   - **Label**: Source as origin and channel of information
   - **Core Idea**: A source is not only a place or document; it is the origin *and path* by which information, data, or stories reach you, shaping what you see and how you interpret it.
   - **Why It Matters**: If you cannot name or describe the source behind a claim, you cannot meaningfully judge, compare, or combine information. Decisions then rest on vague “they say” instead of traceable origins.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Type of source = person / document / dataset / system / outlet; Distance from event = varies from direct witness to many steps away.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - source
     - origin
     - outlet

1. Q: Essence card – Primary vs secondary vs derivative sources
   A:
   - **Label**: Primary vs secondary vs derivative sources
   - **Core Idea**: The primary/secondary distinction tells you how close a source is to the original event or data: primary gives first-hand evidence; secondary interprets it; later summaries, posts, and slides are derivative layers built on top.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many misunderstandings come from mistaking secondary or tertiary summaries for originals. Clear vocabulary around distance from the event helps you choose which layer to consult or cite for a given task.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Distance from event = primary / secondary / derivative; Type of source = document, dataset, outlet.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - primary source
     - secondary source
     - review article

1. Q: Essence card – Reliability, credibility, and bias as quality axes
   A:
   - **Label**: Reliability, credibility, and bias as quality axes
   - **Core Idea**: Words like reliable, credible, biased, independent give you a compact set of axes to judge whether a source can support decisions: how consistent it is, how well-supported its claims are, and how its interests might tilt what it reports.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without this small quality vocabulary, you fall back on vague feelings (“seems okay”) instead of explicit evaluation criteria, which makes it hard to compare sources or explain why one should carry more weight.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Quality attributes = reliability / credibility / bias / independence; Visibility & access = on-the-record vs anonymous.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - reliable
     - credible
     - biased
     - independent

1. Q: Essence card – Provenance, traceability, and verifiability
   A:
   - **Label**: Provenance, traceability, and verifiability
   - **Core Idea**: Provenance, traceable, and verifiable describe whether you can follow information or data back through a documented chain of sources and checks, and whether others could independently confirm it.
   - **Why It Matters**: In research, analytics, and governance, disputes often hinge not on the final number but on where it came from. Provenance terms let you talk precisely about audit trails, reproducibility, and whether a claim can be checked.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Quality attributes = traceability / verifiability; Type of source = datasets, repositories, documents.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - provenance
     - traceable
     - verifiable

1. Q: Essence card – Anonymous, leaked, and confidential sources
   A:
   - **Label**: Anonymous, leaked, and confidential sources
   - **Core Idea**: Anonymous sources, leaks, and confidential documents highlight a trade-off: you may gain access to information that would otherwise stay hidden, but at the cost of extra verification work and higher risk of distortion.
   - **Why It Matters**: Journalism, investigations, and internal reporting often depend on such sources. Having precise words for them helps you discuss risk, ethics, and verification steps instead of treating all “tips” as equal.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Visibility & access = named vs anonymous, public vs confidential; Risk level = legal/ethical/safety concerns.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - anonymous source
     - leak
     - confidential

1. Q: Essence card – Repositories and datasets as structured aggregates of sources
   A:
   - **Label**: Repositories and datasets as structured aggregates of sources
   - **Core Idea**: Repositories and datasets are organized collections that bundle many underlying sources into a single object you can query, share, or cite, while still needing documentation of where their contents came from.
   - **Why It Matters**: In modern work you rarely touch raw primary sources directly; you work through repositories, portals, and curated datasets. Vocabulary for these aggregates helps you talk about how “upstream” your view really is and what documentation you should demand.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Type of source = dataset / repository / outlet; Quality attributes = provenance & documentation quality.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - dataset
     - repository
     - data source
