   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: According to [source], [statement]
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence parenthetical
   - **Punctuation**: comma after introductory phrase
   
   **Root Analysis**: according (in agreement with) + to.
   
   **Etymology**: From Old French *acorder* (to agree); widely used for source attribution.

1. **Linking Word**: therefore (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a logical conclusion drawn from evidence or sources just mentioned.
   - *Function*: consequence/result based on prior information.
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, thus, as a result, hence

   **Etymology**: In English since Middle English; core logical connector in academic writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Most independent sources agree; therefore, I trust this number.
   - The dataset only covers one region; therefore, we shouldnt generalize too much.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The primary sources are consistent across years; therefore, we treat the series as reliable.
   - No verifiable sources support the claim; therefore, it is excluded from the main analysis.

1. **Linking Word**: however (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a contrast, especially between what sources say or between evidence and expectations.
   - *Function*: contrast/opposition

   **When to Use**: After citing one source when you need to present contradictory evidence or limitations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: For mild, local contrast inside a single clause (use "although" or "while").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [Statement]. However, [contrasting statement].
   - **Position**: sentence-initial or mid-sentence after a semicolon
   - **Punctuation**: comma after "However"; semicolon often before mid-sentence use
   
   **Root Analysis**: how + ever (originally "in whatever way").
   
   **Etymology**: Meaning shifted to adversative connector in formal writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The press release sounds confident. However, the underlying data are missing.
   - Several articles repeat the same claim; however, none link to a primary source.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Official statistics suggest a decline. However, independent surveys paint a more mixed picture.
   - The leaked memo appears authentic; however, its date conflicts with other documented sources.

1. **Linking Word**: for example (type: connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a specific instance that illustrates a more general statement based on sources.
   - *Function*: exemplification
   
   **Synonyms**: for instance, such as, to illustrate, e.g.
   
   **Antonyms**: in general, overall, broadly speaking
   
   **When to Use**: After summarizing patterns seen across sources when you want to highlight a concrete case.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When the example is not representative, or when you are stating a definition rather than an illustration.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Clause structure**: [General claim]. For example, [specific source or case].
   - **Position**: sentence-initial after a period or semicolon; occasionally mid-sentence in parentheses
   
   **Root Analysis**: for (with the purpose of) + example (instance).
   
   **Etymology**: In English since Middle English; standard academic connector.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Many outlets misquote statistics. For example, this article rounds 42.6% up to "almost half."
   - Several datasets have missing documentation—for example, the one we got from 2019.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Some sources explicitly document sampling error. For example, the national survey provides standard errors for all estimates.
   - Several countries publish open microdata; for example, Statistics X makes anonymized source files publicly available.

1. **Linking Word**: in contrast (type: phrasal connector)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a statement that is strikingly different from what was just said, often based on a different source or dataset.
   - *Function*: strong contrast
   
   **Synonyms**: by contrast, conversely, on the other hand
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, likewise, in the same way

1. **Linking Word**: similarly (type: connector)

   **When to Use**: Showing that multiple sources, datasets, or cases tell a similar story.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: When differences are more important than similarities.

   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Official data show a rising trend. Similarly, independent datasets confirm the same pattern.

   - Indicates an outcome or consequence that follows from earlier evidence or source problems.
   - *Function*: result/consequence
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, therefore, thus, hence
