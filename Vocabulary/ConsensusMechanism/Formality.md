# ConsensusMechanism Vocabulary: Formality

1. **Original Expression**: PoS is way better than PoW (context: comparing consensus mechanisms)
   
   **Core Intent**: Asserting that proof-of-stake has superior properties compared to proof-of-work
   
   **Casual**: PoS is way better than PoW for most use cases.  
   *Characteristics*: Conversational tone, informal intensifier "way better," abbreviated terms  
   *Use when*: Discussing with peers, informal blockchain communities, casual explanations
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Proof-of-stake offers significant advantages over proof-of-work in several dimensions.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral vocabulary, full technical terms, qualified assertion "several dimensions"  
   *Use when*: Professional discussions, technical blogs, team meetings, business contexts
   
   **Formal**: Proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms demonstrate superior properties relative to proof-of-work across multiple evaluation criteria.  
   *Characteristics*: Precise terminology, objective framing, academic tone  
   *Use when*: Research papers, formal presentations, academic contexts, technical documentation
   
   **Humorous**: PoS basically puts PoW on an energy diet—and it actually works!  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor (energy diet), playful tone, conversational style  
   *Use when*: Engaging presentations, informal talks, rapport-building, Twitter/social media  
   *Avoid when*: Formal research, documentation, senior leadership meetings

   *Characteristics*: Rhetorical question, vivid metaphor (hits a wall), exclamation marks  
   *Use when*: Engaging educational content, conference talks, workshops
   
   **Empathetic**: It's important to understand that during network partitions, the protocol prioritizes safety over liveness—meaning it halts rather than risking inconsistency.  
   *Characteristics*: Preparatory framing ("important to understand"), explains rationale, reframes limitation as design choice  
   *Use when*: Discussing tradeoffs with stakeholders, managing expectations, addressing concerns
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:

   *Characteristics*: Emphatic language ("every time," "completely"), dramatic intensifier  
   *Use when*: Educational presentations emphasizing design philosophy, workshops
   
   **Empathetic**: I know halts are frustrating, but they reflect a deliberate design choice—the protocol protects data consistency even if it means temporary unavailability during network issues.  
   *Characteristics*: Validates frustration, explains rationale, frames as protective feature  
   *Use when*: Incident communications, stakeholder discussions, addressing availability concerns
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
