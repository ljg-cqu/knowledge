   **Common Phrases**: 
   - do a warm-up

   - dynamic warm-up
   
   **Root Analysis**: warm (to raise temperature) + up (particle indicating upward or preparatory direction)

   - A short period of gentle activity after intense exercise that helps the body gradually return to a resting state.
   
   **Synonyms**: recovery phase, post-exercise phase, gradual slowdown

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - do a cooldown
   - five-minute cooldown
   - stretching cooldown
   
   **Root Analysis**: cool (to lower temperature or intensity) + down (particle indicating downward change or decrease)

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Walk a few laps as a cooldown so your legs don’t feel like concrete tomorrow.
   - I always feel better if I do a proper cooldown after running.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - build stamina
   - improve stamina
   - lack of stamina
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Latin root related to "stamen" (thread, strength), no clear modern prefix/suffix breakdown
