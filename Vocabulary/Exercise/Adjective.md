1. **Adjective**: aerobic (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Requiring oxygen to produce energy; describing continuous, moderate-intensity exercise that mainly uses the aerobic energy system.
   - *(In fitness)* Related to activities like jogging, cycling, or swimming that can be sustained for several minutes or more.
   
   **Synonyms**: endurance-based, cardio, oxygen-fueled, heart-health-focused
   
   **Antonyms**: anaerobic, explosive, high-power, sprint-based
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about steady cardio sessions, long runs, or classes like "aerobic dance" that raise the heart rate without reaching maximal intensity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for short, very intense efforts such as heavy lifting or all-out sprints (use "anaerobic" or "high-intensity" instead).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - aerobic exercise
   - aerobic capacity
   - aerobic workout
   
   **Root Analysis**: aero- (air) + -bic (related to life/process)
   
   **Etymology**: From New Latin "aerobius" (living in air), from Greek "aēr" (air) + "bios" (life); adopted into exercise science in the 20th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’m doing more aerobic exercise to help my heart and lungs.
   - A brisk 30-minute walk is a simple aerobic workout.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Aerobic training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces cardiovascular risk.
   - Participants completed three aerobic sessions per week at moderate intensity.

1. **Adjective**: high-intensity (gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Involving a high level of effort, speed, or load, often close to a person’s maximum capacity.
   - *(In training)* Describing intervals or sessions that significantly raise heart rate and breathing.
   
   **Synonyms**: hard, vigorous, intense, demanding, strenuous
   
   **Antonyms**: low-intensity, easy, gentle, light
   
   **When to Use**: Referring to sprints, heavy lifting, HIIT (high-intensity interval training), or any workout that feels very challenging.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid exaggerating; do not call a light walk "high-intensity." In clinical contexts, define intensity precisely (e.g., % of max heart rate).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - high-intensity intervals
   - high-intensity workout
   - high-intensity training block
   
   **Root Analysis**: high (great in degree) + intensity (strength or force of effort)
   
   **Etymology**: General English compound; widely used in sports science after the popularization of interval training.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - That was a seriously high-intensity workout—I’m wiped out.
   - Start with short high-intensity bursts and longer easy recoveries.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve fitness in less total time.
   - The protocol included repeated high-intensity efforts at 90–95% of maximal heart rate.

1. **Adjective**: low-impact (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Putting relatively little stress on the joints because at least one foot stays on the ground and forces are reduced.
   - *(In exercise)* Designed to be gentler on knees, hips, and spine while still providing a training effect.
   
   **Synonyms**: joint-friendly, gentle, easy-on-the-joints, reduced-impact
   
   **Antonyms**: high-impact, jarring, joint-stressing
   
   **When to Use**: Describing workouts suitable for beginners, older adults, or people recovering from injury who need to avoid jumping and pounding movements.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for exercises that include running, repeated jumping, or heavy landings; do not assume low-impact automatically means low-intensity.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - low-impact cardio
   - low-impact options
   - low-impact workout
   
   **Root Analysis**: low (small in amount) + impact (force of one thing striking another)
   
   **Etymology**: Modern fitness term; "impact" from Latin "impactus" (pushed against).
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Try a low-impact workout if your knees hurt when you run.
   - Walking and cycling are good low-impact options.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Low-impact exercise programs are often recommended for individuals with joint degeneration.
   - The class offered low-impact alternatives for participants with knee pain.

1. **Adjective**: cardiovascular (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Relating to the heart and blood vessels.
   - *(In exercise)* Describing activities that mainly train heart and lung function.
   
   **Synonyms**: heart-related, cardio, circulatory (related)
   
   **Antonyms**: non-cardiovascular, purely muscular (in narrow contexts)
   
   **When to Use**: In health and fitness contexts when discussing heart health, blood pressure, and endurance exercise.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech where "heart" or "cardio" sounds more natural; do not use for purely flexibility or balance work.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - cardiovascular fitness
   - cardiovascular health
   - cardiovascular workout
   
   **Root Analysis**: cardio- (heart) + vascular (vessels, tubes carrying blood)
   
   **Etymology**: From Greek "kardia" (heart) + Latin "vascularis" (relating to vessels); common in medical and exercise science language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’m doing more cardio to improve my cardiovascular health.
   - Running is great cardiovascular exercise if you build up slowly.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Regular cardiovascular training can reduce resting blood pressure and improve lipid profiles.

   - really sore legs
   - slightly sore muscles
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old English "sār" (pain, wound), no modern prefix/suffix.

   - My arms are so sore after yesterday’s push-up challenge.
   - You’ll probably feel a bit sore tomorrow—that’s normal.

   - *(In fitness culture)* Having good strength, endurance, and body composition for one’s goals.
   
   **Synonyms**: in shape, physically healthy, conditioned, athletic
   
   **Antonyms**: unfit, out of shape, deconditioned, sedentary
   
   **When to Use**: Informal and semi-formal descriptions of overall physical condition; common in everyday speech and fitness marketing.

   **Root Analysis**: Old English "fitt" (suitable, proper); no modern prefix/suffix.
