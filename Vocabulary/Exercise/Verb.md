   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T/I)* To lengthen muscles and tendons by gently pulling or holding a position in order to increase flexibility or reduce tightness.

   **Synonyms**: lengthen, loosen, extend, warm up, limber up
   
   **Antonyms**: contract, tighten, curl up, shorten
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about preparing the body before exercise, cooling down afterward, or relieving stiffness during the day.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - stretch your hamstrings
   - stretch before running
   - gently stretch
   
   **Root Analysis**: Old Germanic root *strek-* (to draw tight, extend), no modern prefix/suffix.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like to stretch for a few minutes when I get out of bed.

   **When to Use**: Discussing resistance training, rehab exercises, or long-term programs aimed at improving muscular capacity.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very technical strength-science writing where more precise terms ("increase force production") are required; do not confuse with emotional or mental strengthening unless context is clear.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - strengthen your core
   - strengthen the muscles around the knee
   - exercises to strengthen your back
   
   **Root Analysis**: strength (power, force) + -en (verb-forming suffix meaning "to make")

   **Synonyms**: expend, use up, consume (energy), torch (slang), blast (slang)
   
   **Antonyms**: conserve, store, accumulate (energy), rest
   
   **When to Use**: Informal and semi-formal discussions about energy expenditure, weight management, and intensity of exercise.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid suggesting that "burning calories" is the only reason to exercise; in technical writing, prefer "expend energy" or "increase energy expenditure." Do not use for burning skin or injury.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - burn calories
   - burn fat
   - burn more during intervals
   
   **Root Analysis**: Germanic root related to "brennen" (to burn); no clear modern prefix/suffix.
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from "bærnan" (to burn); extended metaphorically to energy expenditure in 20th-century fitness language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - This kind of workout really burns a lot of calories.
   - If you add hills, you’ll burn more in the same 30 minutes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - High-intensity interval sessions were shown to burn more calories per minute than steady-state exercise.
   - Participants who exercised daily burned significantly more energy over 24 hours than controls.

1. **Verb**: recover
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(I)* To return to a normal or improved state after exercise, fatigue, or injury.
   - *(T)* To restore strength, function, or energy levels through rest, nutrition, and low-intensity activity.

   **When to Use**: Talking about the period between workouts, after hard efforts, or during rehabilitation from injury.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - time to recover
   - recover between intervals
   - recover from injury
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (again) + cover (to regain, get back), via French/Latin development
   
   **Etymology**: Old French "recovrer" (get back) from Latin "recuperare" (recover); in sports, used for regaining strength or function after exertion.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Take a minute to recover before the next round.
   - I need a full rest day to recover from that marathon.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Root Analysis**: Possibly from Middle English "shoggen" (to shake); no clear modern morphological breakdown.

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like to jog in the park after work.

   **When to Use**: Talking about strength training, gym sessions, and exercises involving dumbbells, barbells, or machines.

   **Root Analysis**: Old Norse "lypta" (to raise) → Old English "lyftan"; no modern prefix/suffix.
