### Q1: Essence of starting exercise with limited time

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: Busy office worker trying to start exercising  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Individual, Doctor] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You work full-time at a desk job and feel unfit and easily out of breath on stairs. Your doctor recommends "getting more exercise," but your week is packed with commuting, family duties, and social commitments. Friends suggest very different approaches: intense bootcamps, daily long runs, strict gym routines, or just "moving more" during the day. You can realistically spare about 30 minutes on most weekdays and a bit more time on weekends. You feel overwhelmed by options and are unsure what really counts as progress versus just activity.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should drive how you think about starting exercise.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **why each cluster matters**, and **what you would consciously define as out-of-scope for now** (types of exercise or goals you will not focus on).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clarifying a realistic primary goal (basic health and energy, not athletic performance).  
  - Setting a minimum weekly dose (e.g., minutes of brisk walking or simple strength work).  
  - Choosing simple, low-friction activities you can start this week.  
  - Deciding what does *not* count as your exercise plan (e.g., rare extreme classes).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Goal & Scope*: Define success as 3–5 short sessions per week that improve breathing and energy; exclude weightlifting PRs or long-distance races for now.  
  - *Weekly Dose & Simplicity*: Plan specific, repeatable sessions like 30 minutes of brisk walking or basic bodyweight exercises at home; ignore complex programs.  
  - *Environment & Triggers*: Tie sessions to existing routines (after work, during lunch) and prepare clothes/shoes in advance.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine what you actually commit to, preventing paralysis from too many options and keeping the first month focused on simple wins.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track "number of exercise sessions per week" and "minutes of brisk movement" rather than weight or appearance.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Aiming at advanced programs, treating sporadic intense workouts as a plan, or trying to change everything at once.

### Q2: Essence of designing a beginner-friendly workout plan

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Personal trainer designing a 12-week plan for a beginner  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Action] | **Stakeholders**: [Client, Trainer, Doctor] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are a personal trainer working with a new client in their 40s. They want to "get fitter and lose some weight," have a mostly sedentary job, and report mild knee discomfort when going downstairs. Their doctor has cleared them for moderate exercise but warned against sudden, high-impact jumps. The client is motivated but impatient—they show you intense online workouts they want to try. You have 12 weeks, with two in-person sessions per week and guidance for at-home activity. Equipment is limited to basic dumbbells, a mat, and space to walk.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should drive the design of this beginner plan.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** (e.g., Strength / Cardio / Joint Protection) and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster shapes specific decisions** in the plan (exercise selection, progression, and what you avoid).

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Building basic strength around key joints (hips, knees, core).  
  - Using low-impact cardio to improve endurance.  
  - Controlling progression of load and impact to protect the knees.  
  - Encouraging simple at-home movement on non-session days.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Strength & Stability*: Prioritize controlled squats, hip hinges, and core work with light weights, focusing on form; avoid deep knee flexion under heavy load early on.  
  - *Low-Impact Cardio*: Use brisk walking or cycling at moderate intensity instead of jumping or running to respect the knee warning.  
  - *Progression & Habit*: Plan gradual increases in sets and minutes, and prescribe easy daily walking between sessions to build routine.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive which exercises you include, how fast you increase difficulty, and what flashy but risky moves you explicitly exclude.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track "sessions completed per week," "minutes of low-impact cardio," and "reported knee discomfort" (aiming for stable or reduced pain).  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Designing around fat-loss hype instead of joint safety; progressing impact too quickly; ignoring adherence.

### Q3: Essence of balancing training and injury risk in running

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Recreational runner training for a 10K  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Runner, Coach] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are training for your first 10K race in eight weeks. You currently run twice a week for 20–30 minutes at an easy pace. Online plans suggest running 4–5 times per week, adding intervals, hills, and long runs. Recently, you have felt tightness in one shin after runs, though it goes away by the next day. Your life includes a full-time job and family responsibilities, making it hard to add many more sessions. You want to improve your time but are more afraid of getting injured and stopping exercise altogether.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that determine both progress and injury risk.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** to adjust your plan over the next eight weeks.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Weekly running volume (total minutes or distance).  
  - Distribution of easy vs harder sessions.  
  - Rate of change in volume (week-to-week progression).  
  - Early warning signals from the shin (pain pattern).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Training Load*: Cap weekly volume increases (e.g., ≤10–15%), add just one extra easy run rather than several hard runs, and prioritize a single longer run on weekends.  
  - *Intensity & Surfaces*: Keep most runs easy, add only light strides or gentle hills if pain stays mild, and favor softer surfaces when possible.  
  - *Monitoring & Adjustment*: Track pain before, during, and after runs; if it worsens or lasts into the next day, cut volume or seek advice.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters directly control how aggressively you chase performance versus how much you protect your ability to keep exercising at all.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track "weekly minutes run," "number of easy vs harder sessions," and a simple 1–10 shin discomfort rating; prioritize stable pain and gradually rising volume over speed.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Copying advanced plans, adding intensity before volume is stable, or ignoring warning signs.

### Q4: Essence of structuring exercise around recovery

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: Amateur athlete increasing training volume  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Athlete, Coach, Physio, Family] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You are an amateur athlete preparing for a demanding event (half-marathon, long hike, or fitness competition). You plan to double your weekly training volume over the next three months. At the same time, your job is entering a busy season and you sleep less on some nights. You already feel more soreness than usual and occasionally wake up tired. A coach suggests recovery strategies—better sleep, nutrition, lighter days—but you are tempted to focus mainly on "getting the work in." Your family is also affected by your time away for training.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that govern whether increased training leads to adaptation or burnout.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **metrics and priorities** that let you monitor recovery and adjust training intelligently.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Total weekly training load (volume × intensity).  
  - Sleep quantity and quality.  
  - Planned easy/recovery days.  
  - Subjective fatigue and mood.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Training Structure*: Alternate harder and easier days, avoid stacking multiple maximal sessions, and schedule at least one low-load week every 3–4 weeks.  
  - *Recovery Capacity*: Protect a minimum sleep window (e.g., 7 hours), prioritize post-session nutrition and hydration, and add light movement instead of complete collapse on very tired days.  
  - *Monitoring & Boundaries*: Use simple daily check-ins (resting heart rate, soreness, motivation); if multiple signals worsen, cut volume or intensity for a few days.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape how you adjust your training plan when life stress rises, so you avoid the common trap of training harder while recovery capacity shrinks.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track "hard sessions per week," "average sleep hours," and a 1–5 fatigue score; first cap hard sessions, then protect sleep, then fine-tune volume.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Treating recovery as optional, ignoring life stress, or using stimulants to mask fatigue.

### Q5: Essence of staying consistent with exercise over months

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Remote worker building a long-term exercise habit  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Individual, Manager, Family] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You work remotely and spend most of the day in front of a computer. You often start new exercise routines enthusiastically, then drop them after a few weeks when work gets busy or you feel tired. You want to be consistently active over the next 6–12 months to improve energy, mood, and long-term health. You have access to basic equipment at home and a nearby park. Many online programs promise rapid transformation but require strict schedules and diets that you know you will not sustain.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that most strongly influence long-term exercise consistency.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Define **what is in-scope vs out-of-scope** for your habit-building plan, so it remains realistic.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Making sessions small and easy enough to start even on low-energy days.  
  - Anchoring exercise to stable daily cues (morning routine, end of workday).  
  - Choosing modalities you actually enjoy (walking, light strength, short circuits).  
  - Tracking simple, encouraging metrics rather than chasing rapid body changes.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Design of Sessions*: Plan 20–30 minute, moderate sessions that require minimal setup; avoid routines that feel like all-or-nothing projects.  
  - *Environment & Cues*: Fix 1–2 time slots per day linked to existing habits (e.g., walk after lunch, short workout before dinner), and prepare equipment in a visible place.  
  - *Scope & Metrics*: In-scope: 3–5 sessions per week that improve energy and mood. Out-of-scope: strict bodybuilding goals or dramatic weight loss targets in a few weeks.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine how you trade off ambition against sustainability, so you can maintain exercise through busy periods instead of stopping entirely.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track "active weeks in a row," "sessions per week," and a simple mood/energy score after workouts; prioritize streaks and how you feel over scale weight.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Overcommitting to intense plans, letting one missed week reset everything, or focusing solely on appearance-based outcomes.
