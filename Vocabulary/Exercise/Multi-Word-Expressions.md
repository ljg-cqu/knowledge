1. **Expression**: strength training (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A form of exercise focused on increasing muscular strength and size by working against resistance (weights, bands, or bodyweight).
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard fitness term)
   
   **Synonyms**: resistance training, weight training, lifting weights
   
   **Antonyms**: purely aerobic exercise, sedentary lifestyle, passive rest
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about gym programs, home workouts, or rehab plans that center on building muscle and strength.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for sessions that focus mainly on stretching or meditation; do not use when resistance is minimal and the goal is only relaxation.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - strength training program
   - strength training session
   - upper-body strength training
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Strength" naturally combines with "training" to describe systematic practice aimed at increasing force production.
   
   **Root Analysis**: strength (power, force) + training (repeated practice to develop a skill or capacity)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I do strength training twice a week to keep my muscles strong.
   - Adding strength training really helped my running.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Regular strength training can slow age-related muscle loss.
   - The intervention included supervised strength training three times per week.

1. **Expression**: cardio workout (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An exercise session that mainly trains the heart and lungs through continuous movement, such as running, cycling, or brisk walking.
   - *Fixedness*: medium–strong (common informal fitness phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: aerobic workout, cardiovascular session, cardio session
   
   **Antonyms**: purely strength-only session, sedentary time
   
   **When to Use**: Describing activities where heart rate stays elevated for several minutes or longer.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for very short, heavy lifts with long rests; those are strength-focused, not typical "cardio workouts."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - quick cardio workout
   - 30-minute cardio workout
   - low-impact cardio workout
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Cardio" (short for cardiovascular exercise) pairs with "workout" to label a session focused on heart and lung conditioning.
   
   **Root Analysis**: cardio- (heart) + workout (exercise session)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I did a short cardio workout on the bike this morning.
   - On non-lifting days I just do a light cardio workout.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants completed a moderate-intensity cardio workout three times per week.
   - Cardio workouts were prescribed at 60–75% of estimated maximal heart rate.

1. **Expression**: warm-up routine (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A planned sequence of light exercises performed before the main workout to prepare the body.
   - *Fixedness*: medium (common but flexible phrase)
   
   **Synonyms**: warm-up sequence, pre-workout routine, preparation routine
   
   **Antonyms**: cooldown routine, main set, all-out start
   
   **When to Use**: Describing specific dynamic stretches or easy movements carried out at the start of training.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for a single quick stretch; "routine" implies a short sequence with some structure.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - dynamic warm-up routine
   - full-body warm-up routine
   - simple warm-up routine
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Warm-up" describes the goal (raising readiness), while "routine" signals an ordered set of actions.
   
   **Root Analysis**: warm-up (preparatory heating) + routine (fixed sequence of actions)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My warm-up routine is five minutes of light jogging and some leg swings.
   - A good warm-up routine makes the main workout feel much easier.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All sessions began with a standardized warm-up routine lasting ten minutes.
   - The warm-up routine included mobility drills for the hips, shoulders, and ankles.

1. **Expression**: lose weight (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To reduce body mass, usually by lowering body fat through changes in activity and nutrition.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (very common everyday collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: reduce weight, slim down, shed pounds (informal), drop fat
   
   **Antonyms**: gain weight, put on weight, bulk up (for muscle gain)
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about weight-management goals linked to exercise; common in casual and semi-formal settings.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in sensitive contexts without consent; in professional settings, focus on health outcomes ("improve metabolic health") rather than just "lose weight."
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - try to lose weight
   - safely lose weight
   - lose weight gradually
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Lose" naturally pairs with "weight" to describe reduction, similar to "lose fat" or "lose inches."
   
   **Root Analysis**: lose (cease to have) + weight (body mass)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I started walking every day to lose weight.
   - You don’t have to starve yourself to lose weight—move more and eat better.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Participants who followed the program lost weight and improved cardiorespiratory fitness.
   - The goal was to help clients lose weight gradually while preserving muscle mass.

1. **Expression**: build muscle (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To increase the size and strength of muscles through resistance training and adequate nutrition.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (high-frequency fitness collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: gain muscle, put on muscle, increase muscle mass
   
   **Antonyms**: lose muscle, break down muscle, atrophy
   
   **When to Use**: Discussing goals and programs focused on hypertrophy and strength.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for programs that only maintain or tone existing muscle without increasing size; do not confuse with gaining weight from fat.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - build lean muscle
   - build muscle and strength
   - build muscle over time
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "Build" suggests constructing something stronger, making it a natural partner for "muscle" when describing growth.
   
   **Root Analysis**: build (construct, develop) + muscle (contractile tissue)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I’m lifting heavier now because I want to build muscle.
   - You can build muscle even with bodyweight exercises if you push hard enough.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Progressive resistance training is an effective way to build muscle in older adults.
   - The protocol was designed to build muscle while minimizing joint stress.
