   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Higher authority requires formal; peers allow casual
   - *Social Distance*: New relationships require semi-formal/formal; established relationships allow casual
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Strategic decisions require formal; routine matters allow casual
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures prefer formal workplace communication regardless of relationship
   - *Medium*: Written communication typically one level more formal than spoken
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using casual language in high-stakes situations: "Let's just agree and move on" in board meeting (too dismissive)
   - Using overly formal language with familiar teams: "It is imperative we achieve consensus" with close colleagues (creates unnecessary distance)
   - Missing empathetic tone when disagreement exists: "We need consensus" without acknowledging different views (can feel dismissive)
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In high-context cultures (Asian, Middle Eastern), direct statements about "needing consensus" may be considered too blunt; prefer indirect approaches emphasizing harmony and collective benefit.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Weekly team meeting with close colleagues discussing lunch venue → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("We all need to agree on this")—low stakes, familiar relationships
   - **Situation 2**: Department meeting with manager present discussing project priorities → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("We should work toward reaching consensus")—professional context, some power distance

   *Avoid when*: Serious disagreements, formal contexts, when humor might undermine message
   
   **Lively**: Hmm, I'm thinking we could actually take this in a totally different direction!  
   *Characteristics*: Enthusiasm markers ("totally different"), forward-looking framing, energetic tone  
   *Use when*: Brainstorming, innovative discussions, when encouraging alternative thinking
   
   **Empathetic**: I hear what you're proposing, and I appreciate the thought behind it, though I'm wondering if we might consider an alternative that addresses [specific concern].

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Being too direct with superiors: "That won't work" to a manager (can appear disrespectful or insubordinate)
   - Being too indirect with peers: "I respectfully submit an alternative perspective" to close team members (creates unnecessary distance)
   - Disagreeing without offering alternatives: "I disagree" without constructive suggestion (appears oppositional rather than collaborative)
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In collectivist cultures, public disagreement may be avoided in favor of private conversations; in some Asian cultures, direct disagreement in meetings can cause loss of face for the proposer.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Brainstorming session with team members discussing campaign ideas → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual or Lively ("I'm thinking we could take this in a different direction")—creative context, peer relationships

   *Characteristics*: Action-oriented language, energizing tone, forward momentum emphasis  
   *Use when*: Dynamic discussions, when energy is flagging, motivating decision-making

   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Being too casual about formal voting: "Let's just vote" in board meeting (undermines procedural gravity)
   - Suggesting votes prematurely: Proposing vote before adequate discussion (can shut down dialogue)
   - Framing votes as win-lose: "Let's vote and the majority wins" (can create divisiveness rather than unity)
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In consensus-oriented cultures (Japanese, Scandinavian), suggesting a vote may be seen as admitting failure to reach agreement; in these contexts, continue discussion until consensus emerges.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Team lunch decision with colleagues → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("Should we just vote on it?")—low stakes, informal context
   - **Situation 2**: Department meeting choosing between two project proposals → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("Perhaps we should proceed with a vote")—professional context, structured decision needed
   - **Situation 3**: Board meeting on strategic acquisition → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("I propose that we resolve this matter through a formal vote")—high stakes, procedural requirements, documented decision

   - Being too vague: "We need more stakeholders" without specifying who or why (lacks actionable clarity)
   - Seeming to delay decisions: Suggesting inclusion when perceived as stalling tactic (can frustrate progress-oriented participants)
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In participatory cultures (Scandinavian, some Western contexts), suggesting broader inclusion is valued; in hierarchical cultures, questioning who should be included may challenge authority's decision-making prerogative.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Team planning meeting discussing internal process → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("We need more people involved")—internal context, peer relationships
   - **Situation 2**: Cross-functional project planning with managers → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("I suggest we expand participation")—professional context, strategic rationale needed

   - Being dismissive: "That's impossible" without offering alternatives or rationale (appears uncooperative)
   - Focusing only on problems: Criticizing timeline without proposing realistic alternative (lacks constructive contribution)
   - Undermining urgency: "We need more time" without acknowledging business drivers (may seem obstructionist)
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In high-urgency business cultures (US), timeline pushback must include clear rationale and alternatives; in relationship-oriented cultures, private discussion before public disagreement is preferred.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Internal team sprint planning with peers → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("That timeline seems too tight")—peer context, iterative planning process
   - **Situation 2**: Project kickoff with cross-functional team and managers → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("I have concerns about feasibility")—professional setting, need for credibility
   - **Situation 3**: Executive review of strategic initiative timeline → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("I respectfully submit that the timeline may present challenges")—high stakes, power distance

   **Cultural Notes**: Compromise is highly valued in Western business culture; however, in some Asian cultures, compromise may be seen as losing face—preference for consensus where all agree rather than compromise where all concede.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Deciding on restaurant with friends → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual or Humorous ("Let's meet in the middle")—low stakes, friendly context
   - **Situation 2**: Resource allocation discussion with department heads → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal ("Perhaps we could find mutually acceptable middle ground")—professional context, competing interests
