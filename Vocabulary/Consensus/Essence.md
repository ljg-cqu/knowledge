1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Consensus*, capture the small set of ideas that explain how groups form shared agreement strong enough to support real decisions and coordinated action, from small teams to large communities and distributed systems.
   - **Scope**: Covers human and organizational consensus processes (meetings, governance, stakeholder alignment) and high-level properties of technical consensus systems (distributed agreement among nodes) when they clarify the core idea of shared agreement. Excludes detailed cryptography, specific blockchain algorithms, formal voting theory, and step-by-step facilitation or negotiation techniques.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What does it really mean to "have consensus" beyond a simple majority vote or absence of complaints?
     - When is it worth paying the cost of seeking consensus, and when is a faster decision mode better?
     - Which structures, roles, and norms make consensus robust instead of performative or coerced?
     - How can dissent, power differences, and minority views be handled without blocking all progress?
     - How do you know if consensus will hold during implementation and over time?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Decision Scope**: operational / tactical / strategic.
     - **Stakeholder Diversity**: low (similar roles and incentives) / medium / high (heterogeneous interests, power, or risk exposure).
     - **Decision Mode**: leader-decides / majority vote / consensus-seeking / consent-based (no strong objections).
     - **Time Pressure**: urgent / time-boxed / open-ended.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Consensus*: Shared agreement and commitment among relevant stakeholders about a decision or direction, strong enough to guide coordinated action.
     - *Dissent*: Explicit disagreement or serious reservation about a proposed decision.
     - *Stakeholder*: A person or group who is affected by, or can significantly affect, the decision and its outcomes.
     - *Facilitation*: The structured guidance of group discussion and decision-making so that all voices are heard and outcomes are clear.
     - *Quorum*: The minimum level of participation required for a decision to be considered legitimate.
     - *Consent (decision-making)*: A standard where a proposal moves forward if no one has a strong, reasoned objection, even if not everyone is enthusiastic.
     - *Groupthink*: A pattern where pressure for harmony or conformity leads people to suppress doubts, creating the illusion of consensus.

1. Q: Essence card – Consensus as shared commitment, not just a vote
   A:
   - **Label**: Consensus as shared commitment, not just a vote
   - **Core Idea**: Consensus is not the same as a 51% majority or silent room; it is a state where the relevant stakeholders understand the decision, can live with it, and commit to executing it even if it was not their first choice.
   - **Why It Matters**: Treating a bare vote or lack of objections as "consensus" creates fragile decisions that unravel in implementation, with people quietly resisting, delaying, or ignoring what they never truly accepted.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Decision Scope = strategic or cross-cutting; Stakeholder Diversity = medium to high; Decision Mode = consensus-seeking rather than simple majority vote.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - consensus
     - commitment

1. Q: Essence card – When consensus is worth the cost
   A:
   - **Label**: When consensus is worth the cost
   - **Core Idea**: Consensus processes are slower and cognitively expensive, so they are best reserved for decisions that are high-impact, hard to reverse, and depend on sustained cooperation from diverse stakeholders.
   - **Why It Matters**: Overusing consensus bogs organizations down in endless discussion; underusing it leads to formal decisions that lack legitimacy and are quietly undermined. Knowing when to seek consensus is itself a critical decision.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Decision Scope = tactical vs strategic; Stakeholder Diversity = high for multi-team or multi-organization decisions; Time Pressure = time-boxed rather than urgent.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - decision scope
     - reversibility

1. Q: Essence card – Structures and roles that make consensus work
   A:
   - **Label**: Structures and roles that make consensus work
   - **Core Idea**: Effective consensus relies on explicit structures—clear decision owner, facilitator, agenda, ground rules, ways to surface objections, and quorum and threshold rules—rather than informal "let’s just talk until we agree".
   - **Why It Matters**: Without structure, consensus discussions drift, dominant voices take over, and quieter stakeholders disengage; with structure, people know how and when to speak, what counts as a valid objection, and when a decision is truly made.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Decision Mode = formal consensus or consent-based; Stakeholder Diversity = medium to high; Time Pressure = time-boxed with explicit decision points.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - facilitation
     - quorum
     - objection

1. Q: Essence card – Handling dissent and power asymmetry
   A:
   - **Label**: Handling dissent and power asymmetry
   - **Core Idea**: Real consensus requires that dissenting and less powerful voices can surface concerns without retaliation, and that the process has ways to integrate, mitigate, or explicitly override those concerns.
   - **Why It Matters**: If people expect punishment, reputation damage, or futility when they object, they stay silent and you get fake consensus; risks stay hidden until failure, and trust in the process erodes.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Stakeholder Diversity = high with unequal power or risk; Decision Scope = strategic or politically sensitive; Decision Mode = consensus-seeking with explicit channels for dissent.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - dissent
     - psychological safety
     - power asymmetry

1. Q: Essence card – Maintaining consensus after the meeting
   A:
   - **Label**: Maintaining consensus after the meeting
   - **Core Idea**: Consensus is tested in execution; it must be documented, communicated, and periodically revisited as conditions change, or it decays into conflicting interpretations and quiet backtracking.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many "consensus" decisions fail because people leave with different mental models, forget the rationale, or face new constraints; maintaining a shared record, clear owners, and review triggers keeps alignment alive.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Decision Scope = operational and strategic follow-through; Time Pressure = ongoing with scheduled review points; Decision Mode = consensus already reached, now being reinforced and adjusted.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - decision record
     - follow-through
     - review cadence
