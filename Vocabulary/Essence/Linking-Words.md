1. **Linking Word**: essentially (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Used to say that you are describing the most important facts about something, not every detail.
   - Used to introduce a summary that captures the core meaning or essence of what has been said, often simplifying details.
   - *Function*: Discourse marker signalling reformulation, simplification, or a shift toward the essential point.
   - Functions as a connector between detailed explanation and an essence-level conclusion.
   
   **Synonyms**: in essence, fundamentally, basically, at heart
   
   **Antonyms**: superficially, on the surface, technically (in contrastive use)
   
   **When to Use**: [Context description - sentence complexity, logical relationships, formality, text type]
   - When moving from complex explanation to an essence-focused summary.
   - In spoken explanations, essays, presentations, and reflective writing.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - grammatical errors, wrong logical relationship, incorrect register, overuse]
   - When precision is more important than simplification.
   - Avoid stacking it with too many other discourse markers ("So, basically, essentially...").
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: Essentially, + [independent clause].
   - [Position]: sentence-initial is most common; occasionally mid-clause for emphasis.
   - [Punctuation]: Usually followed by a comma in writing when sentence-initial.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using it with no real simplification, or as empty filler.
   
   **Root Analysis**: essenti- (being, essence) + -ally (adverbial, functioning as linker)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from *essentia* "essence"; as a discourse marker it developed from the adverb meaning "in an essential way" to a connector meaning "if we focus on the essence."

   - Serves as a bridge from complex discussion to a distilled, essence-focused conclusion.
   
   **Synonyms**: essentially, in summary, at heart, in substance
   
   **Antonyms**: in detail, on the surface, technically speaking (in contrast)
   
   **When to Use**: [Context description - sentence complexity, logical relationships, formality, text type]
   - When transitioning from explanation to a short, essence-focused conclusion.
   - In essays, formal emails, reflective writing, and thoughtful conversation.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - grammatical errors, wrong logical relationship, incorrect register, overuse]

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: In essence, + [independent clause].
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial.
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by a comma in writing.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Following it with jargon-heavy text that hides rather than reveals essence.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (within) + essence (fundamental nature)

   **Root Analysis**: ultimate (last, final) + -ly (adverbial suffix)
