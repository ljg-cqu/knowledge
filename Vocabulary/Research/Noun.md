   **Synonyms**: assumption, proposition, theory (broader), conjecture, tentative explanation
   
   **Antonyms**: finding, fact, conclusion, law, proven result
   
   **When to Use**: In research design, proposals, and papers when describing what the study expects to observe or test; common in academic, scientific, and market/user research.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it to mean a random guess in everyday conversation (prefer "guess" or "idea"); do not confuse with a fully developed theory supported by extensive evidence.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - formulate a hypothesis
   - test a hypothesis
   - confirm / support a hypothesis
   - reject a hypothesis
   - working hypothesis
   
   **Root Analysis**: hypo- (under, less than) + thesis (a placing, proposition)
   
   **Etymology**: Greek → from Greek 'hypothesis' meaning "base, supposition," from 'hypo-' (under) + 'thesis' (a placing, proposition). Adopted into scientific writing in the 17th century to describe testable explanations.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My hypothesis is that people remember things better if they write them down by hand.

   **Antonyms**: guesswork, ad‑hoc approach, unstructured procedure
   
   **When to Use**: When describing the structured way a study is carried out—qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, experimental, survey, ethnographic, etc.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - research methodology
   - qualitative / quantitative methodology
   - mixed‑methods methodology
   - rigorous methodology
   - describe the methodology
   
   **Root Analysis**: method (systematic way of doing something) + -ology (study of)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - training dataset
   - test / validation dataset
   - longitudinal dataset
   - publicly available dataset
   - curate / clean a dataset
   
   **Root Analysis**: data (facts or figures) + set (collection treated as a unit)
   
   **Etymology**: English compound from 'data' (plural of Latin 'datum', given fact) + 'set'. Popularized in statistics and computing in the mid‑20th century with the rise of digital data storage.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - The dataset is messy—there are missing values everywhere.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The final dataset contains 2,413 participants after applying all exclusion criteria.
   - We release our annotated dataset under an open license to support replication and follow‑up studies.

1. **Noun**: variable (C, pl: variables)
   **Meaning**:

   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very informal talk where simpler words like "thing" or "factor" are enough; do not confuse statistical "variable" with programming variables in code unless context is clear.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - independent / dependent variable
   - control variable
   - moderating / mediating variable
   - measure a variable
   - operationalize a variable
   
   **Root Analysis**: vari- (change) + -able (capable of)

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - representative sample
   - random / convenience sample
   - sample size
   - draw a sample
   - sampling frame
   
   **Root Analysis**: From Middle English 'sample' (example, pattern), related to 'assay' and 'example'
   
   **Etymology**: Old French 'essample' (example) → English 'sample' (model, specimen). Statistical sense of "subset used for measurement" emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our sample was pretty small, so we can't say this is true for everyone.

   **Common Phrases**: 
   - conduct a literature review
   - comprehensive / systematic literature review
   - literature review section
   - gap in the literature
   - narrative literature review
   
   **Root Analysis**: literature (body of written work) + review (critical examination)
