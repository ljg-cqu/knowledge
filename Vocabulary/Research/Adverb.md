1. **Adverb**: systematically (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a planned, ordered, and methodical way, following a clear system or procedure.
   - *(In research)* Describing data collection or analysis that follows a predefined protocol.
   
   **Synonyms**: methodically, orderly, step‑by‑step, rigorously, carefully
   
   **Antonyms**: randomly, haphazardly, casually, loosely
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that something is done according to a clear plan rather than ad‑hoc; common in methods and limitations sections.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very informal speech where "step by step" or "in an organized way" sounds more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - systematically collect data
   - systematically review the literature
   - systematically vary conditions
   - systematically analyze responses
   
   **Root Analysis**: system (organized whole) + -atic (relating to) + -ally (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: From "system" + "systematic" + adverbial suffix "‑ly"; widely used in scientific and academic writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We haven’t systematically checked for errors yet—we just skimmed the results.
   - Next time let’s systematically test each feature instead of guessing.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Articles were systematically identified using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   - Potential confounders were systematically controlled across all experimental conditions.

1. **Adverb**: empirically (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a way that is based on observation or experiment rather than theory alone.
   - *(In research)* Using actual data to support, challenge, or refine a claim.
   
   **Synonyms**: in practice, in the data, by observation, through evidence
   
   **Antonyms**: theoretically, hypothetically, conceptually, speculatively
   
   **When to Use**: When contrasting data‑based claims with purely theoretical arguments.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual talk where "in reality" or "in practice" is clearer; do not use when no data were actually collected.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - empirically test
   - empirically supported
   - empirically grounded
   - empirically observed
   
   **Root Analysis**: empirical (based on experience) + -ly (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: From "empirical" (Greek 'empeiria', experience); the adverb "empirically" is common in academic prose.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Empirically, that trick doesn’t seem to help users much.
   - We need to see whether this actually works empirically, not just on paper.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The proposed framework has not yet been empirically evaluated.
   - Our hypotheses were empirically tested using two complementary datasets.

1. **Adverb**: significantly (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - To a large or important extent; in a way that matters.
   - *(In statistics)* At a level unlikely to have occurred by chance, according to a specified significance test.
   
   **Synonyms**: markedly, noticeably, meaningfully, substantially
   
   **Antonyms**: slightly, marginally, insignificantly, negligibly
   
   **When to Use**: In everyday writing for important or noticeable differences; in research writing carefully when referring to statistical tests.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: In formal research articles, avoid "significantly" unless you are reporting statistical significance with proper tests and p‑values.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - significantly higher / lower
   - significantly improve
   - significantly different from
   - not significantly associated with
   
   **Root Analysis**: significant (meaningful or statistically reliable) + -ly (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin 'significare' (to signify). The statistical sense developed in the early 20th century with modern hypothesis testing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The new design significantly reduced the number of user errors.
   - Our workload has significantly increased this semester.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Reaction times were significantly shorter in the treatment condition (p < .01).
   - The intervention did not significantly affect overall completion rates.

1. **Adverb**: approximately (type: degree)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Nearly but not exactly; used when giving an estimate rather than an exact value.
   - *(In research)* Signaling rounding, estimation, or limited precision of measurements.
   
   **Synonyms**: roughly, about, around, more or less, close to
   
   **Antonyms**: exactly, precisely, strictly, accurately
   
   **When to Use**: When reporting rounded numbers, unknown exact values, or back‑of‑the‑envelope estimates.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when exact values are required (e.g., formal definitions, precise formulas).
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - approximately equal to
   - approximately X percent
   - approximately N participants
   - approximately normally distributed
   
   **Root Analysis**: approximate (close to the actual) + -ly (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'approximare' (draw near) → English 'approximate' → 'approximately'.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We had approximately fifty people in the pilot study.
   - The interview took approximately an hour.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The sample consisted of approximately 42% female and 58% male participants.
   - The response time distribution was approximately normal after log transformation.

1. **Adverb**: robustly (type: manner)
   **Meaning**: 
   - In a strong, reliable, and stable way, resistant to failure or small changes.
   - *(In research)* Describing effects, models, or methods that remain valid under different assumptions or analyses.
   
   **Synonyms**: sturdily, strongly, reliably, stably, consistently
   
   **Antonyms**: weakly, unreliably, fragilely, inconsistently
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that findings hold across checks, datasets, or model specifications.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual speech where "holds up well" is clearer; do not overuse unless you have actually run robustness checks.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - robustly associated with
   - robustly predicted
   - robustly supported
   - perform robustly across settings
   
   **Root Analysis**: robust (strong, sturdy) + -ly (in a manner)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin 'robustus' (strong), related to 'robur' (oak). "Robust" and "robustly" became common in statistics and modeling in the 20th century.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The effect seems to hold up robustly even if we change the model a bit.
   - Our system runs robustly even under heavy load.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The main result is robustly replicated across all three independent datasets.
   - The treatment effect remained robustly significant under alternative model specifications.
