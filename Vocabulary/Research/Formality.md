1. **Original Expression**: "We don't know yet."  
   **Context**: Researchers discussing an open question or uncertain result.
   
   **Core Intent**: To state that current evidence is insufficient and that the answer is still unknown.
   
   **Casual**: We honestly have no idea yet.  
   *Characteristics*: Very informal, first‑person plural, uses "no idea" for emphasis.  
   *Use when*: Talking with friends, classmates, or close colleagues in relaxed settings.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: We don't have a clear answer yet.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral tone, contractions allowed, avoids slang.  
   *Use when*: Team meetings, emails between colleagues, presentations to non‑expert audiences.
   
   **Formal**: The available evidence does not yet allow for a definitive conclusion.  
   *Characteristics*: Passive or impersonal phrasing, no contractions, precise vocabulary.  
   *Use when*: Research papers, conference talks, formal reports, communication with reviewers.
   
   **Humorous**: At this point, your guess is almost as good as ours.  
   *Characteristics*: Light self‑deprecation, exaggeration, friendly tone.  
   *Use when*: Informal talks, workshops, or internal presentations where humor is welcome.  
   *Avoid when*: High‑stakes reviews, funding pitches, or with very formal audiences.
   
   **Lively**: Right now, this is exactly the mystery we're trying to crack.  
   *Characteristics*: Energetic metaphor ("crack"), present‑focused, engaging.  
   *Use when*: Public talks, keynotes, outreach events where enthusiasm helps.
   
   **Empathetic**: It's completely understandable to want a clear answer, but the current data just don't support one yet.  
   *Characteristics*: Acknowledges listener's feelings, softens the lack of certainty.  
   *Use when*: Communicating uncertain findings to stakeholders, patients, or non‑experts.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use formal phrasing with reviewers, funders, or senior academics; casual variants with peers.
   - *Social Distance*: Greater distance → choose semi‑formal or formal; close colleagues → casual or humorous may be fine.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: Serious decisions (e.g., medical risks) → formal or empathetic, not humorous.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect stronger certainty; explicitly naming uncertainty can still build trust.
   - *Medium*: Written reports and articles favor formal; live talks can mix semi‑formal, lively, and empathetic.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "We have no idea" in high‑stakes settings, which can sound careless rather than careful.
   - Over‑stating certainty (e.g., "We know this is true") when data are weak, which damages credibility later.
   - Using very technical uncertainty phrases with lay audiences (e.g., "confidence intervals overlap") without explanation.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many research cultures, clearly admitting uncertainty is seen as honest and professional, not as weakness—if you also explain what you will do next.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Lab meeting with your supervisor → **Appropriate Variant**: "We don't have a clear answer yet, but here's what we're testing next." (Semi‑formal)
   - **Situation 2**: Conference paper discussion section → **Appropriate Variant**: "The available evidence does not yet allow for a definitive conclusion." (Formal)
   - **Situation 3**: Public outreach talk → **Appropriate Variant**: "Right now, this is exactly the mystery we're trying to crack." (Lively)

1. **Original Expression**: "This is a big problem in the field."  
   **Context**: Describing an important unresolved issue or limitation in a research area.
   
   **Core Intent**: To highlight that a challenge is substantial and widely recognized.
   
   **Casual**: This is a huge headache for everyone working on this.  
   *Characteristics*: Metaphor ("headache"), informal emphasis, conversational.  
   *Use when*: Informal chats, hallway conversations, or internal Slack/WeChat messages.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: This is a major challenge in the field.  
   *Characteristics*: Neutral, precise word choice ("major challenge"), no slang.  
   *Use when*: Talks, slides, or emails to colleagues and cross‑functional partners.
   
   **Formal**: This issue represents a substantial, unresolved challenge within the current literature.  
   *Characteristics*: Nominalization ("challenge"), hedged but strong, discipline‑typical phrasing.  
   *Use when*: Papers, funding proposals, review articles.
   
   **Humorous**: If our field had a "boss level," this would definitely be it.  
   *Characteristics*: Gaming metaphor, playful tone.  
   *Use when*: Informal seminars, teaching advanced students, or lightening the mood.
   
   **Lively**: This is the pain point that keeps showing up, no matter which study you look at.  
   *Characteristics*: Vivid metaphor ("pain point"), present‑tense emphasis.  
   *Use when*: Conference talks, product‑research syncs, stakeholder briefings.
   
   **Empathetic**: Many teams struggle with this same issue, so it's completely normal if your results feel messy here.  
   *Characteristics*: Normalizes difficulty, inclusive tone.  
   *Use when*: Mentoring students, supporting practitioners, explaining messy findings.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With senior reviewers or funders, prefer formal; with mentees, empathetic or semi‑formal.
   - *Social Distance*: Greater distance → avoid humorous metaphors that may not land.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For high‑impact failures (patient safety, large‑scale harm) avoid humorous framing.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some communities value directness ("major problem"); others prefer softer phrasing ("ongoing challenge").
   - *Medium*: Written academic work → formal; live talks → semi‑formal + lively is often effective.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Calling everything "a big problem," which weakens the signal when something truly is crucial.
   - Sounding dismissive of prior work ("everyone got this wrong") instead of building constructively.
   - Using overly dramatic language ("disaster," "catastrophe") for normal research limitations.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many academic cultures, it is safer to frame a "big problem" as an "important open question" or "central challenge" rather than as a failure.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Journal article introduction → **Appropriate Variant**: "This issue represents a substantial, unresolved challenge within the current literature." (Formal)
   - **Situation 2**: Internal research sync → **Appropriate Variant**: "This is a major challenge in the field." (Semi‑formal)
   - **Situation 3**: Mentoring a junior researcher → **Appropriate Variant**: "Many teams struggle with this same issue..." (Empathetic)

1. **Original Expression**: "Our study has some weaknesses."  
   **Context**: Acknowledging limitations of one's own research.
   
   **Core Intent**: To be transparent about limitations while preserving credibility.
   
   **Casual**: Our study definitely has some rough edges.  
   *Characteristics*: Informal metaphor ("rough edges"), softens the admission.  
   *Use when*: Internal lab discussions, project retrospectives.
   
   **Semi-Formal**: Our study has several limitations.  
   *Characteristics*: Standard phrase in academic writing, neutral tone.  
   *Use when*: Slides, reports, pre‑submission discussions.
   
   **Formal**: This study is subject to several limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the findings.  
   *Characteristics*: Impersonal, hedged, emphasizes responsible interpretation.  
   *Use when*: Articles, theses, systematic reviews.
   
   **Humorous**: Our study is not perfect—it's more of a "version 1.0" than a final release.  
   *Characteristics*: Software metaphor, light self‑awareness.  
   *Use when*: Informal talks with technically savvy audiences.
   
   **Lively**: Think of this study as a strong first step that still leaves important ground to cover.  
   *Characteristics*: Journey metaphor, frames limitations as next steps.  
   *Use when*: Talks, defenses, or stakeholder updates.
   
   **Empathetic**: It's completely normal for a first study to have constraints; what's important is that we're clear about them and plan how to improve next time.  
   *Characteristics*: Normalizes imperfection, supportive tone.  
   *Use when*: Supervising students, debriefing a project team.
   
   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With reviewers/funders → formal; with mentees → empathetic.
   - *Social Distance*: Farther distance → avoid humorous analogies that may underplay seriousness.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For sensitive topics (health, safety), frame limitations carefully and formally.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some communities expect strong self‑critique; others may read it as lack of confidence.
   - *Medium*: Written publications → semi‑formal/formal; live discussions → more room for lively or empathetic phrasing.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "has some weaknesses" without specifying what they are.
   - Being either too harsh ("our data are useless") or too soft ("minor issues") for serious limitations.
   - Hiding limitations, which harms trust when others try to replicate the work.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: A clear, balanced limitations section is often viewed as a sign of maturity and research rigor, not as a flaw.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Thesis discussion chapter → **Appropriate Variant**: "This study is subject to several limitations that should be taken into account..." (Formal)
   - **Situation 2**: Lab meeting → **Appropriate Variant**: "Our study has several limitations, but we can address them in the next iteration." (Semi‑formal)
   - **Situation 3**: 1‑on‑1 with a stressed student → **Appropriate Variant**: "It's completely normal for a first study to have constraints..." (Empathetic)
