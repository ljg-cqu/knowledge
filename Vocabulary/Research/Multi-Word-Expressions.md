1. **Expression**: research question (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A clearly defined question that a study is designed to answer.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard collocation in academic writing)
   
   **Synonyms**: study question, guiding question, central question, focal question
   
   **Antonyms**: answer, conclusion, settled fact
   
   **When to Use**: When specifying the main focus of a study, especially in proposals, introductions, and methodology sections.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it for very vague curiosities; a research question should be specific and answerable.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - main research question
   - guiding research question
   - specific research questions
   - refine the research question
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - *For collocations*: "research" naturally pairs with "question" to indicate an academically framed, answerable problem, not just casual curiosity.
   
   **Root Analysis**: research (systematic investigation) + question (inquiry)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our research question is basically, "Does this actually help real users?"
   - We need to tighten up the research question before we start collecting data.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The primary research question guiding this study is: How does feedback timing affect learner persistence?
   - Our research questions are derived from gaps identified in the prior literature.

1. **Expression**: empirical evidence (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Data‑based support for a claim, obtained through observation or experiment.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (high‑frequency academic collocation)
   
   **Synonyms**: data‑driven evidence, observational evidence, experimental evidence
   
   **Antonyms**: anecdotal evidence, speculation, unsupported claim
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that a statement is backed by systematically collected data.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid calling a single story or isolated case "empirical evidence" in formal writing.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - strong empirical evidence
   - limited empirical evidence
   - growing body of empirical evidence
   - lack of empirical evidence
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - The pairing signals a contrast with purely theoretical or anecdotal arguments; it is conventional in research texts.
   
   **Root Analysis**: empirical (based on experience) + evidence (proof, indication)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - There's not much empirical evidence that this training actually works.
   - We finally have some empirical evidence to back up that hunch.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - There is strong empirical evidence linking sleep quality to academic performance.
   - Empirical evidence for long‑term effects remains limited and mixed.

1. **Expression**: sample size (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - The number of units (participants, cases, items) included in a study or dataset.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (core statistical term)
   
   **Synonyms**: N (statistical notation), number of participants, cohort size
   
   **Antonyms**: population size, census, full enumeration
   
   **When to Use**: In methods, results, and power analyses when stating how many observations you have.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in lay explanations without clarification; some audiences may not know the term.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - small / large sample size
   - adequate sample size
   - increase the sample size
   - calculate required sample size
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Sample" plus "size" forms a standard technical term used across disciplines to describe N.
   
   **Root Analysis**: sample (subset) + size (amount, extent)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Our sample size is too small to say anything strong.
   - We're trying to double the sample size for the next run.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The final sample size was 428 participants.
   - A priori power analysis indicated that a sample size of 300 would be sufficient.

1. **Expression**: statistically significant (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Describing a result that is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, according to a statistical test and a pre‑defined alpha level.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (technical expression)
   
   **Synonyms**: significant at the 0.X level, passes significance test, reliably different
   
   **Antonyms**: not statistically significant, fails to reach significance, non‑significant
   
   **When to Use**: In quantitative results sections when explicitly reporting hypothesis tests.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation where "clearly different" might be better; do not use without specifying the test and criteria in formal work.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - statistically significant difference
   - statistically significant effect
   - not statistically significant
   - statistically significant at p < .05
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - The phrase has a precise meaning in statistics that differs from everyday "significant" (important).
   
   **Root Analysis**: statistic (number‑based summary) + -ally (adverb) + significant (meaningful according to a test)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The change looks big, but it's not statistically significant.
   - We found a statistically significant drop in errors after the update.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The difference between groups was statistically significant, t(98) = 2.67, p = .009.
   - None of the interaction terms were statistically significant at the .05 level.

1. **Expression**: peer-reviewed journal (type: collocation)
   **Meaning**: 
   - An academic journal in which submitted articles are evaluated by independent experts before publication.
   - *Fixedness*: strong (standard academic term)
   
   **Synonyms**: refereed journal, scholarly journal, academic journal
   
   **Antonyms**: non‑reviewed outlet, blog, preprint server (for non‑reviewed versions)
   
   **When to Use**: When distinguishing rigorous scholarly venues from magazines, blogs, or preprints.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid implying that every "peer‑reviewed" journal has equally rigorous standards; quality varies.
   
   **Common Variations**: 
   - publish in a peer‑reviewed journal
   - high‑impact peer‑reviewed journal
   - peer‑reviewed conference proceeding
   
   **Why This Partnership**: 
   - "Peer‑reviewed" and "journal" form a fixed expression for quality‑controlled academic outlets.
   
   **Root Analysis**: peer (equal in status) + reviewed (evaluated) + journal (periodical)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I'm aiming to get this into a peer‑reviewed journal, not just on my blog.
   - Is that result actually published in a peer‑reviewed place?
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - All empirical studies cited here are drawn from peer‑reviewed journals.
   - Publishing in peer‑reviewed journals remains central to academic career progression.
