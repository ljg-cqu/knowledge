### Q1: Essence of framing a research question under constraints

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: F | **RoleContext**: Undergraduate writing a first research proposal  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Student, Supervisor] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You must write a small research proposal for your degree. You are interested in "technology and education," have access to one school, limited time for data collection, and no budget. Your supervisor warns that topics like "impact of technology on learning" are too vague. The department cares that your question is focused, feasible with a small sample, and tied to some measurable outcomes (e.g., grades, engagement, attendance). You have read several broad articles and feel overwhelmed by possibilities. You need to choose a question that is narrow enough to study yet meaningful.

From this situation:
1. Identify the **3–5 most essential levers** that should shape how you narrow and phrase your research question.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **why each cluster matters** for feasibility and clarity, and **what interests or angles you would deliberately leave out**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Focusing on a specific technology, learner group, and outcome (e.g., tablet use and homework completion in grade 8).  
  - Matching scope to access and time (what can be observed or measured within one term at one school).  
  - Clarifying the type of question (descriptive pattern vs explanatory relationship).  
  - Aligning with available, simple measures (attendance logs, assignment scores, short surveys).  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Scope & Boundaries*: Specify population, setting, and outcome; cut away broad "technology and education" claims you cannot test.  
  - *Feasibility*: Tie the question to data you can realistically collect with your access and skills.  
  - *Question Type*: Decide whether you are mainly describing patterns or exploring possible relationships, so wording and design fit.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine which proposal topics you drop and which one you choose, ensuring the question is both meaningful and doable.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize questions where key variables can be counted or rated; track whether your final question can be answered with the data you can actually get.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Keeping the topic broad for interest; choosing outcomes you cannot measure.

### Q2: Essence of choosing a minimal viable research design

**EssenceDimensions**: [ClusterMECE, DecisionLevers] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Master’s student planning an applied research project  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: [Student, Supervisor, Participants] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You have a clear question about whether a new onboarding workshop improves employees’ confidence in using internal tools. You can run surveys, interviews, or short usability tests, but not all three in depth. Your supervisor emphasizes that the study must be ethical, finish in three months, and provide evidence strong enough for the company to decide whether to scale the workshop. HR offers limited access to new hires, and participants already have heavy schedules. You are tempted to include “a bit of everything” to look thorough.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should drive your choice of research design.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** (e.g., Evidence Strength / Practical Constraints / Participant Burden) and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster shapes concrete design decisions** (methods, sample, timing) and what you consciously leave out.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Matching method to decision: the company needs a clear “continue or adapt” signal.  
  - Time and access constraints (three months, limited new hires).  
  - Participant burden and ethics (not overloading new employees).  
  - Need for pre/post comparison to see change.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Decision-Fit Evidence*: Choose one primary quantitative measure (confidence scale before and after) plus minimal qualitative feedback, rather than many shallow methods.  
  - *Operational Constraints*: Design around cohort sizes and onboarding schedule; keep instruments short and simple.  
  - *Ethics & Burden*: Ensure surveys are brief, scheduled at natural breaks, and participation is voluntary.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters dictate whether you run a focused pre/post survey study with a small interview sample instead of a sprawling multi-method design that fails to finish.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Prioritize detectable change in confidence scores and completion rate; defer more exploratory methods to future cycles.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Spreading effort across too many methods; ignoring sample size and timing.

### Q3: Essence of balancing rigor and speed in product experiments

**EssenceDimensions**: [DecisionLevers, MetricsPriorities] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Product analyst running experiments in a startup  
**Criticality**: [Risk, Stakeholders, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Product Manager, Analyst, Engineer, Leadership] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You work at a startup where leadership wants rapid experiments to optimize onboarding. They push for weekly A/B tests on sign-up flows. However, traffic is modest, data is noisy, and engineering capacity is tight. Some previous tests produced “significant” results that later failed to replicate. You suspect weak designs and over-interpretation. At the same time, slowing down too much may lose market opportunities. You need to propose an approach that finds the essence of “enough rigor” without freezing experimentation.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that determine how rigorous and how fast your experiments should be.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** that keep experiments useful without chasing false signals.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Minimum detectable effect vs traffic and time.  
  - Guardrails against false positives (e.g., pre-defined stopping rules).  
  - Cost of wrong decisions vs cost of slower learning.  
  - Engineering effort per experiment.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Statistical & Data Reality*: Agree on realistic effect sizes and required sample; avoid underpowered tests that will be inconclusive.  
  - *Business Risk & Impact*: Use stronger designs (or skip tests) for high-impact, irreversible changes; accept lighter evidence for reversible, low-risk tweaks.  
  - *Execution Capacity*: Limit concurrent experiments to what engineering and analysis can do well.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters determine which experiments you run at all, how long they run, and how you interpret results before changing the product.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Track “percentage of experiments with pre-registered hypotheses and stopping rules,” “share of tests that reach adequate power,” and “reversal rate of experiment-driven decisions.”  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Running many underpowered tests; declaring victory on noise.

### Q4: Essence of synthesizing a messy literature review

**EssenceDimensions**: [SignalVsNoise, ClusterMECE] | **Difficulty**: A | **RoleContext**: PhD student preparing a literature review  
**Criticality**: [Blocks, Stakeholders] | **Stakeholders**: [PhD Student, Supervisor, Committee] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You have collected over 100 papers related to your topic. Many overlap, some contradict each other, and others only loosely relate. Your supervisor insists that your review must “find the essence” of the field, not just summarize paper by paper. They expect 3–5 main themes, clear gaps, and a motivated niche for your own project. You have limited time before a proposal defense and feel lost in details: methods, samples, measures, and terminology differ across studies.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should drive how you organize and synthesize the literature.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Explain **how each cluster shapes what you include, what you collapse, and what you treat as noise or future work**.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Core conceptual distinctions (e.g., types of intervention, populations, or outcomes).  
  - Convergent vs conflicting findings on key relationships.  
  - Methodological patterns that explain differences (designs, measures).  
  - Gaps or under-studied combinations relevant to your question.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Conceptual Map*: Group studies by how they define and target the phenomenon; merge near-duplicates and drop side topics.  
  - *Evidence Patterns*: Within each concept cluster, summarize where findings agree vs diverge, highlighting plausible reasons.  
  - *Gaps & Opportunities*: Identify where important contexts, populations, or methods are thin, leading directly to your proposed study.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters drive the structure of your review chapters and justify your project’s niche; without them, the defense committee cannot see why your study matters.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Aim for 3–5 strong themes, not coverage of every paper; track whether each included paper clearly supports a theme, a conflict, or a gap.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Listing studies chronologically; chasing every minor difference.

### Q5: Essence of communicating research to decision-makers

**EssenceDimensions**: [MetricsPriorities, ScopeBoundaries] | **Difficulty**: I | **RoleContext**: Analyst presenting study results to executives  
**Criticality**: [Stakeholders, Action, Quantified] | **Stakeholders**: [Analyst, Executive, Product Owner, Operations] | **EstimatedTime**: ~10–15 min

**Question (for candidate)**:  
You have completed a solid mixed-methods study on customer onboarding. The analysis includes detailed statistics, multiple charts, and rich quotes. Executives have 20 minutes in a busy roadmap meeting to hear your findings and decide whether to invest in a new onboarding flow. They care about business impact, risk, and next steps more than methodological nuance, but they will challenge weak evidence. You must decide what to highlight, what to tuck into an appendix, and how to frame uncertainty without losing credibility.

From this situation:
1. Identify **3–5 essence levers** that should guide how you present your research.  
2. Group them into **2–3 non-overlapping clusters** and name each cluster.  
3. Propose **simple metrics and priorities** for your presentation so that it drives a clear decision.

**Answer Key (~150–250 words)**:  
- **Target Essence Levers (3–5)**:  
  - Clear, decision-oriented headline findings (what changed, by how much).  
  - Business-relevant metrics (conversion, time to value, support tickets).  
  - Explicit limits and risks (what the study cannot say).  
  - Concrete, prioritized recommendations.  
- **Clusters (2–3, MECE)**:  
  - *Impact & Evidence*: Lead with 1–3 key quantified results tied to business metrics; show only essential visuals.  
  - *Risk & Limits*: Briefly state assumptions, sample limits, and where you are less certain so leaders know how far to trust results.  
  - *Actions & Options*: Present 2–3 concrete options (e.g., pilot, scale, defer) with pros/cons backed by your findings.  
- **Decision Link**: These clusters shape whether executives can make a confident go/modify/no-go decision based on your work.  
- **Metrics & Priorities**: Measure success by “clarity of decision taken in meeting,” “questions about implications vs basic facts,” and follow-up adoption of recommended changes.  
- **Common Failure Modes**: Spending time on methodological detail instead of impact; hiding uncertainty or over-qualifying until no decision feels safe.
