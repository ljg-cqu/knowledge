1. **Adjective**: empirical (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Based on observation, experience, or data rather than theory or speculation. (Non‑gradable, mainly attributive)
   - *(In research)* Describing studies that collect and analyze data from the real world.
   
   **Synonyms**: data‑driven, evidence‑based, observational, fact‑based
   
   **Antonyms**: theoretical, speculative, conceptual, anecdotal
   
   **When to Use**: When emphasizing that a claim, study, or approach is grounded in systematically collected data; common in research articles and proposals.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual conversation when "based on data" is clearer; do not use for purely theoretical or conceptual arguments with no data.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - empirical study
   - empirical evidence
   - empirical findings
   - empirical approach
   - empirical validation
   
   **Root Analysis**: empir- (experience) + -ical (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: Greek → from Greek 'empeiria' (experience) via Latin 'empiricus'. In modern science, "empirical" contrasts with "theoretical" or "speculative" work.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We need empirical proof, not just opinions about what might work.
   - Their claims sound big, but there's not much empirical evidence yet.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - This paper presents empirical results from three large‑scale field experiments.
   - Empirical evidence suggests that frequent, low‑stakes testing improves long‑term retention.

1. **Adjective**: rigorous (gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Extremely thorough, careful, and exact; following strict standards. (Gradable, both attributive and predicative)
   - *(In research)* Describing studies that use appropriate designs, controls, and analyses to minimize bias and error.
   
   **Synonyms**: thorough, strict, meticulous, robust, exacting
   
   **Antonyms**: weak, sloppy, lax, superficial, informal
   
   **When to Use**: When evaluating the quality of research methods, peer review, or experimental design.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very casual settings; in everyday talk "careful" or "thorough" may sound more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - rigorous methodology
   - rigorous experimental design
   - rigorous evaluation
   - scientifically rigorous
   - rigorously controlled
   
   **Root Analysis**: rigor (stiffness, strictness) + -ous (full of, having the quality of)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'rigor' (stiffness, severity) → Old French 'rigoreus' → English 'rigorous' describing strict discipline; extended to scientific quality.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Their study was pretty rigorous—they checked everything twice.
   - We want a more rigorous way to test this idea.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The intervention was evaluated using a rigorous randomized controlled trial.
   - Rigorous replication is essential for building a trustworthy evidence base.

1. **Adjective**: longitudinal (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Involving repeated observations of the same subjects over a long period of time. (Non‑gradable, primarily attributive)
   - *(In research)* Describing studies that track changes across months or years rather than at a single point in time.
   
   **Synonyms**: long‑term, over‑time, follow‑up (broader), panel (related)
   
   **Antonyms**: cross‑sectional, one‑off, snapshot
   
   **When to Use**: When referring to study designs that measure the same people, organizations, or phenomena at multiple time points.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use for one‑time surveys or experiments; avoid in casual speech where "long‑term" is clearer.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - longitudinal study
   - longitudinal data
   - longitudinal design
   - longitudinal analysis
   - longitudinal cohort
   
   **Root Analysis**: long (length) + -itudin- (state or condition of length) + -al (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: From "longitude" (length) in geography; adopted in social and medical sciences in the 20th century to describe over‑time studies.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - They ran a longitudinal study that followed students from high school into their first jobs.
   - Longitudinal data lets you see how people actually change over time.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We report results from a five‑year longitudinal study of teacher burnout.
   - Longitudinal analyses revealed non‑linear growth trajectories in language development.

1. **Adjective**: qualitative (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Involving rich, descriptive information about experiences, meanings, or processes rather than numbers. (Non‑gradable, primarily attributive)
   - *(In research)* Describing methods such as interviews, observations, and open‑ended coding.
   
   **Synonyms**: descriptive, interpretive, narrative, exploratory
   
   **Antonyms**: quantitative, numerical, statistical, metric‑based
   
   **When to Use**: When referring to research focused on understanding how and why, especially through language, stories, or observations.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for studies that are purely numerical; do not use to imply "less scientific"—that is a misconception.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - qualitative study
   - qualitative data
   - qualitative analysis
   - qualitative interview
   - qualitative coding
   
   **Root Analysis**: quality (kind, nature) + -ative (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin 'qualitas' (of what kind). In research, "qualitative" became a standard label in the 20th century to contrast with "quantitative" approaches.
   
   **Examples [Casual**]: 
   - We did a small qualitative study to hear how people actually felt about the change.
   - The qualitative feedback was way more helpful than the numbers alone.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on 48 interview transcripts.
   - Qualitative methods were used to explore participants' lived experiences of remote work.

1. **Adjective**: quantitative (non-gradable)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Involving numbers, measurements, or amounts that can be counted or statistically analyzed. (Non‑gradable, primarily attributive)
   - *(In research)* Describing methods that use structured instruments and statistical analysis to test hypotheses.
   
   **Synonyms**: numerical, statistical, metric‑based, data‑driven
   
   **Antonyms**: qualitative, descriptive (non‑numeric), narrative
   
   **When to Use**: When talking about experiments, surveys with scales, large datasets, or numerical indicators.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for purely descriptive or narrative work; do not assume "quantitative" automatically means "better"—context matters.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - quantitative study
   - quantitative data
   - quantitative analysis
   - quantitative measure
   - quantitative approach
   
   **Root Analysis**: quantity (amount) + -ative (relating to)
   
   **Etymology**: From Latin 'quantitas' (how much). In modern research, "quantitative" labels number‑focused methods, especially from the 20th century onward.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The team prefers a quantitative approach so they can run solid stats.
   - We need some quantitative evidence to back up these interview quotes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The quantitative component used a large‑scale survey with 1,200 participants.
   - Quantitative analyses were conducted using multivariate regression and mediation models.
