1. **Verb**: investigate
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T/I)* To examine something carefully and systematically in order to discover facts or information.
   - *(In research)* To carry out a formal study of a question, phenomenon, or problem using appropriate methods.
   
   **Synonyms**: examine, study, explore, probe, look into
   
   **Antonyms**: ignore, overlook, assume, accept without question
   
   **When to Use**: In academic, scientific, and professional contexts when describing serious, methodical research or inquiry.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in casual situations where "check" or "have a look" is enough; do not use when the action is very informal or superficial.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - investigate a problem
   - investigate whether / how / why
   - investigate the relationship between A and B
   - investigate the impact of X on Y
   - further investigate
   
   **Root Analysis**: in- (into) + vestig- (track, trace) + -ate (verb ending)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'investigare' (to track, search out) from 'vestigium' (footprint, track). Adopted into English in the 15th century, later gaining a specialized research meaning.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We should investigate why users keep dropping off after the second screen.
   - The team is investigating a weird bug in the data pipeline.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - This study investigates the long‑term effects of feedback timing on learning outcomes.
   - Future work should investigate alternative explanations for the observed pattern.

1. **Verb**: analyze
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T)* To examine something in detail in order to understand it better or draw conclusions.
   - *(In research)* To apply statistical, qualitative, or computational techniques to data in order to answer research questions.
   
   **Synonyms**: examine, evaluate, interpret, break down, assess
   
   **Antonyms**: ignore, skim, summarize only, misinterpret
   
   **When to Use**: When describing how data, texts, interviews, or experiments are processed and interpreted in a study.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it for very quick or casual reading; in everyday speech "look at" or "go through" may sound more natural.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - analyze the data
   - analyze results
   - analyze interview transcripts
   - statistically analyze
   - qualitatively analyze
   
   **Root Analysis**: ana- (up, throughout) + lysis (a loosening, breaking down)
   
   **Etymology**: Greek 'analyein' (to loosen up) → Latin 'analysis' → English 'analyze' (17th century) meaning "separate into parts for study"; widely used in scientific and academic writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We still need to analyze last week's survey responses.
   - Let's analyze the experiment results before we make any decisions.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We analyzed the data using multilevel regression models with random intercepts for participants.
   - Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically.

1. **Verb**: collect
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T)* To gather things together from different places.
   - *(In research)* To obtain data, samples, or responses in a systematic way according to a study design.
   
   **Synonyms**: gather, obtain, acquire, record, compile
   
   **Antonyms**: discard, scatter, lose, ignore
   
   **When to Use**: When describing how data, observations, or responses are obtained in experiments, surveys, fieldwork, or log studies.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid in very formal writing when a more specific verb is needed (e.g., "measure", "record", "observe"); do not use when data already exist and are just being reused (use "reuse" or "draw on").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - collect data
   - collect responses
   - collect samples
   - collect evidence
   - collect observations over time
   
   **Root Analysis**: col- (together) + legere (to gather)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'colligere' (gather together) → Old French 'collecter' → English 'collect'. The research sense "gather data" became standard with the rise of empirical methods.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We collected feedback from about a hundred users.
   - The team spent three weeks collecting field notes.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We collected behavioral log data over a six‑month period.
   - Survey data were collected via an online questionnaire hosted on Qualtrics.

1. **Verb**: measure
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T)* To find the size, amount, or degree of something using a standard unit or tool.
   - *(In research)* To assign numbers or categories to a construct (such as satisfaction or performance) using a defined instrument or scale.
   
   **Synonyms**: quantify, assess, gauge, evaluate, determine
   
   **Antonyms**: guess, estimate loosely, ignore, leave unquantified
   
   **When to Use**: In quantitative and mixed‑methods research when talking about how constructs like time, accuracy, engagement, or attitudes are captured.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the process is purely qualitative description; in those cases "describe" or "explore" may be better.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - measure performance
   - measure satisfaction
   - reliably measure
   - measure changes over time
   - measure the effect of X on Y
   
   **Root Analysis**: Latin 'mensura' (measure) → measure (verb)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'mensurare' (to measure) → Old French 'mesurer' → English 'measure'. The research sense emphasizes standardized, reliable assessment.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - We measured how long it took people to finish the task.
   - It's hard to measure creativity with just one question.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Task completion time was measured in seconds using automated logging.
   - We measured perceived usability with a validated 10‑item questionnaire.

1. **Verb**: replicate
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(T)* To repeat something in exactly the same or a very similar way.
   - *(In research)* To repeat a study or analysis to see whether the original findings can be obtained again.
   
   **Synonyms**: repeat, reproduce, rerun, validate (through repetition), confirm
   
   **Antonyms**: contradict, fail to reproduce, diverge from, overturn
   
   **When to Use**: In academic research and data analysis when discussing reproducibility, robustness, or reliability of prior results.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid using it for casual copying ("copy‑paste") where "copy" is clearer; do not claim to "replicate" a study if major design elements were changed.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - replicate a study
   - attempt to replicate previous findings
   - successfully / unsuccessfully replicate
   - direct vs. conceptual replication
   - replication crisis
   
   **Root Analysis**: re- (again) + plic- (fold) + -ate (verb ending)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin 'replicare' (to fold back, repeat) → English 'replicate' (16th century). In modern science, used for repeating experiments to confirm findings.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Another team tried to replicate the results and got something different.
   - Before we publish, we should replicate the analysis on a fresh dataset.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - We independently replicated the original experiment using a larger and more diverse sample.
   - The inability to replicate key findings has raised concerns about the robustness of this research area.
