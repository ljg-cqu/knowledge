1. **Linking Word**: for example (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase used to introduce one or more specific instances that illustrate a more general point.
   - *Function*: Discourse marker signaling exemplification; helps readers connect abstract ideas with concrete cases.
   
   **Synonyms**: for instance, such as, to illustrate, like (informal, inside a list)
   
   **Antonyms**: in general, overall, in principle
   
   **When to Use**: In explanations, essays, and textbooks to add concrete examples that make an abstract idea easier to understand while reading.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use it when you are not actually giving a specific example; avoid using it in every sentence—overuse makes writing repetitive.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [General statement]. For example, [specific case].
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or mid-sentence.
   - [Punctuation]: Usually followed by a comma in formal writing; surrounded by commas when used mid-sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Saying "for example" but giving a summary instead of a concrete case.
   
   **Root Analysis**: for (purpose) + example (a specific instance that represents a group)
   
   **Etymology**: English phrase used since at least the 16th century to introduce illustrative cases in spoken and written language.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Some people love long novels; for example, my brother reads thousand-page books for fun.
   - You can use different reading strategies—for example, skimming first and then reading in detail.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Many factors influence reading comprehension; for example, prior knowledge and vocabulary size are particularly important.
   - Several genres encourage deep engagement with texts—for example, literary fiction and narrative non-fiction.

1. **Linking Word**: however (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A word used to introduce a statement that contrasts with or seems to contradict something that has been said.
   - *Function*: Discourse marker signaling contrast; guides readers through changes in direction in an argument or explanation.
   
   **Synonyms**: nevertheless, nonetheless, even so, still
   
   **Antonyms**: therefore, thus, as a result, consequently
   
   **When to Use**: When you want to show that the next idea contrasts with, limits, or partially disagrees with the previous one in a text.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid putting "however" between two independent clauses with only a comma (comma splice); use a semicolon or full stop instead.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Sentence A]. However, [Sentence B].
   - [Position]: Usually at the beginning of a sentence; sometimes mid-sentence between commas.
   - [Punctuation]: Often preceded by a period or semicolon and followed by a comma.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: "..., however, ..." with only a comma joining two full sentences.
   
   **Root Analysis**: how (in what way) + ever (emphasizer) → fused into a contrastive adverb
   
   **Etymology**: Old English components combined and gradually grammaticalized as a common connector expressing contrast in Modern English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I like reading on my phone; however, my eyes get tired after a while.
   - The book is long; however, it’s worth the effort.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Many learners can decode words accurately; however, their comprehension remains limited.
   - Extensive reading can improve fluency; however, it may not be sufficient for developing academic vocabulary.

1. **Linking Word**: in contrast (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - A phrase used to introduce something that is very different from what has just been mentioned.
   - *Function*: Discourse marker explicitly signaling comparison of differences between two ideas, texts, or groups of readers.
   
   **Synonyms**: by contrast, conversely, on the other hand
   
   **Antonyms**: similarly, in the same way, likewise
   
   **When to Use**: When comparing two reading habits, text types, or results and you want to highlight the difference clearly for the reader.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the difference is minor or vague; "in contrast" usually introduces a clear, strong difference.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Statement about A]. In contrast, [statement about B].
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial or after a semicolon.
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by a comma at the start of a sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "in contrast" without making the two things being contrasted grammatically parallel.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (as part of a phrase) + contrast (difference between things)
   
   **Etymology**: English prepositional phrase that became a fixed discourse marker in academic and expository writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - My sister loves long fantasy novels. In contrast, I prefer short non-fiction pieces.
   - He reads slowly and carefully; she, in contrast, skims everything.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Some students prefer extensive reading; in contrast, others rely mainly on short exam texts.

   **Synonyms**: therefore, consequently, thus, so
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless, on the other hand
   
   **When to Use**: When explaining how a particular teaching method, reading habit, or policy leads to a specific outcome.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the causal link is weak or speculative; instead, use softer language like "may lead to" or "might contribute to".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [Cause]. As a result, [effect].
   - [Position]: Typically sentence-initial or after a semicolon.
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by a comma when used at the beginning of a sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "as a result" repeatedly instead of varying with other result connectors.
   
   **Root Analysis**: as (in the role of) + a result (the outcome)
   
   **Etymology**: English phrase used widely in formal and semi-formal writing to mark consequences clearly.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The book was written in very simple English; as a result, even beginners could enjoy it.
   - I didn’t manage my time well. As a result, I had to skim the last chapter.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Many learners have limited access to interesting books; as a result, their reading motivation declines.

   **Antonyms**: in addition, moreover, furthermore
   
   **When to Use**: When weighing pros and cons of print vs digital reading, different strategies, or two interpretations of a text.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when the second point does not really contrast with the first; also avoid overusing it in very formal writing where more concise connectors may be preferred.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [One side]. On the other hand, [contrasting side].
   - [Position]: Sentence-initial, often after a full stop or semicolon.
   - [Punctuation]: Followed by a comma when starting a sentence.
   - [Common errors to avoid]: Using "on the other hand" without having clearly stated the "first hand" or initial perspective.
   
   **Root Analysis**: on (preposition) + the other (alternative) + hand (metaphor for side or option)
   
   **Etymology**: Idiomatic English phrase originally referring to physical hands as two sides of an argument; now a common contrastive connector in discussion and writing.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Reading on a tablet is convenient; on the other hand, I miss the feel of real pages.
   - Audiobooks are great for commuting; on the other hand, I sometimes lose focus more easily.
