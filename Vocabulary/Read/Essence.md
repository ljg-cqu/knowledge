1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of this source?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *Read*, capture the small set of ideas that define reading as an active, goal-directed skill: turning written symbols into meaning you can understand, remember, and use in decisions, learning, and enjoyment.
   - **Scope**: Covers everyday and professional reading tasks such as emails, articles, reports, textbooks, manuals, and books, with a focus on comprehension, retention, and application. Excludes speaking and listening skills, the detailed mechanics of vision or linguistics, and narrow speed-reading tricks that optimize pace at the cost of understanding.
   - **Central Questions**:
     - What does it actually mean to "read" actively rather than just moving your eyes across lines of text?
     - How should you match your way of reading (skimming, scanning, careful study) to your goal, time, and the difficulty of the text?
     - What makes some texts easier or harder to understand, and what can you change on the reader side to improve comprehension?
     - How can you check and strengthen your understanding so that you can recall and use what you read later?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Purpose of Reading**: Understand / Decide / Learn / Enjoy.
     - **Reading Mode & Depth**: Skim / Scan / Regular reading / Intensive study.
     - **Source Type**: Informational (articles, reports) / Instructional (manuals, tutorials) / Narrative (stories, case studies).
     - **Time Horizon**: Immediate action vs long-term knowledge-building.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Reading*: Active process of decoding written symbols and constructing meaning in your mind for a purpose.
     - *Comprehension*: How accurately and deeply you understand what you read.
     - *Skimming*: Quickly glancing through a text to get its general topic, structure, and main signals.
     - *Scanning*: Moving rapidly through text to locate specific pieces of information (numbers, names, headings).
     - *Annotation*: Adding marks, highlights, or notes to a text while reading to track key ideas, questions, and links.
     - *Background knowledge*: What you already know about a topic that helps you interpret and fill in what the text only hints at.
     - *Reading goal*: The concrete reason you are reading a text now (e.g., pass an exam, fix a bug, decide whether to invest).
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Language, Vocabulary, Cognition, Attention, Learning.
     - **Siblings**: Listening, Writing, Note-Taking, Study Skills, Memory.
     - **Downstream**: Critical Reading, Academic Reading, Research Reading, Evidence Evaluation, Speed Reading.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: [Blocks, Risk, Roles, Action, Quantified].
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: Students, knowledge workers, researchers, managers, language learners, writers, teachers.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.

1. Q: Essence card – Reading as goal-directed meaning construction
   A:
   - **Label**: Reading as goal-directed meaning construction
   - **Core Idea**: Reading is not just following lines with your eyes; it is the deliberate act of turning written symbols into meaning that serves a specific goal such as answering a question, following instructions, or enjoying a story.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without a clear goal and active meaning construction, reading time turns into shallow scanning and vague familiarity; you feel busy but gain little understanding you can actually use.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Purpose of Reading = Understand / Decide / Learn; Time Horizon = immediate action & long-term knowledge-building.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - reading
     - reading goal
     - comprehension

1. Q: Essence card – Matching reading mode to goal and constraints
   A:
   - **Label**: Matching reading mode to goal and constraints
   - **Core Idea**: Effective readers consciously choose between skimming, scanning, regular reading, and intensive study based on their purpose, time budget, and how difficult or important the text is.
   - **Why It Matters**: Using one default pace for everything either wastes time on low-value detail or skips needed depth on critical passages; matching mode to goal lets you cover more material while still understanding what really matters.
   - **Type**: decision
   - **Dimensions**: Reading Mode & Depth = skim / scan / regular / intensive; Purpose of Reading = Understand / Decide / Learn.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - skimming
     - scanning
     - intensive study

1. Q: Essence card – Using text structure as a navigation map
   A:
   - **Label**: Using text structure as a navigation map
   - **Core Idea**: Headings, subheadings, paragraphs, topic sentences, and visual cues form a built-in map of how ideas are organized, telling you where to enter, what to sample, and what to study in depth.
   - **Why It Matters**: Treating structure as a map lets you quickly locate key sections, skip repetition, and connect local details to the overall argument, instead of getting lost in a wall of text.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Source Type = informational / instructional; Reading Mode & Depth = skim / scan vs intensive study.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - heading
     - topic sentence
     - signposting

1. Q: Essence card – Comprehension depends on background knowledge and vocabulary
   A:
   - **Label**: Comprehension depends on background knowledge and vocabulary
   - **Core Idea**: What you can understand from a text is constrained by the concepts and words you already know; the same paragraph feels obvious to an expert and opaque to a beginner.
   - **Why It Matters**: When a text feels "too hard," the bottleneck is often missing background knowledge or key terms; recognizing this helps you slow down, look things up, or study prerequisites instead of blaming your intelligence.
   - **Type**: constraint
   - **Dimensions**: Source Type = technical vs general; Purpose of Reading = Learn / Decide.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - background knowledge
     - vocabulary

1. Q: Essence card – Active reading through questions, annotations, and summaries
   A:
   - **Label**: Active reading through questions, annotations, and summaries
   - **Core Idea**: Active readers constantly ask questions, mark important or confusing parts, and periodically restate the gist in their own words, turning a one-way text into a dialogue with their mind.
   - **Why It Matters**: Questions, annotations, and summaries force you to process and reorganize ideas instead of merely recognizing them; this sharply increases retention and makes it easier to reuse what you read later.
   - **Type**: workflow
   - **Dimensions**: Reading Mode & Depth = intensive study; Time Horizon = long-term knowledge-building.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - annotation
     - question
     - summary

1. Q: Essence card – Monitoring and repairing understanding while reading
   A:
   - **Label**: Monitoring and repairing understanding while reading
   - **Core Idea**: Skilled readers notice when comprehension drops (e.g., mind wandering, terms not making sense) and respond by slowing down, re-reading, checking context, or looking up missing pieces.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without ongoing monitoring and repair, gaps silently accumulate: you reach the end of the page without being able to explain what it said, which makes further reading and later recall fragile.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Purpose of Reading = Understand / Learn; Reading Mode & Depth = regular reading / intensive study.
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - comprehension
     - metacognition
     - re-reading
