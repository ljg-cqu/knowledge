1. **Preposition**: about (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Abstract)* Concerning or on the subject of something (e.g., reading about history).
   
   **Synonyms**: regarding (formal), concerning (formal), on (in many titles), relating to (in some contexts)
   
   **Antonyms**: — (no direct single-word opposite; context-dependent)
   
   **When to Use**: With verbs like "read", "learn", or "hear" to introduce the topic of a text: "read about science", "learn about climate change".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not use it where "around" or "approximately" is required for numbers (e.g., "about 50 pages"); in that case it means "approximately", not "concerning".
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: about reading, about the author, about this chapter
   - **Verb + prep**: read about, learn about, hear about
   - **Adjective + prep**: curious about, excited about (often followed by reading plans)
   - **Noun + prep**: book about, article about, information about
   
   **Root Analysis**: from Old English 'abutan' (on the outside of, about), simplified in modern English
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from 'abutan' (around, on the outside of); the abstract meaning "concerning" developed over time.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I love reading about people who changed their lives through books.
   - She’s reading a novel about a girl who discovers a secret library.

1. **Preposition**: through (type: simple)
   **Meaning**: 
   - *(Spatial)* From one end or side of something to the other.
   - *(Abstract)* From beginning to end of a process or activity, often implying completeness (e.g., read through a chapter).
   
   **Synonyms**: across (spatial), throughout, from beginning to end of (abstract)
   
   **Antonyms**: around (spatial alternative), outside (opposite of inside/through), partly (opposite of completely, as adverb)
   
   **When to Use**: Describing reading an entire text or moving continuously from start to finish: "read through the article", "work through the book".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you only mean "look at" or "open" a text briefly; "through" often implies you have covered the whole thing.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: through the chapter, through the text
   - **Verb + prep**: read through, work through, go through (notes)
   - **Noun + prep**: walkthrough of the text, guide through the book
   
   **Root Analysis**: Germanic root, no clear modern morphological breakdown
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from 'thurh', related to German 'durch'. The figurative sense of completion ("from beginning to end") is central in reading contexts.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I read through the whole article on the train.
   - Let’s go through your essay together and fix the confusing parts.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**:

   **Synonyms**: review (as verb), check, look through, examine (when used with "go over")
   
   **Antonyms**: skip, ignore, overlook
   
   **When to Use**: With verbs like "go", "look", or "run" to describe reviewing a text, especially for errors or main points: "go over your notes", "look over the chapter".
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse with "over" meaning "finished" ("the reading is over"); that is a different use.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Verb + prep**: go over the text, look over your essay, run over the main points
   - **Noun + prep**: overview of the reading (related noun)
   
   **Root Analysis**: over (above, across) without modern affixes
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from 'ofer' (above, beyond). The reviewing sense with reading ("go over") is an idiomatic development.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Let’s go over the reading together before the quiz.

   **Synonyms**: inside (spatial), toward (less precise), regarding (for "look into" = investigate)
   
   **Antonyms**: out of (spatial), ignore (for "look into" as investigate), take at face value (for "read into")
   
   **When to Use**: In reading contexts, especially with the phrasal verb "read into" ("read too much into a sentence") and with verbs like "get into" a book (become deeply involved).
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid overusing "read into" to describe normal interpretation; it usually implies adding extra, perhaps incorrect, meaning.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: into the story, into the text
   - **Verb + prep**: read into, look into, get into (a book)
   - **Adjective + prep**: deeply into reading, really into this novel
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (inside) + to (direction), later written as one word
   
   **Etymology**: Old English → from 'into', a combination of 'in' + 'to'. Figurative uses with reading developed in Modern English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Don’t read too much into that comment; it was just a joke.
   - I really got into the book after the first few chapters.

   **When to Use**: Describing different reading purposes (for fun, for exams, for work) or reading as a means to achieve something.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - **Prepositional phrases**: for pleasure, for information, for homework, for class
   - **Verb + prep**: read for gist, read for detail, study for an exam
   - **Noun + prep**: materials for reading, texts for beginners
   
   **Root Analysis**: Common preposition with Germanic root, no modern breakdown

   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - I mostly read for pleasure in the evenings.
   - She’s reading for her exam tomorrow, so don’t disturb her.
