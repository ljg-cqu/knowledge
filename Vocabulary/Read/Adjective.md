1. **Adjective**: engaging (comp: more engaging, sup: most engaging)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Gradable; typically attributive/predicative. Describes a text that holds your attention and is interesting to read.
   
   **Synonyms**: absorbing, captivating, interesting, compelling, gripping
   
   **Antonyms**: boring, dull, tedious, uninteresting
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about books, articles, or reading materials that keep readers involved and make them want to continue.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for very serious or tragic texts where "moving" or "powerful" fits better than "engaging"; also avoid overusing it in formal reviews without explaining why the text is engaging.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - engaging story
   - engaging article
   - engaging narrative voice
   - highly engaging content
   - engaging reading experience
   
   **Root Analysis**: en- (to cause to) + gage (pledge, commitment) → engage + -ing (present participle/adjective)
   
   **Etymology**: Old French/Latin → from Old French 'engagier' (to pledge), from 'gage' (pledge). The sense "holding attention" developed in Modern English.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The book wasn't super deep, but it was really engaging—I finished it in one night.
   - Our teacher picked an engaging article so we wouldn't fall asleep in class.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - An engaging introduction can significantly improve students' motivation to continue reading.
   - The textbook combines clear explanations with engaging examples drawn from everyday life.

1. **Adjective**: dense (comp: denser, sup: densest)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Gradable; usually attributive. Describes a text that contains a lot of information or complex ideas in a small space, making it difficult to read quickly.
   
   **Synonyms**: packed, information-heavy, complex, overloaded
   
   **Antonyms**: light, simple, easy-to-read, accessible
   
   **When to Use**: Describing academic articles, theoretical books, or technical manuals that require slow, careful reading.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid when you want to praise clarity and simplicity; "dense" often carries a slightly negative or warning tone about difficulty.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - dense textbook
   - dense chapter
   - dense academic writing
   - densely written article
   
   **Root Analysis**: dense (thick, closely packed) with no productive affixes in modern English
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin 'densus' (thick, crowded). The figurative sense of complex or hard-to-understand writing developed later.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The theory chapter is so dense I have to reread every paragraph.
   - This paper is kind of dense—you might want to take notes as you go.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - The article is conceptually dense, assuming substantial prior knowledge of the field.
   - Dense technical prose may discourage less experienced readers from engaging with primary research.

1. **Adjective**: legible (comp: more legible, sup: most legible)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Gradable; usually attributive. Describes writing or type that is clear enough to be read easily.
   
   **Synonyms**: readable, clear, easy-to-read, decipherable
   
   **Antonyms**: illegible, unreadable, messy, unclear
   
   **When to Use**: Talking about handwriting, printed text, screen fonts, or scanned documents in terms of how easy they are to read visually.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Do not confuse it with "comprehensible"; a text can be legible (easy to see) but still hard to understand.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - legible handwriting
   - barely legible notes
   - clearly legible text
   - make it legible
   
   **Root Analysis**: leg- (read) + -ible (able to be)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin 'legibilis' (that can be read), from 'legere' (to read). In English it refers mainly to visual clarity.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - Can you please write more legibly? I can’t read your notes at all.
   - The photocopy is so faint it's barely legible.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Materials were printed in a large, legible font to support readers with visual impairments.
   - Legible annotations are essential when students share their notes with peers.

1. **Adjective**: coherent (comp: more coherent, sup: most coherent)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Gradable; usually predicative/attributive. Describes writing in which the ideas are well-organized and logically connected, making it easy to follow.
   
   **Synonyms**: logical, well-structured, clear, consistent
   
   **Antonyms**: incoherent, disorganized, confusing, fragmented
   
   **When to Use**: Evaluating essays, arguments, reports, and any text where the flow of ideas matters.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid for purely visual clarity issues (use "legible" or "clear"); "coherent" is about ideas and structure, not font size.
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - coherent argument
   - coherent paragraph
   - coherent storyline
   - more coherent structure
   
   **Root Analysis**: co- (together) + her- (stick) + -ent (adjective-forming suffix)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin → from Latin 'cohaerere' (to stick together). In English it came to mean ideas that "stick together" logically.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - After I reorganized my notes, my essay finally felt coherent.
   - The first draft was pretty messy, but the final version is much more coherent.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Coherent paragraphing supports readers in constructing a mental model of the text.
   - The paper presents a coherent synthesis of findings across several studies.

1. **Adjective**: confusing (comp: more confusing, sup: most confusing)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Gradable; predicative/attributive. Describes a text that is hard to understand or follow, often because it is badly organized or unclear.
   
   **Synonyms**: unclear, puzzling, bewildering, hard-to-follow
   
   **Antonyms**: clear, straightforward, easy-to-follow, transparent
   
   **When to Use**: Describing reading materials, instructions, or explanations that leave readers unsure about the meaning.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid as vague criticism in formal feedback; instead combine it with specific reasons (e.g., "confusing because key terms are not defined").
   
   **Common Phrases**: 
   - confusing paragraph
   - confusing instructions
   - extremely confusing chapter
   - find something confusing
   
   **Root Analysis**: con- (together) + fuse (to pour, mix) + -ing (adjective/participle)
   
   **Etymology**: Latin/French → from Latin 'confundere' (to pour together, mix up), via Old French 'confondre'. The participle "confusing" came to describe things that create mental confusion.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - The way this textbook explains grammar is really confusing.
   - I stopped reading because the plot got too confusing.
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - Inconsistent terminology can make otherwise simple texts unnecessarily confusing for learners.
   - Students often report that long, nested sentences are particularly confusing to read.
