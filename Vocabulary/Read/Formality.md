   *Use when*: Talking to close friends or classmates about homework, texting peers, speaking in relaxed settings
   
   **Semi-Formal**: I'm not very motivated to read this right now.  
   *Characteristics*: More neutral vocabulary (motivated), full form (I'm not), explicit time reference (right now)  
   *Use when*: Talking to a teacher you know well, writing in a learning journal, discussing study habits in a workshop
   
   **Formal**: At the moment, I find it difficult to engage with this reading.  
   *Characteristics*: Formal adverbial phrase (at the moment), abstract verb (engage), nominalization (this reading), impersonal tone  
   *Use when*: Reflecting in academic writing, giving feedback in a course evaluation, explaining learning challenges politely
   
   **Humorous**: My brain has officially filed a complaint about this reading and is refusing to cooperate.

   *Use when*: Chatting with friends online, posting about study struggles on social media, breaking the ice in a relaxed study group  
   *Avoid when*: Speaking to teachers in formal contexts, writing assignments, or discussing serious academic problems

   *Use when*: Encouraging classmates to talk honestly about reading load, informal presentations, student-led discussions

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use Formal/Empathetic with teachers or supervisors; Casual/Humorous only with peers.
   - *Social Distance*: With new classmates, prefer Semi-Formal or Empathetic; with close friends, Casual or Humorous is fine.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For serious performance issues, choose Formal/Empathetic; for light complaints, Casual/Humorous is acceptable.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures value direct honesty about study fatigue; others expect more restrained, respectful phrasing.
   - *Medium*: Written reflections and emails favor Semi-Formal/Formal; chat messages and social media posts allow Casual/Humorous.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Saying "I hate this reading" to teachers – sounds emotional and disrespectful instead of constructive.
   - Using very casual slang in academic emails ("This reading sucks") – damages professional image.
   - Hiding problems completely instead of explaining difficulty – teachers cannot adjust support or materials.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many academic cultures, it is acceptable to say a text is challenging if you also show willingness to work on it. Directly criticizing the reading as "useless" or "stupid" can be seen as disrespectful toward the teacher or author.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Email to instructor → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("I find it difficult to engage with this reading and would appreciate some guidance.")
   - **Situation 2**: Chat with friend during a study session → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual/Humorous ("My brain has officially given up on this chapter.")
   - **Situation 3**: Learning reflection journal → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal/Empathetic ("I'm finding it hard to focus on this reading and may need to schedule shorter sessions.")

   *Use when*: Speaking to tutors, colleagues, or more distant classmates; writing polite messages

   *Characteristics*: Formal politeness formula (I would be grateful if...), abstract noun (feedback), indirect request  
   *Use when*: Emailing a supervisor, teacher, or senior colleague about reviewing a draft or document

   *Use when*: Joking with close friends or study partners, keeping the mood light during long reading sessions

   *Use when*: Peer review sessions, writing workshops, collaborative study groups

   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: With teachers or supervisors, prefer Semi-Formal or Formal; with peers, Casual/Lively is usually fine.
   - *Social Distance*: The less you know someone, the more polite and indirect you should be (Semi-Formal/Formal).
   - *Gravity of Situation*: For important documents (applications, reports), use Formal or Empathetic; for quick checks, Casual/Lively works.
   - *Cultural Context*: Some cultures expect very indirect requests ("If you have time..."); others accept direct but polite questions.
   - *Medium*: Emails and written requests favor Semi-Formal/Formal; spoken conversation and chat allow Casual/Humorous.
   
   **Common Mistakes**:
   - Using commands ("Read this.") with people in higher-status roles – can sound rude or demanding.
   - Being too vague ("Look at this?") so the other person is unsure what kind of help you need.
   - Apologizing excessively ("I'm so stupid, can you read this?") instead of making a clear, confident request.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: In many English-speaking academic contexts, direct but polite requests are normal. Adding "please" and a reason ("I'm not sure if this is clear") helps the listener feel respected.
   
   **Context Examples**:
   - **Situation 1**: Email to supervisor → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal ("I would be grateful if you could read this and provide your feedback.")
   - **Situation 2**: Peer review in class → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-Formal/Lively ("Could you please read this and tell me if it sounds natural?")
   - **Situation 3**: Asking a friend in the library → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual ("Can you read this for me and see if it makes sense?")
