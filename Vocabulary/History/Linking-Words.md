1. **Linking Word**: however (type: connector/discourse marker)
   **Meaning**: 
   - Introduces a contrast with the previous statement, showing that what follows goes against what might be expected.
   - *Function*: contrast; often used to show that a different pattern or exception appears in the historical record.
   
   **Synonyms**: nevertheless, nonetheless, even so, by contrast, still
   
   **Antonyms**: therefore, consequently, as a result
   
   **When to Use**: In historical writing, use it to qualify a generalization, introduce an exception, or highlight a different case.
   
   **When NOT to Use**: Avoid starting every sentence with 'however'; overuse makes the text heavy. Do not use it when you really mean 'for example' or 'therefore'.
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - Clause structure: [independent clause]. However, [independent clause].
   - Position: sentence-initial (most common in academic history); sometimes mid-sentence set off by commas.
   - Punctuation: usually followed by a comma when at the beginning of a sentence; in mid-position, it is surrounded by commas.
   - Common errors to avoid: using 'however' to join two independent clauses with only a comma (comma splice); mixing up 'however' and 'but'.
   
   **Root Analysis**: how (in what way) + ever (at any time); together used idiomatically as a contrastive adverb.
   
   **Etymology**: From Old English 'hu' (how) + 'æfre' (ever). Its contrastive meaning developed over time in English prose.
   
   **Examples [Casual]**:

   - *Function*: cause/effect; used to draw out the consequence of historical evidence or argument.
   
   **Synonyms**: consequently, as a result, thus, for this reason
   
   **Antonyms**: however, nevertheless (contrast rather than result)
   
   **When to Use**: When explaining why a certain outcome followed from prior conditions or decisions, such as economic crises leading to political unrest.

   - Clause structure: [cause]. Therefore, [result].
   - Position: sentence-initial or mid-sentence before the verb in formal writing.
   - Punctuation: usually followed by a comma at the beginning of a sentence; set off by commas in mid-position.
   - Common errors to avoid: using 'therefore' to join two independent clauses with only a comma; implying causation where only correlation is shown.
   
   **Root Analysis**: there (in that respect) + fore (before; used as an adverbial ending)
   
   **Etymology**: From Middle English 'therefore' meaning 'for that reason'. Frequently used in academic prose to mark logical conclusion.

   **When to Use**: When describing simultaneous developments in different places, such as 'meanwhile, in the colonies...'.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - Clause structure: [event A]. Meanwhile, [event B].
   - Position: usually at the beginning of the sentence in narrative history.

   **Common Patterns**: 
   - Clause structure: [situation A]. In contrast, [situation B].
   - Position: usually sentence-initial as a separate phrase.
   - Punctuation: followed by a comma when at the beginning of the sentence.
   - Common errors to avoid: mixing up 'in contrast' with 'in comparison', which can be more neutral.
   
   **Root Analysis**: in (introducing a state) + contrast (state of being strikingly different)
   
   **Etymology**: 'Contrast' from French 'contraster' (to stand against), combined with 'in' to form a fixed discourse phrase.
