1. Q: What is the page-level essence (purpose, scope, and organizing structure) of History vocabulary?
   A:
   - **Purpose**: For the topic *History*, capture a compact set of ideas and terms that let you describe past events, explain causes and consequences, talk about change and continuity, and discuss how historians use and interpret evidence.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on high-leverage vocabulary used in school and university history for talking about periods, events, actors, sources, interpretations, and patterns over time. Excludes general everyday words that are not specific to historical description, and excludes specialist jargon from narrow subfields (e.g., detailed military technology, obscure archival codes).
   - **Central Questions**:
     - How do you place events in time and organize the past into clear periods and sequences?
     - How do you talk about causes, consequences, and the significance of events without getting lost in details?
     - How do you describe and evaluate the sources and evidence that historians use?
     - How do you talk about different interpretations, perspectives, and debates about the same past events?
   - **Organizing Dimensions**:
     - **Time & Periodization**: chronology, era, century, long-term vs short-term.
     - **Scale & Perspective**: local / national / global; elites vs ordinary people; state vs society.
     - **Evidence Type**: primary vs secondary sources; quantitative vs qualitative evidence.
     - **Change Pattern**: continuity vs change; turning points; gradual vs sudden transformation.
   - **Minimal Glossary**:
     - *Chronology*: The order in which events happened in time.
     - *Periodization*: The way historians divide history into named blocks such as eras, periods, or ages.
     - *Causation*: How and why events happen, including long-term factors and short-term triggers.
     - *Continuity*: Aspects of life, institutions, or ideas that stay the same over time.
     - *Primary source*: A document, object, or record created at the time being studied.
     - *Secondary source*: A later interpretation or analysis based on primary sources and other evidence.
     - *Interpretation*: A particular explanation or narrative that a historian gives about past events.
   - **Wiki Neighborhood**:
     - **Upstream / Parent**: Time; Society; Politics; Culture; Research methods; Academic writing.
     - **Siblings**: Vocabulary/Source; Vocabulary/Research; Vocabulary/General; Vocabulary/News; Geography vocabulary.
     - **Downstream**: Exam essays; document-based questions (DBQs); historiography; thematic units such as revolutions, imperialism, and social history.
   - **Decision-Critical Metadata**:
     - **Decision Criticality**: Blocks, Risk, Roles, Quantified.
     - **Primary Stakeholders / Roles**: Secondary-school and university history students, teachers, exam-setters, textbook writers, academic historians.
     - **Time Sensitivity**: Evergreen.

1. Q: Essence card – Chronology and periodization as the skeleton of history
   A:
   - **Label**: Chronology and periodization as the skeleton of history
   - **Core Idea**: Words for time and periods—such as century, era, decade, and terms like "early modern" or "postwar"—provide the skeleton on which all historical stories hang by placing events in a clear before/after order.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without solid time vocabulary you cannot describe sequences, compare developments in different places, or see whether something is a slow trend or a sudden break, which blocks clear explanations and exam answers.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Time & Periodization; Scale & Perspective (local, national, global timelines).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - chronology
     - period
     - era
     - century
     - decade
     - periodization

1. Q: Essence card – Causation, consequence, and significance
   A:
   - **Label**: Causation, consequence, and significance
   - **Core Idea**: A small group of words for cause and effect—cause, factor, trigger, consequence, impact, significance—lets you explain why events happened and why they mattered instead of only stating what happened.
   - **Why It Matters**: Most history tasks ask you to explain causes or assess importance; using precise causation vocabulary helps you separate long-term factors from short-term triggers and show the weight of each, which exam markers and readers look for.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Change Pattern (long-term vs short-term); Scale & Perspective (who is affected and how).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - cause
     - factor
     - trigger
     - consequence
     - impact
     - significance

1. Q: Essence card – Change, continuity, and turning points
   A:
   - **Label**: Change, continuity, and turning points
   - **Core Idea**: Terms such as continuity, gradual change, reform, revolution, and turning point give you a compact way to say whether history is mostly staying the same, shifting slowly, or breaking sharply at a key moment.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many courses and essays are framed around "change and continuity over time"; without this vocabulary you can only list events instead of judging whether a period truly changed people’s lives or simply rearranged surface details.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Change Pattern (continuity vs change; gradual vs sudden); Time & Periodization (short vs long term).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - change
     - continuity
     - reform
     - revolution
     - turning point

1. Q: Essence card – Sources, evidence, and reliability
   A:
   - **Label**: Sources, evidence, and reliability
   - **Core Idea**: Source, evidence, bias, reliability, and perspective are core terms for talking about how we know about the past and how much confidence we can place in what a document or object seems to say.
   - **Why It Matters**: History is built from interpreting sources, not just repeating them; being able to say whether a source is primary or secondary, biased or representative, strengthens arguments and prevents naïve or one-sided readings.
   - **Type**: mechanism
   - **Dimensions**: Evidence Type (primary vs secondary; qualitative vs quantitative); Scale & Perspective (whose voice the source represents).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - primary source
     - secondary source
     - evidence
     - bias
     - reliability
     - perspective

1. Q: Essence card – Interpretation, perspective, and historiography
   A:
   - **Label**: Interpretation, perspective, and historiography
   - **Core Idea**: Words like interpretation, narrative, school of thought, revisionist, and historiography let you talk about historians’ debates and how views of the same events change over time.
   - **Why It Matters**: Advanced history work does not stop at "what happened"; it compares how different historians explain events. Without this vocabulary, you cannot summarize debates or show awareness of changing viewpoints in essays or research.
   - **Type**: pattern
   - **Dimensions**: Scale & Perspective (elite vs ordinary people; national vs global views); Evidence Type (how new sources or methods shift interpretations).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - interpretation
     - narrative
     - perspective
     - historiography
     - revisionist

1. Q: Essence card – Scale and context from local to global
   A:
   - **Label**: Scale and context from local to global
   - **Core Idea**: Scale words—local, regional, national, global—and context vocabulary help you show how an event fits into bigger patterns or how large structures and small decisions interact.
   - **Why It Matters**: The same event can look minor locally but major globally (or the opposite); being able to name the scale and context stops you from making exaggerated claims and helps you compare cases across places and times.
   - **Type**: concept
   - **Dimensions**: Scale & Perspective (local / national / global); Change Pattern (linking individual events to broader trends).
   - **Essential Terms**:
     - local
     - regional
     - national
     - global
     - context
