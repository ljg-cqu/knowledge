   **Register Selection Guide**:
   - *Power Distance*: Use the formal version when writing for teachers, examiners, or academic readers; casual versions are best kept for informal speech.
   - *Social Distance*: With people closely connected to this history, empathetic formulations show respect.
   - *Gravity of Situation*: The more serious the harm (famine, war, repression), the more careful and evidence-based the language should be.
   - *Cultural Context*: In some traditions, directly attacking rulers is sensitive; expressions that focus on 'policies' may be safer.
   - *Medium*: Formal/empathetic for books, exhibitions, and reports; casual/lively/humorous for podcasts, videos, and outreach.

   - Saying 'The king was evil' without evidence or nuance.
   - Using jokey or sarcastic language when describing real suffering.
   - Ignoring that some groups may have benefited while others suffered.

   - Using very casual praise ('things got way better') in serious written work.
   
   **Cultural Notes**: How people describe 'improvement' depends on values—some care most about income, others about rights, education, or security; language should allow for different views.
