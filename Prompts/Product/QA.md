## Instructions

### Step 1: Topic Planning

1. Identify 5–6 clusters from content coverage (Strategy & Vision, Discovery & Research, Prioritization & Roadmapping, Metrics & Analytics, Stakeholder Management, GTM & Growth)
2. Allocate 4–6 Q&A per cluster (total 25–30)
3. Assign difficulty distribution: 20% F / 40% I / 40% A

**Self-check**: Sum = 25–30, ratio approximates 20/40/40.

### Step 2: Reference Collection

**Glossary** (≥10 terms): RICE, AARRR, JTBD, North Star, PMF, OKR, Continuous Discovery, PLG, Feature Factory, OST, HEART, Value/Effort Matrix, KANO, V2MOM, Dual-track Agile

**Tools** (≥5 platforms): Mixpanel/Amplitude (analytics), ProductBoard/Aha! (roadmapping), Dovetail/UserTesting (research), Miro (collaboration), segment aggregation tools

**Literature** (≥6 sources): Cagan, Olsen, Torres, Perri, Patton, Klement + ZH sources (俞军, 梁宁, 苏杰)

**APA citations** (≥12): Tag language ([EN], [ZH]), note year and type (1–4), assign IDs (G#/T#/L#/A#)

**Self-check**: Meet floors, language ~60/30/10%, recency ≥50% last 3 years, ≥3 source types.

### Step 3: Q&A Generation

**Question design**:
- Scenario-based: "How would you…" (not "What is…")
- Single unambiguous ask
- Tests product judgment, not trivia
- Enables discussion of trade-offs, opportunity costs, execution challenges
- Matches seniority (Senior: execution, Director: strategy/portfolio, VP: vision/P&L)

**Answer structure**:
- 150–300 words
- Include ≥1 [Ref: ID] citation
- State concrete **Key Insight**: specific user impact, business trade-off, prioritization dilemma, or stakeholder tension this question exposes

**Self-check**: Every 5 Q&A verify word counts, citations, insights, judgment focus.

### Step 4: Artifacts

Create ≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic cluster (journey maps, matrices, dashboards, roadmaps).

**Self-check**: All clusters have visual artifacts.

### Step 5: Reference Sections

Populate Glossary, Tools, Literature, APA Citations with required fields per Output Format Template.

**Self-check**: All [Ref: ID] in answers resolve to entries.

### Step 6: Validation

Execute all validation steps (see Validation & Quality Gates section). Fix failures; re-validate until all pass.

### Step 7: Final Review

Check Question Design Critique Criteria (see Output Format Template). Confirm submission checklist complete.

### Question Design Critique Criteria

Review questions for:

- **Clarity**: Single unambiguous ask
  - ✅ "How would you prioritize between improving activation rate and reducing churn?"
  - ❌ "Explain retention metrics and database optimization strategies"

- **Signal**: Tests product judgment, not trivia
  - ✅ "CEO wants AI in the product. How would you approach this?"
  - ❌ "List the five AARRR steps"

- **Depth**: Enables discussion of trade-offs, opportunity costs, execution challenges
  - ✅ "Choose one: platform API, mobile app, or international expansion. How?"
  - ❌ "Should you build a mobile app? Yes/no"

- **Realism**: Scenarios matching senior/director/VP PM roles
  - ✅ "Sales needs 3 custom features for $5M deal. Engineering says it derails roadmap. What do you do?"
  - ❌ "Design Instagram from scratch"

- **Discriminative**: Tests judgment over recall
  - ✅ "When would RICE prioritization mislead you?"
  - ❌ "What does RICE stand for?"

- **Alignment**: Match seniority (Senior: execution | Director: strategy/portfolio | VP: vision/P&L)

## Example Question

### Q1: How would you evaluate whether to build a new feature requested by your top 5 enterprise customers that represents 40% of revenue, but doesn't align with your product vision for the mass market?

**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Type**: Strategy & Vision, Prioritization & Roadmap

**Key Insight**: Tests tension between short-term revenue protection and long-term PMF; distinguishes PMs who navigate executive pressure from those defaulting to either pleasing customers or rigid vision adherence.

**Answer**:

Use multi-dimensional evaluation [Ref: A1]. **First, discover the job-to-be-done** [Ref: A7]: what problem are customers solving? Surface requests often mask deeper needs revealing generalized solutions [Ref: A6].

**Second, quantify with RICE** [Ref: G2]. Enterprise: Reach (5/$2M), Impact (high retention/low acquisition), Confidence (high), Effort (unknown if custom). Mass-market: Reach (5K+ users), Impact (med/user, high cumulative), Confidence (med), Effort (similar). RICE won't capture strategic value—use decision matrix [Ref: T2].

**Third, assess against North Star Metric** [Ref: G4]. Does this move us toward outcomes or become feature factory [Ref: G9]? If we generalize (e.g., "custom fields" → "flexible schema"), both segments benefit and we strengthen PMF [Ref: G5].

**Finally, explore options**: (1) Generalized version; (2) Premium tier; (3) Professional services; (4) Partner ecosystem. Document precedent—product principles matter [Ref: L3]. Present analysis with clear recommendation, trade-offs, and decision criteria to stakeholders [Ref: T2].

Decision Matrix: Enterprise Request vs. Mass Market Feature

| Criterion                  | Enterprise Feature      | Mass Market Feature      | Weight | Score (E) | Score (M) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Revenue impact (12mo)      | $2M (40% retention)     | $500K (new acquisition)  | 30%    | 9         | 3         |
| Strategic alignment        | Low (custom solution)   | High (vision-aligned)    | 25%    | 2         | 9         |
| Reach (users affected)     | 5 customers             | 5,000+ potential users   | 20%    | 1         | 9         |
| Product velocity impact    | High (custom complex)   | Low (reusable components)| 15%    | 2         | 8         |
| Competitive moat           | Low (replicable)        | High (differentiator)    | 10%    | 3         | 9         |
| **Weighted Score**         |                         |                          |        | **4.8**   | **7.1**   |

Recommendation: Pursue mass market feature + offer enterprise customers premium services engagement
