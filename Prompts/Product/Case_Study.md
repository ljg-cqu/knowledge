## Example Scenario (Product Strategy & Prioritization)

### Scenario 1: Enterprise vs Mass Market Feature Conflict

**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Domain:** Product Strategy, Prioritization

**Context:**

B2B SaaS productivity tool: 50K SMB users ($50/mo avg) + 5 enterprise clients ($200K/yr, 40% ARR). Top enterprise clients request sophisticated custom workflow builder (6mo build).

Product vision: simplicity, self-serve onboarding for mass market. Research [Ref: L4] shows SMBs value ease + quick time-to-value [Ref: G8]. Custom workflow adds UI complexity, requires professional services.

Analytics [Ref: T1] data:
- SMB activation: 65% (core feature within 7d)
- SMB retention (90d): 72%
- Enterprise retention: 95%
- Top 3 features: 80%+ SMB adoption

CEO concerned about enterprise churn. Engineering: custom workflow delays activation improvements by 2Q. Market analysis [Ref: A8]: SMB TAM 10× enterprise, but enterprise more predictable.

Sales: custom feature unlocks 10 enterprise deals ($2M ARR potential). Analytics [Ref: T3]: simplified onboarding improves SMB activation 15% (+7.5K users, +$450K ARR).

**Task 1: Problem Diagnosis & Framework Application (8 pts)**

Apply RICE [Ref: G2] and JTBD [Ref: G3] to analyze both options. What is the core strategic tension? Which framework reveals it best?

**Expected:**
- Strategic tension: short-term revenue vs long-term PMF/expansion
- RICE analysis (both options, actual numbers)
- JTBD: What job do enterprise customers need done?
- Recognition: strategy decision, not just prioritization
- Opportunity cost + product principles [Ref: L3]

**Grading:**
- Strategic tension (not tactical): 2 pts
- RICE with data: 2 pts  
- JTBD to uncover needs: 2 pts
- Framework limitations: 2 pts

**Task 2: Prioritization & Decision Matrix (10 pts)**

Evaluate: (1) Enterprise custom workflow, (2) SMB activation, (3) Generalized builder, (4) Hybrid. Recommend with rationale.

**Expected:**

| Criterion | Enterprise Custom | SMB Activation | Generalized Builder | Hybrid (Services) | Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Revenue impact (12mo) | $2M (enterprise) | $450K (SMB growth) | $1M (both segments) | $1.5M | 25% |
| Strategic alignment | Low (custom) | High (vision-aligned) | High | Medium | 25% |
| PMF impact [Ref: G5] | Negative (complexity) | Positive (easier onboarding) | Positive | Neutral | 20% |
| Reach (users affected) | 5-15 enterprise | 50K+ SMB | All segments | Both | 15% |
| Execution risk | High (custom complexity) | Low (known problem) | High (scope) | Medium | 10% |
| Competitive moat | Low (replicable) | Medium | High | Medium | 5% |

Recommendation with rationale addressing CEO concerns and product principles.

**Grading:**
- Comprehensive criteria: 3 pts (revenue/strategy/PMF/reach/risk)
- All options evaluated: 3 pts (not binary)
- Proper weighting: 1 pt
- Clear recommendation: 2 pts (addresses stakeholders)
- Hybrid/3rd options: 1 pt

**Task 3: Stakeholder Communication (6 pts)**

Draft memo (≤300 words) to CEO/exec team.

**Expected:**
- Situation: Enterprise request, strategic tension, data summary
- Recommendation: Specific path forward with timeline
- Rationale: Decision criteria, scores, why this serves business best
- Risk mitigation: How to protect enterprise relationship
- Success metrics: How you'll measure if decision was right
- Next steps: Immediate actions, timeline, check-in points

**Grading:**
- Clarity and structure: 2 pts (exec-friendly format)
- Data-driven reasoning: 2 pts (metrics, not opinions)
- Addresses concerns: 1 pt (CEO's enterprise worry)
- Actionable next steps: 1 pt (clear path forward)

**Common Product Judgment Gaps:**
- Binary thinking vs exploring 3rd options
- Mechanical framework use without strategic context
- Ignoring opportunity costs
- Not quantifying impact with available data
- No experiments/validation before commitment
- Overlooking execution feasibility
- Missing stakeholder alignment

**Exemplary Approaches for Bonus:**
- Discovery interviews to validate enterprise JTBD: +2 pts
- A/B test/beta for generalized builder de-risking: +2 pts
- Monitoring plan with leading indicators: +1 pt
- Mitigation strategy for enterprise churn: +1 pt
