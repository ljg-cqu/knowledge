## Instructions

### Step 1: Topic Planning

1. Identify 5–6 clusters from content coverage (Market Research & Analysis, Marketing Strategy & Planning, Brand Positioning & Messaging, Customer Segmentation & Targeting, Marketing Channels & Campaign Management, Marketing Metrics & Analytics)
2. Allocate 4–6 Q&A per cluster (total 25–30)
3. Assign difficulty distribution: 20% F / 40% I / 40% A

**Self-check**: Sum = 25–30, ratio approximates 20/40/40.

### Step 2: Reference Collection

**Glossary** (≥10 terms): STP (Segmentation/Targeting/Positioning), 4Ps (Product/Price/Place/Promotion), Marketing Mix, AIDA, Customer Journey, CAC, LTV, Attribution Models, Brand Equity, Market Segmentation, Funnel Metrics, Content Marketing, Inbound Marketing, Account-Based Marketing (ABM), Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)

**Literature** (≥6 sources): Kotler, Ries & Trout, Godin, Sharp, Christensen + ZH sources (菲利普·科特勒, 艾·里斯, 杰克·特劳特)

**APA citations** (≥12): Tag language ([EN], [ZH]), note year and type (1–4), assign IDs (G#/T#/L#/A#)

**Self-check**: Meet floors, language ~60/30/10%, recency ≥50% last 3 years, ≥3 source types.

### Step 3: Q&A Generation

**Question design**:
- Scenario-based: "How would you…" (not "What is…")
- Single unambiguous ask
- Tests marketing judgment, not trivia
- Enables discussion of trade-offs, budget constraints, channel selection, measurement challenges

**Answer structure**:
- 150–300 words
- Include ≥1 [Ref: ID] citation
- State concrete **Key Insight**: specific market opportunity, budget trade-off, channel conflict, or measurement challenge this question exposes

**Self-check**: Every 5 Q&A verify word counts, citations, insights, judgment focus.

### Step 4: Artifacts

Create ≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic cluster (customer journey maps, positioning maps, funnel analysis, channel mix matrices, campaign dashboards).

**Self-check**: All clusters have visual artifacts.

### Step 5: Reference Sections

Populate Glossary, Tools, Literature, APA Citations with required fields per Output Format Template.

**Self-check**: All [Ref: ID] in answers resolve to entries.

### Step 6: Validation

Execute all validation steps (see Validation & Quality Gates section). Fix failures; re-validate until all pass.

### Step 7: Final Review

Check Question Design Critique Criteria (see Output Format Template). Confirm submission checklist complete.

## Example Question

### Q1: How would you determine the optimal marketing channel mix when your CAC has increased 45% year-over-year while your LTV:CAC ratio dropped from 4.5:1 to 2.8:1?

**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Type**: Marketing Metrics & Analytics, Marketing Channels & Campaigns

**Key Insight**: Tests ability to diagnose marketing efficiency deterioration and rebalance channel mix based on unit economics; distinguishes marketers who optimize holistically from those who chase vanity metrics.

**Answer**:

**Diagnose root causes** [Ref: G4, G5]: 45% CAC increase + LTV decline suggests either (1) targeting less-qualified leads, (2) saturating high-performing channels, or (3) competitive pressure [Ref: A11]. Decompose CAC by channel and customer cohort [Ref: T1, T2].

**Analyze attribution** [Ref: G6]: Use multi-touch attribution to identify true channel contribution [Ref: A12]. Last-click models over-credit bottom-funnel channels; time-decay or position-based models reveal assist patterns [Ref: T1]. Compare to blended CAC baseline.

**Evaluate channel health**: Calculate channel-specific LTV:CAC. Healthy channels maintain ≥3:1 [Ref: L1]. Identify: (1) Efficient channels to scale (high LTV:CAC, room to grow); (2) Declining channels to optimize or reduce (saturated, rising CPCs); (3) Testing channels with potential [Ref: A10].

**Rebalance strategy** [Ref: L2]: (1) **Short-term**: Pause/reduce high-CAC channels; reallocate to proven efficient channels; (2) **Medium-term**: Test new channels (organic, partnerships, community) to reduce dependency [Ref: G9]; (3) **Long-term**: Improve conversion rates, increase LTV through retention programs [Ref: T2, T4].

**Framework**: Apply Marketing Mix Modeling [Ref: G6] to simulate budget scenarios. Document baseline, experiments, and results [Ref: T2].
