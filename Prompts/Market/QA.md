## Example Question

### Q1: How would you determine the optimal marketing channel mix when your CAC has increased 45% YoY while your LTV:CAC ratio dropped from 4.5:1 to 2.8:1?

**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Type**: Marketing Metrics & Analytics, Marketing Channels & Campaigns

**Key Insight**: Tests ability to diagnose efficiency deterioration and rebalance mix based on unit economics; distinguishes holistic optimizers from vanity metric chasers.

**Answer**:

**Analysis**: The 45% CAC increase coupled with LTV:CAC dropping from 4.5:1 to 2.8:1 indicates unit economics deterioration [Ref: G4, G5]. This suggests three potential root causes: (1) declining lead quality, (2) channel saturation, or (3) increased competitive pressure [Ref: A11]. First, decompose CAC by channel and cohort using analytics platforms [Ref: T1, T2] to identify specific problem areas.

**Reasoning**: Multi-touch attribution [Ref: G6] reveals true channel contribution better than last-click models, which over-credit bottom-funnel touchpoints while undervaluing awareness and consideration assists [Ref: A12, T1]. Calculate channel-specific LTV:CAC ratios; healthy channels maintain ≥3:1 [Ref: L1]. This analysis distinguishes efficient channels meriting investment from saturated ones requiring optimization or reduction [Ref: A10].

**Recommendations**: Implement a three-phase rebalancing strategy [Ref: L2]: (1) **Immediate**: Pause or reduce spend on channels with LTV:CAC <2:1; reallocate budget to efficient channels; (2) **Medium-term**: Test emerging channels like partnerships, community, and organic content [Ref: G9]; (3) **Long-term**: Improve conversion rates and increase LTV through retention programs [Ref: T2, T4]. Use Marketing Mix Modeling [Ref: G6] to simulate scenarios before major shifts.

**Limitations**: Attribution models have inherent biases; no single model captures perfect causality. External factors (market conditions, seasonality, competitive actions) may confound channel performance metrics. Rapid budget shifts risk losing brand momentum and may undervalue long-term brand-building activities not captured by short-term LTV calculations.
