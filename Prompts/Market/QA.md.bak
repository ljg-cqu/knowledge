## Example Question

### Q1: How would you determine optimal channel mix when CAC increased 45% YoY and LTV:CAC dropped from 4.5:1 to 2.8:1?

**Difficulty**: Advanced | **Type**: Metrics & Analytics, Channels & Campaigns

**Key Insight**: Tests diagnosis of efficiency deterioration and rebalancing based on unit economics; distinguishes holistic optimizers from vanity metric chasers.

**Answer**:

**Analysis**: CAC +45% and LTV:CAC drop from 4.5:1 to 2.8:1 indicates unit economics deterioration [Ref: G4, G5]. Three root causes: (1) declining lead quality, (2) channel saturation, (3) competitive pressure [Ref: A11]. Decompose CAC by channel/cohort using analytics [Ref: T1, T2].

**Reasoning**: Multi-touch attribution [Ref: G6] reveals true contribution vs last-click, which over-credits bottom-funnel while undervaluing awareness [Ref: A12, T1]. Calculate channel-specific LTV:CAC; healthy ≥3:1 [Ref: L1]. This distinguishes efficient channels from saturated ones [Ref: A10].

**Recommendations**: Three-phase strategy [Ref: L2]: (1) **Immediate**: Pause/reduce LTV:CAC <2:1; reallocate to efficient channels; (2) **Medium-term**: Test partnerships, community, organic [Ref: G9]; (3) **Long-term**: Improve conversion, increase LTV via retention [Ref: T2, T4]. Use Mix Modeling [Ref: G6] to simulate before shifts.

**Limitations**: Attribution has biases; no model captures perfect causality. External factors (market, seasonality, competition) confound metrics. Rapid shifts risk brand momentum, undervalue long-term brand-building not in short-term LTV.

**Supporting Artifact**:
```
Channel Mix Analysis & Rebalancing
Current: CAC $180→$261 (+45%) | LTV $810→$730 (-10%) | LTV:CAC 4.5:1→2.8:1 (-38%)
Target: CAC $200 | LTV $900 | LTV:CAC 4.0:1

Channel Performance:
Paid Search  35% | CAC $220 | 3.3:1 → Maintain
Paid Social  25% | CAC $340 | 2.1:1 → Reduce 40%
Content/SEO  15% | CAC $95  | 7.7:1 → Increase
Events       15% | CAC $420 | 1.7:1 → Pause
Email        5%  | CAC $60  | 12.2:1 → Scale 3x
Partnerships 5%  | CAC $140 | 5.2:1 → Test/Expand

3-Month Plan:
M1: Cut Paid Social 40%, Events 100% → Save $200K
M1-2: Increase Content 50%, Email 3x → Invest $100K
M2-3: Test Partnerships, Community, Referral → Invest $100K
Expected: CAC $200 (-23%), LTV:CAC 4.0:1 (+43%)
