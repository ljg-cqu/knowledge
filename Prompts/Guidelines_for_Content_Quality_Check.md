# Content Quality Check Guidelines

**Purpose:** Enable readers to act with minimal clarification.

**Apply all guidelines when content:**
- Blocks decisions/actions
- Has significant impact
- Is time-sensitive
- Affects multiple stakeholders
- Requires substantial effort

Otherwise apply selectively.

## Guidelines (21 Total)

### Foundation

**1. Context** [↓30-40% clarification]: State scope, constraints, assumptions, scale, timeline, stakeholders, resources where relevant. ❌ Title only. ✅ Includes problem, scope, scale/audience, timeline, stakeholders, constraints.

**2. Clarity** [↓25-35% ambiguity]: Define key terms and explain important relationships. ❌ Jargon or specialized terms unexplained. ✅ Key terms defined, relationships explained, domain terminology clarified.

**3. Precision** [↓40-50% specification ambiguity]: Use exact metrics, formulas, units where relevant. ❌ Vague qualifiers ("fast", "scalable", "high-quality", "soon"). ✅ Specific, measurable criteria (numbers, ranges, thresholds, explicit definitions).

**4. Relevance** [↓30-40% noise]: Focus on decision-critical aspects; move non-essential details to appendices. ❌ Extensive background without clear connection to decisions. ✅ Information directly relevant to decisions/tasks; background brief or linked.

### Scope

**5. MECE** [↑40-50% completeness]: Make sections mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. ❌ Coverage has gaps or overlaps. ✅ Distinct, non-overlapping sections covering all relevant aspects.

**6. Sufficiency** [↑35-45% comprehensiveness]: Cover all necessary aspects. ❌ Partial understanding/action only. ✅ All relevant dimensions (what, why, how, when, who, constraints, alternatives, risks, outcomes).

**7. Breadth** [↑30-40% perspective diversity]: Reflect multiple stakeholder perspectives where appropriate. ❌ Single viewpoint/role only. ✅ Acknowledge and address concerns from all relevant stakeholders.

**8. Depth** [↑25-35% thoroughness]: Include implementation-level detail for high-impact areas, not just principles. ❌ Principles/recommendations without supporting detail. ✅ Actionable specifics (options, trade-offs, parameters, concrete examples).

### Quality

**9. Significance** [↓40-60% reading time]: Highlight what matters most, deemphasize low-impact details. ❌ Exhaustive lists of low-relevance items. ✅ Focus on critical elements; link to comprehensive references for completeness.

**10. Concision** [↓35-45% word count]: Avoid redundancy. ❌ Repeat concepts across sections. ✅ State each principle once, then reference; focus on concrete details and examples in subsequent sections.

**11. Accuracy** [↓20-30% factual errors]: Verify facts against authoritative sources. ❌ Claims without verification or outdated information. ✅ Verify facts against current, authoritative sources; flag version-specific or time-sensitive information.

**12. Credibility** [↑50-60% trust]: Cite authoritative sources. ❌ "Best practices say..." with no reference. ✅ Cite specific, authoritative sources (official docs, peer-reviewed research, recognized standards, expert publications).

**13. Logic** [↓30-40% reasoning errors]: Present coherent arguments with explicit trade-offs. ❌ One-sided claims without acknowledging context or limitations. ✅ Balanced analysis with clear reasoning, acknowledged trade-offs, specified conditions where recommendations apply.

**14. Risk/Value** [↑60-80% decision quality]: Compare ≥2 alternatives with costs, benefits, risks. ❌ Single solution with no alternatives. ✅ Multiple options with explicit costs, benefits, risks, and conditions for choosing each.

**15. Fairness** [↓40-50% bias]: Present balanced views, counterarguments, limitations. ❌ Advocate for one approach without addressing downsides. ✅ Multiple perspectives, acknowledged limitations, counterarguments, specify when approach NOT recommended.

### Format

**16. Structure** [↑30-40% scannability]: Use clear headings, sections, lists for scannability. ❌ Long, unstructured text blocks. ✅ Clear headings, bullet lists, comparison tables, visual aids; key information scannable.

**17. Consistency** [↑35-45% readability]: Follow consistent hierarchy and established conventions (H1 title, H2 sections, bullets, tables). ❌ Mixed heading levels and inconsistent formatting. ✅ Predictable, consistent structure following established conventions.

### Validation

**18. Evidence** [↑40-50% trust]: Citations include source details and uncertainty flags. ❌ "Studies show..." with no details. ✅ Specific citations with source, date, page/section; flag estimates, assumptions, areas of uncertainty.

**19. Verification** [↓25-35% errors]: Perform structured self-review. ❌ Finalized without verification. ✅ Verify calculations, check contradictions/inconsistencies, validate examples, confirm assumptions, flag open questions.

**20. Practicality** [↑50-60% implementation speed]: Include concrete steps and examples. ❌ Generic or abstract recommendations only. ✅ Actionable steps, specific examples, commands, formulas, checklists, decision trees where relevant.

**21. Success Criteria** [↑40-50% measurability]: Define measurable outcomes and validation methods. ❌ Vague success criteria ("better performance"). ✅ Specific, measurable targets with baseline, target values, measurement methods, validation approach.

## Quick Check

**Before finalizing:**

☐ **Self-contained**: Key context present; references include summaries and working links  
☐ Context | ☐ Clarity | ☐ Precision | ☐ Relevance  
☐ MECE | ☐ Sufficiency | ☐ Breadth | ☐ Depth  
☐ Significance | ☐ Concision | ☐ Accuracy | ☐ Credibility  
☐ Logic | ☐ Risk/Value | ☐ Fairness  
☐ Structure | ☐ Consistency  
☐ Evidence | ☐ Verification | ☐ Practicality | ☐ Success Criteria

**Exclude or move to references:**
- Extensive background/history (unless essential)
- Pure theory (unless central)
- Low-impact edge cases
- Formal proofs (unless required)
- Trends without data
- Speculation
- References without summary or working link
