# Content Quality Check Guidelines

**Purpose:** Enable action with minimal clarification.

**Apply comprehensively when:** content blocks decisions, has high impact, is time-sensitive, affects multiple stakeholders, or requires substantial effort. **Otherwise apply selectively.**

## Guidelines

### Foundation

**1. Context** [↓30-40% clarification]: State problem, scope, constraints, assumptions, scale, timeline, stakeholders, resources. ❌ Title only. ✅ All context elements present.

**2. Clarity** [↓25-35% ambiguity]: Define key terms and critical relationships; use diagrams for complex structures. ❌ Unexplained jargon/specialized terms. ✅ Key terms defined; diagrams for architectures/workflows/dependencies.

**3. Precision** [↓40-50% specification ambiguity]: Use exact metrics, formulas, units. ❌ Vague qualifiers ("fast", "scalable", "soon"). ✅ Specific, measurable criteria (numbers, ranges, thresholds); formulas for calculations/algorithms.

**4. Relevance** [↓30-40% noise]: Focus on decision-critical information; move non-essential details to appendices. ❌ Extensive background without connection to decisions. ✅ Information directly supports decisions/actions; background brief or linked.

### Scope

**5. MECE** [↑40-50% completeness]: Make sections mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. ❌ Gaps/overlaps in coverage. ✅ Distinct, non-overlapping sections covering all relevant aspects.

**6. Sufficiency** [↑35-45% comprehensiveness]: Cover all necessary dimensions (what, why, how, when, who, constraints, alternatives, risks, outcomes). ❌ Partial understanding/action only. ✅ All dimensions addressed.

**7. Breadth** [↑30-40% perspective diversity]: Reflect relevant stakeholder perspectives. ❌ Single viewpoint only. ✅ Multiple stakeholder concerns addressed.

**8. Depth** [↑25-35% thoroughness]: Include implementation detail for high-impact areas. ❌ Principles without supporting detail. ✅ Actionable specifics (options, trade-offs, parameters, examples).

### Quality

**9. Significance** [↓40-60% reading time]: Highlight critical information; deemphasize low-impact details. ❌ Exhaustive lists of low-relevance items. ✅ Focus on critical elements; link to comprehensive references.

**10. Concision** [↓35-45% word count]: Eliminate redundancy. ❌ Concepts repeated across sections. ✅ Each concept stated once, then referenced; details/examples in later sections.

**11. Accuracy** [↓20-30% factual errors]: Verify facts against authoritative sources. ❌ Unverified/outdated information. ✅ Facts verified; version-specific/time-sensitive information flagged.

**12. Credibility** [↑50-60% trust]: Cite authoritative sources. ❌ Generic claims ("best practices say..."). ✅ Specific citations (official docs, peer-reviewed research, recognized standards).

**13. Logic** [↓30-40% reasoning errors]: Present coherent arguments with explicit trade-offs. ❌ One-sided claims without context/limitations. ✅ Balanced analysis with clear reasoning, trade-offs, conditions.

**14. Risk/Value** [↑60-80% decision quality]: Compare ≥2 alternatives with costs, benefits, risks, selection criteria. ❌ Single solution, no alternatives. ✅ Multiple options with explicit costs, benefits, risks, conditions.

**15. Fairness** [↓40-50% bias]: Present balanced views, counterarguments, limitations. ❌ One approach without downsides. ✅ Multiple perspectives, limitations, counterarguments; specify when NOT recommended.

### Format

**16. Structure** [↑30-40% scannability]: Use clear headings, lists, tables, diagrams. ❌ Long, unstructured text blocks. ✅ Clear headings, bullet lists, comparison tables; diagrams (flowcharts, decision trees, architectures) for complex structures.

**17. Consistency** [↑35-45% readability]: Follow consistent hierarchy and conventions. ❌ Mixed heading levels, inconsistent formatting. ✅ Predictable structure following conventions (H1 title, H2 sections, bullets, tables).

### Validation

**18. Evidence** [↑40-50% trust]: Include source details; flag uncertainty. ❌ Generic claims ("studies show..."). ✅ Specific citations (source, date, page/section); estimates, assumptions, uncertainty flagged.

**19. Verification** [↓25-35% errors]: Perform structured self-review. ❌ Finalized without verification. ✅ Calculations verified, contradictions/inconsistencies checked, examples validated, assumptions confirmed, unknowns flagged.

**20. Practicality** [↑50-60% implementation speed]: Include concrete steps, examples, formulas, diagrams. ❌ Generic/abstract recommendations. ✅ Actionable steps, examples, commands; formulas; diagrams/checklists/decision trees.

**21. Success Criteria** [↑40-50% measurability]: Define measurable outcomes and validation methods. ❌ Vague criteria ("better performance"). ✅ Specific targets (baseline, targets, measurement/validation methods).

## Quick Check

☐ **Self-contained**: Key context present; references summarized with links  
☐ Context | ☐ Clarity | ☐ Precision | ☐ Relevance  
☐ MECE | ☐ Sufficiency | ☐ Breadth | ☐ Depth  
☐ Significance | ☐ Concision | ☐ Accuracy | ☐ Credibility  
☐ Logic | ☐ Risk/Value | ☐ Fairness  
☐ Structure | ☐ Consistency  
☐ Evidence | ☐ Verification | ☐ Practicality | ☐ Success Criteria

**Exclude or move to references:**
- Extensive background/history
- Pure theory (unless central)
- Low-impact edge cases
- Formal proofs (unless required)
- Unsupported trends/speculation
- References without summary/link
