## III. Execution

### Step 1: News Discovery & Curation

**Record generation date (YYYY-MM-DD)**.

1. **Domain**: Industry + geography + workforce theme (e.g., "Global Tech Talent Q1 2025", "EU Manufacturing Skills Q3–Q4 2025")

2. **Web Search** (≥30–40 candidates, tiered):

   **T1 – Talent/Hiring (1–7d)**: `"[Domain] hiring|job openings|talent shortage|skills gap"` | `"[Domain] layoffs|restructuring|RIF"`

   **T2 – Comp/Benefits/Policy (7–30d)**: `"salary survey|compensation report|pay benchmark"` | `"[Country] labor law|remote work|union strike"`

   **T3 – Culture/DEI/Wellbeing (1–6mo)**: Engagement trends, burnout/mental health, DEI outcomes, representation, wellbeing results

   **Sources**: HR/People (SHRM, CIPD, HBR, MIT Sloan, Gartner HR, Deloitte/Bain/BCG) | Comp (Radford, Mercer, WTW, local surveys) | Labor/Policy (ILO, OECD, labor depts, unions, employer assocs) | Research (Gallup, Pew, McKinsey Global Institute, HR/IO journals)

3. **Curate** (≥20 items): Meets freshness + relevance | Quantitative details (wage %, attrition %, engagement, time-to-hire) | Excludes marketing fluff

4. **Verify**: Category & age coverage | Refine if thresholds unmet

5. **Allocate**: Map to stages, categories, roles

### Step 2: Build References

**Format**: G# (glossary) | N# (news) | B# (benchmarks) | L# (law/policy) | R# (research) | A# (APA citation)

Use Markdown refs: `[Ref: N1][n1]` + `[n1]: URL` at end

### Step 2.5: Opportunistic Refresh (optional)

Trigger only if major labor law or large workforce event (cross-industry strike, immigration policy, global health guidance) emerges in 24–72h affecting ≥3 Q&As

### Step 3: Generate Q&A (batch 3–4, self-check)

**Question Patterns**: "[Talent News]: implications for [Stages]/[Roles]?" | "[Comp Benchmark]+[Inflation]: pay strategy for [Segment]?" | "[Law Change]: policy/risk response for [Region]?" | "[Engagement/DEI]: culture/leadership actions for [Business]?"

**Answer Structure** (250–400w):
1. **News** (~60w): What, when, who, why, category `[Ref: N#][n#]`  
2. **Impact** (~110w): ≥2 stages + quantified metrics  
3. **Stakeholders** (~70w): ≥2 roles + concerns + actions + authority  
4. **Decision** (~90w): Invest/Adopt/Adjust/Monitor/Avoid + rationale + 1–2 alternatives + success criteria  
5. **Action** (~60w): Immediate (0–2wks), short (2wks–2mo), medium (2–6mo) + owners  
6. **Projections** (~40w, optional): Scenario forecast + ranges + confidence

**Self-check**: Freshness | ≥2 stages | ≥2 roles | Decision | Quantified | Citations | Concrete actions

### Step 4: Create Visuals

**Diagrams**: Lifecycle flows, recruiting funnels, development paths  
**Tables**: Pay bands, benchmarks, attrition/engagement stats  
**Matrices**: Risk/impact (labor law), culture/responsibility, initiative prioritization

### Step 5–7: Final Validation & Submit

- Validate floors: G, N, B, L, R, A, Q counts  
- Check: Category/role coverage, metrics, timelines, link integrity  
- Fill validation table: Checks, measurement, criteria, status
