# Operations & Supply Chain News Intelligence Q&A

Generate 4–6 decision-critical Q&As from recent industry news for operations leaders. Use web search; self-contained.

**Cadence**: Monthly | 4–6h effort

**Scope**: Decision-critical news (supply disruptions, supplier risk, cost shocks, regulatory/safety changes, capacity constraints).

**Exclusions**: R&D, marketing, incremental improvements, rumors.

**Freshness**: Prioritize recency—majority <2mo, disruptions <1mo, regulatory <6mo.

**Decision Criticality** (≥1 required):
1. Blocks decisions (sourcing, capacity, suppliers)
2. Creates risk (disruptions, incidents, cost shocks >5%)
3. Affects multiple stakeholders
4. Requires action within 6mo
5. Quantified impact

---

## Framework

**Stakeholders**: COO, VP Supply Chain, Plant Manager, Procurement Head, Quality Lead.

**Cycles**: Source → Make → Deliver → Enable (safety, compliance).

**Categories**:
1. Logistics Disruptions
2. Supplier Risk
3. Manufacturing & Capacity
4. Safety & Compliance

---

## Requirements

**Q&A**: 4–6 total, 200–300 words each, news-driven, cited.

**Coverage**: Address all 4 cycles when relevant; emphasize Logistics and Supplier Risk; engage multiple stakeholders.

**References**: Glossary (terms used), News (4-5 items), diverse sources.

**Visuals**: ≥2 diagrams + ≥1 table.

**Quality Checks**:
1. Each Q&A meets ≥1 criticality criterion
2. News cited and fresh; no marketing/rumors
3. Impact spans multiple cycles and roles; quantified
4. Decision clear with rationale and timeline
5. Sources diverse (≥3 types), valid URLs

---

## Execution

### 1. Discovery & Curation
Record date (YYYY-MM-DD) and domain.

**Search**: 10-15 candidates from recent news (prioritize <1mo for disruptions, <2mo general, <6mo regulatory). Use Supply Chain Dive, Logistics Mgmt, IndustryWeek, McKinsey, regulatory sites. Avoid marketing/rumors.

**Curate**: Select 4-5 news items covering multiple categories; verify criticality, check details and metrics.

### 2. Build References
**Glossary**: Define terms used; plain language with analogies.

**News**: Title (Source, MM/DD): Summary | Category | URL | Criticality criterion.

**Citation**: Use [Ref: N1][n1] in text; URLs at end.

### 3. Generate Q&A
**Structure** (200–300w):
1. ### Qn: Question
2. #### News: What/when/why; cite source.
3. #### Impact: Consequences across cycles, quantified.
4. #### Stakeholders: Roles affected, concerns.
5. #### Options & Decision: Alternatives, trade-offs; recommendation with timeline.
6. #### Actions: Next steps, owners, key metrics.
7. #### References: Links.

**Self-Check**: Fresh, critical, multi-cycle/role, clear decision, quantified, cited, actionable.

### 4. Visuals
Add ≥2 diagrams (Mermaid: risk heatmap, decision tree, impact matrix) + ≥1 table.

### 5. Validate
Check: Criticality met, news fresh and cited, impact quantified, decisions clear, sources diverse, URLs valid, visuals included.
