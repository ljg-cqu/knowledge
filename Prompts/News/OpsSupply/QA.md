## Purpose
Generate 4–6 decision-critical Q&As from recent industry news for operations leaders. Use web search; self-contained.

**Context**: Operations leaders need timely, actionable intelligence on supply chain events that require decisions within 6mo. Problem: fragmented news sources, unclear impact. Constraint: limit to decision-critical topics (blocks decisions, creates risk >5%, affects ≥2 stakeholders). Resources: 4–6h/mo effort.

**Cadence**: Monthly

**Key Terms**:
- **Decision-critical**: News requiring action within 6mo or creating risk/disruption >5% impact
- **Supply chain cycles**: Source (procurement) → Make (production) → Deliver (logistics) → Enable (safety/compliance)
- **MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive coverage

**Scope**: Supply disruptions, supplier risk, cost shocks, regulatory/safety changes, capacity constraints.

**Exclusions**: R&D, marketing, incremental improvements, rumors.

**Freshness**: Majority <2mo; disruptions <1mo; regulatory <6mo.

**Decision Criticality** (≥1 required, priority labeled):
1. **Critical**: Blocks decisions (sourcing, capacity, suppliers)
2. **Critical**: Creates risk (disruptions, incidents, cost shocks >5%)
3. **Important**: Affects multiple stakeholders
4. **Important**: Requires action within 6mo
5. **Important**: Quantified impact

## Framework

**Stakeholders**: COO, VP Supply Chain, Plant Manager, Procurement Head, Quality Lead.

**Cycles**: Source → Make → Deliver → Enable (safety, compliance).

**Categories**: Logistics Disruptions | Supplier Risk | Manufacturing & Capacity | Safety & Compliance

---

## Requirements

**Output**: 4–6 Q&As, 200–300 words each, news-driven, cited.

**Coverage**: Address all 4 cycles; emphasize Logistics and Supplier Risk; engage multiple stakeholders.

**References**: Glossary, News sources (diverse, ≥3 types), valid URLs.

**Visuals**: ≥2 diagrams + ≥1 table.

## Execution

### 1. Discovery & Curation
**Search**: Find candidates from authoritative sources:
- Trade media: Supply Chain Dive, Logistics Management (2024+ editions), IndustryWeek
- Consulting: McKinsey Supply Chain, Gartner Supply Chain (current year reports)
- Regulatory: OSHA.gov, FDA.gov (official announcements)
- Industry: Trade associations (e.g., CSCMP, APICS/ASCM current publications)

**Curate**: Cover ≥3 source types, multiple categories, meet criticality criteria (≥1 per Q&A).

**Record**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), domain, news title/source/date, summary, category, URL, criticality criterion.

### 2. Build References
**Glossary**: Define terms in plain language with analogies (e.g., "Just-in-time inventory: ordering supplies only when needed, like a restaurant buying fresh ingredients daily").

**Citations**: Use [Ref: N1][n1] inline; include URLs at end with access date.

### 3. Generate Q&A Structure
1. ### Qn: Question
2. #### News: What/when/why; cite source with date
3. #### Impact: Consequences across cycles, quantified where possible
4. #### Stakeholders: Roles affected, concerns
5. #### Options & Decision: ≥2 alternatives with costs/benefits/risks, trade-offs, recommendation with rationale and timeline
6. #### Actions: Next steps (owners, deadlines), key metrics (baseline → target)
7. #### References: Links with access dates

### 4. Visuals
Add ≥2 diagrams (Mermaid: risk heatmap, decision tree, impact matrix) + ≥1 comparison table (alternatives, pros/cons, costs).

### 5. Verification
**Self-review**: Before finalizing, check:
- ☐ Facts verified against original sources
- ☐ URLs valid and accessible
- ☐ Calculations/metrics accurate
- ☐ No contradictions between Q&As
- ☐ Terminology consistent with glossary
- ☐ Each Q&A meets ≥1 criticality criterion
- ☐ Uncertainties flagged (e.g., "estimated impact pending official data")
