# Operations & Supply Chain News Intelligence Q&A

Generate 4–6 decision-critical Q&As from recent industry news for operations leaders. Use web search; self-contained.

**Cadence**: Monthly | 4–6h effort

**Scope**: Decision-critical news (supply disruptions, supplier risk, cost shocks, regulatory/safety changes, capacity constraints).

**Exclusions**: R&D, marketing, incremental improvements, rumors.

**Freshness**: Majority <2mo, disruptions <1mo, regulatory <6mo.

**Decision Criticality** (≥1 required):
1. Blocks decisions (sourcing, capacity, suppliers)
2. Creates risk (disruptions, incidents, cost shocks >5%)
3. Affects multiple stakeholders
4. Requires action within 6mo
5. Quantified impact

## Framework

**Stakeholders**: COO, VP Supply Chain, Plant Manager, Procurement Head, Quality Lead.

**Cycles**: Source → Make → Deliver → Enable (safety, compliance).

**Categories**: Logistics Disruptions | Supplier Risk | Manufacturing & Capacity | Safety & Compliance

---

## Requirements

**Output**: 4–6 Q&As, 200–300 words each, news-driven, cited.

**Coverage**: Address all 4 cycles; emphasize Logistics and Supplier Risk; engage multiple stakeholders.

**References**: Glossary, News sources (diverse, ≥3 types), valid URLs.

**Visuals**: ≥2 diagrams + ≥1 table.

## Execution

### 1. Discovery & Curation
**Search**: Find candidates from Supply Chain Dive, Logistics Mgmt, IndustryWeek, McKinsey, regulatory sites. Curate to cover multiple categories and meet criticality criteria.

**Record**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), domain, news title/source/date, summary, category, URL, criticality criterion.

### 2. Build References
**Glossary**: Define terms in plain language with analogies.

**Citations**: Use [Ref: N1][n1] inline; URLs at end.

### 3. Generate Q&A Structure
1. ### Qn: Question
2. #### News: What/when/why; cite source
3. #### Impact: Consequences across cycles, quantified
4. #### Stakeholders: Roles affected, concerns
5. #### Options & Decision: Alternatives, trade-offs, recommendation with timeline
6. #### Actions: Next steps, owners, key metrics
7. #### References: Links

### 4. Visuals
Add ≥2 diagrams (Mermaid: risk heatmap, decision tree, impact matrix) + ≥1 table.
