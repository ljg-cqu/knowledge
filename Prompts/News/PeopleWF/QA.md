## Execution

### Step 1: News Discovery

- Set generation date; calculate news age from it
- Web search (10–15 candidates):
  - Priority: Talent/hiring news <1 month
  - Include: Comp/policy <3 months, culture/wellbeing <12 months
- Sources: SHRM, HBR, LinkedIn, Gartner, Radford, Mercer, ILO, OECD, Gallup, McKinsey
- Filter: Meets freshness, decision criticality, has specific details, no rumors
- Select: 5–10 news items covering multiple categories and stakeholders

### Step 2: Build References

- **Glossary** (G#): Term + definition + analogy/example
- **News** (N#): Title + source + date + URL
- **Benchmarks** (B#): Metric + source
- **Laws** (L#): Regulation + jurisdiction
- **Research** (R#): Finding + source
- Citation format: `[Ref: N1][n1]`, footnote: `[n1]: URL`

### Step 3: Generate Q&A

Each Q&A (~150–250 words):
1. **News** (~30w): What/when/why/category/source/date
2. **Impact** (~60w): ≥2 lifecycle stages, quantified metrics, baselines/targets
3. **Stakeholders** (~40w): ≥2 roles, concerns/actions, perspectives
4. **Decision** (~40w): Primary path + alternatives with trade-offs, success criteria

### Step 4: Visuals

Include ≥2 visual aids:
- Diagrams: Mermaid flowcharts, decision matrices
- Tables: Comparisons, benchmarks, timelines

### Step 5: Validate

**Quantitative Checks**:
- Q&A count: 5–10
- Word count: 150–250 per Q&A
- Categories: ≥4 of 6 covered
- Stakeholders: ≥5 of 11 addressed
- Citations: 100% have ≥1
- Visuals: ≥2 total

**Qualitative Checks**:
