## III. Execution

### Step 1: News Discovery & Curation

**Record generation date (YYYY-MM-DD)**.

1. **Identify Domain**: Industry + operations focus (e.g., "Global Automotive Supply Chain Q1 2025").

2. **Web Search** (≥30–40 candidates, tiered):

   **Tier 1 – Disruptions/Incidents (1–7d)**  
   - `"[Domain] port congestion|shipment delay|backlog|trade disruption"`  
   - `"[Domain] freight rates|container prices|air cargo|rail disruption"`  
   - `"[Domain] plant shutdown|capacity cut|line stoppage"`  
   - `"[Key supplier] bankruptcy|insolvency|recall"`

   **Tier 2 – Process/Technology (7–30d)**  
   - Lean/OEE, automation, robotics, OT/IoT  
   - New warehouses, DCs, network redesigns

   **Tier 3 – Regulatory/Safety/Resilience (1–6mo)**  
   - Safety/environmental regulations, trade agreements, standards  
   - Resilience investments, nearshoring/reshoring

   **Source Whitelist**:  
   - **Industry/Trade**: Supply Chain Dive, Logistics Management, Modern Materials Handling, IndustryWeek  
   - **Logistics**: Maersk, DHL, UPS, FedEx blogs/reports  
   - **Manufacturing/Lean**: McKinsey Operations, BCG, Bain, TPS references  
   - **Regulatory**: OSHA, EPA, EU directives, local regulators  
   - **Research**: Gartner, SCM World, APICS, academic journals

3. **Curate & Validate** (≥20 items)  
   - Meets freshness/relevance criteria  
   - Includes quantitative details (lead times, capacity %, costs, incident rates)  
   - Avoids marketing without operational substance

4. **Verify Distribution**: Check category/age buckets; refine if thresholds not met.

5. **Allocate**: Map to 6 cycles, 6 categories, stakeholder roles.

### Step 2: Build References (before Q&A)

**Format**: G# (glossary), N# (news), L# (logistics metrics), M# (manufacturing/lean), S# (safety/regulatory), R# (research), A# (APA citations)

Use Markdown: `[Ref: N1][n1]` with `[n1]: URL` at end.

### Step 2.5: Opportunistic Refresh (optional)

Trigger only if **major disruption** (canal/port blockage, tier-1 supplier failure) or **regulatory shock** within 24–72h affecting ≥3 Q&As.

### Step 3: Generate Q&A (batch 3–4, self-check each)

**Question Patterns**:  
- "[Disruption] implications for [Cycles]/[Roles]?"  
- "[Supplier Event]+[Commodity Move]: sourcing strategy for [Region/Category]?"  
- "[Automation/OT]: impact on [Plant/Network] performance?"  
- "[Regulatory Change]: safety/compliance roadmap for [Operations]?"

**Answer Structure** (250–400w):
1. **News** (~60w): What, when, who, why, category `[Ref: N#]`  
2. **Impact** (~110w): ≥2 cycles + quantified metrics  
3. **Stakeholders** (~70w): ≥2 roles + concerns + actions + authority  
4. **Decision** (~90w): Adjust/Mitigate/Invest/Monitor/Exit + rationale + alternatives + success criteria  
5. **Action** (~60w): Immediate (0–2wks), short (2wks–2mo), medium (2–6mo) with owners  
6. **Projections** (optional ~40w): Scenario-based forecast with confidence

**Batch Self-Check**: News age, ≥2 cycles, ≥2 roles, decision, quantified metrics, citations, concrete actions.

### Step 4: Create Visuals

- **Flows**: Process maps, supply chain networks, value-stream maps  
- **Tables**: Capacity vs demand, lead times, costs, incident statistics  
- **Matrices**: Risk/impact grids, supplier segmentation, resilience options

### Step 5: Final Validation

- Validate floors (G, N, L, M, S, R, A, Q counts)  
- Verify category/role coverage, metrics, timelines, URL integrity  
- Complete validation table
