# Content Quality Check Guidelines

**Purpose:** Ensure content communicates clearly and comprehensively, supporting deep understanding, informed decisions, and meaningful action with minimal need for clarification.

**Application:** Apply comprehensively for high-impact, decision-critical, time-sensitive, multi-stakeholder, or effort-intensive content. Otherwise apply selectively.

## Guidelines

### Foundation

**1. Context**: State problem, scope, constraints, assumptions, scale, timeline, stakeholders, resources. ❌ Title only. ✅ Complete context.

**2. Clarity**: Define key terms and relationships; use diagrams for complexity. ❌ Unexplained jargon. ✅ Defined terms; diagrams.

**3. Precision**: Use exact metrics, formulas, units. ❌ Vague qualifiers ("fast", "soon"). ✅ Specific criteria (numbers, ranges, thresholds); formulas (`cost = base + (users × $0.10)`).

**4. Relevance**: Focus on essential information; move non-critical details to appendices. ❌ Unconnected background. ✅ Information supports purpose.

### Scope

**5. MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive): Ensure sections are distinct and comprehensive. ❌ Gaps/overlaps. ✅ Complete, non-overlapping coverage.

**6. Sufficiency**: Cover all dimensions (what, why, how, when, who, constraints, alternatives, risks, outcomes). ❌ Partial coverage. ✅ All dimensions addressed.

**7. Breadth**: Include relevant perspectives. ❌ Single viewpoint. ✅ Multiple perspectives.

**8. Depth**: Provide sufficient detail for high-impact areas. ❌ Principles without detail. ✅ Specifics (options, trade-offs, examples).

**8a. Difficulty Distribution** (Optional): For educational/knowledge content, balance skill levels. ❌ All advanced. ✅ Foundational (20%), Intermediate (40%), Advanced (40%) as baseline; adjust for audience.

### Quality

**9. Significance**: Highlight critical information; deemphasize low-impact details. ❌ Exhaustive low-relevance lists. ✅ Critical elements with references.

**10. Priority**: Order information by importance; label priority levels explicitly. ❌ Equal treatment of all information. ✅ Critical items first; priority indicators (critical/important/optional).

**11. Concision**: Eliminate redundancy. ❌ Repeated concepts. ✅ Each concept stated once, then referenced.

**12. Accuracy**: Verify facts against authoritative sources. ❌ Unverified claims. ✅ Verified facts; time-sensitive info flagged.

**13. Credibility**: Cite authoritative sources. ❌ Generic claims ("best practices say..."). ✅ Specific citations (source, standard, documentation).

**14. Logic**: Present coherent arguments with explicit trade-offs. ❌ One-sided claims. ✅ Balanced analysis with reasoning.

**15. Risk/Value**: Compare ≥2 alternatives with costs, benefits, risks. ❌ Single solution. ✅ Multiple options with trade-offs.

**16. Fairness**: Present balanced views and limitations. ❌ Single approach without downsides. ✅ Multiple perspectives; specify when NOT recommended.

### Format

**17. Structure**: Use clear headings, lists, tables, diagrams. ❌ Unstructured blocks. ✅ Organized headings, lists, tables, diagrams.

**18. Consistency**: Follow consistent hierarchy and conventions. ❌ Mixed formatting. ✅ Predictable structure (H1 title, H2 sections).

**19. TOC**: Include table of contents for long documents (>3 pages or >5 sections). ❌ No navigation aid. ✅ TOC with section links.

### Validation

**20. Evidence**: Include source details; flag uncertainty. ❌ Generic claims ("studies show..."). ✅ Specific citations (source, date, section); uncertainty flagged.

**21. Verification**: Perform structured self-review. ❌ No verification. ✅ Facts verified, contradictions checked, unknowns flagged.

**22. Practicality**: Include concrete steps, examples, tools. ❌ Abstract recommendations. ✅ Specific steps, examples, tools.

**23. Success Criteria**: Define measurable outcomes. ❌ Vague criteria ("better performance"). ✅ Specific targets (baseline, target, measurement).
