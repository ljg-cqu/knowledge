# Guidelines for LLM-Friendly Prompts with Multimedia Integration

Optimize prompts for high-quality, precise outputs with rich multimedia content.

## Guidelines

### Foundation: Define the Task

1. **Context**: State scope, constraints, assumptions, and multimedia requirements; specify whether content should be created or linked; define acceptable formats (images, audio, video) and quality standards.

2. **Clarity**: Request clear, understandable explanations; avoid jargon without definition; specify how multimedia should be integrated into responses and explain expected relationships between text and media.

3. **Precision**: Use specific terms; avoid ambiguity; maintain consistent terminology; define quality standards for different media types and use precise multimedia format specifications.

4. **Relevance**: Stay on topic; exclude tangential information; ensure multimedia elements directly support the core content and maintain focus on essential media references.

### Scope: What to Cover

5. **MECE**: Ensure complete, non-overlapping coverage; include comprehensive multimedia elements without redundancy; consider alternative formats for accessibility and provide fallback options.

6. **Sufficiency**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of all necessary aspects including visual, audio, and interactive elements; provide adequate metadata descriptions and sufficient context for media understanding.

7. **Breadth**: Request multiple perspectives where appropriate; consider different media types for the same concept; enable cross-referencing between media elements and allow alternative representations.

8. **Depth**: Request thorough treatment with sufficient detail; specify desired level of detail for media descriptions; include technical specifications where needed and define quality thresholds.

### Quality: Ensure Excellence

9. **Significance**: Prioritize important information and high-value multimedia elements; exclude trivial details and unnecessary media references; maintain relevance to core content.

10. **Concision**: Remove redundancy; include only essential information; optimize media placement and streamline integration points; minimize unnecessary descriptions.

11. **Accuracy**: Verify factual correctness; cross-check information and multimedia content accuracy; maintain consistent quality standards and flag uncertain media elements.

12. **Credibility & Reliability**: Prioritize authoritative, high-quality, tested sources; specify trusted multimedia repositories; avoid low-quality or unproven content; maintain consistent source evaluation criteria.

13. **Logic**: Demand coherent reasoning and sound structure; ensure logical relationships between text and multimedia elements; maintain consistent flow and clear connections.

14. **Risk/Value**: Assess risks, costs, and benefits; prioritize high-value, low-risk multimedia options; flag high-risk choices with mitigation strategies; consider technical limitations and compatibility.

15. **Fairness**: Request balanced perspectives; acknowledge assumptions, limitations, biases, alternatives, counterarguments, trade-offs, and misconceptions; ensure accessibility across different media types.

### Format: How to Present

16. **Structure**: Use lists, tables, diagrams, formulas, code blocks; organize multimedia elements logically; create clear relationships between media and text; use consistent formatting for media references.

17. **Output Format**: Request structured format with TOC linking to sections; include clear multimedia linking conventions; specify presentation requirements and define metadata standards for all media types.

### Multimedia Integration Specifications

18. **Content Creation**: When requesting generated content, specify:
    - Media type and format requirements
    - Quality parameters and technical specifications
    - Style guidelines and creative constraints
    - Integration points within the response

19. **Web-Sourced Content**: When requesting linked content, specify:
    - Search criteria and quality standards
    - Preferred source types and repositories
    - Credibility requirements and verification needs
    - Format compatibility and accessibility standards

20. **Media Optimization**: Request:
    - Appropriate media selection for content type
    - Efficient integration without redundancy
    - Cross-platform compatibility considerations
    - Alternative formats for accessibility compliance

### Validation: Ensure Correctness

21. **Evidence**: Cite credible sources for both text and multimedia content; flag uncertainty in media references; cross-reference multimedia content accuracy; document source reliability.

22. **Validation**: Request reasoning for media inclusion; include self-review of multimedia elements; perform error checks on media references; verify accessibility compliance and technical functionality.

23. **Practicality**: Ensure actionable, implementable guidance; consider technical limitations and platform compatibility; provide fallback options for unsupported formats; maintain usability across different devices.

24. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable, concrete outcomes; set quality standards for different media types; establish accessibility benchmarks; specify user experience requirements and engagement metrics.

### Implementation Notes

- **Model Compatibility**: Adapt guidelines based on LLM capabilities (text-only vs. multi-modal)
- **Resource Considerations**: Balance multimedia richness with computational efficiency
- **User Experience**: Prioritize accessibility and cross-platform compatibility
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement consistent evaluation criteria for all media types

These guidelines should be applied flexibly based on your specific use case, target audience, and the technical capabilities of your chosen LLM platform.
