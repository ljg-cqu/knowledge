# Extract Reflection Questions

## Task
Create reflection questions from source text that prompt metacognitive analysis of assumptions, mental models, connections, and implications.

## Definition
Each question identifies a key concept/claim/method and prompts introspection about understanding, assumptions, or application (e.g., "How does X change your understanding...", "What assumptions underlie...", "How would you apply X...").

## Rules
**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all concepts that challenge assumptions, connect to prior knowledge, or have significant implications
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source depth; do not skip sections

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all prompts in concepts explicitly stated or logically implied in source
- Never invent unrelated concepts or misrepresent content

**Focus:**
- Target metacognitive scenarios: assumptions challenged, mental model shifts, knowledge connections, application implications, belief updates

**Format:**
- **Question**: 1-2 sentences identifying concept + explicit reflection prompt about understanding/assumptions/implications
- **Answer**: 2-4 reflection points or guiding examples showing what thoughtful reflection might uncover
- Make each question self-contained with sufficient context

## Output
Markdown ordered list only:
1. Q: ... (concept reference + reflection prompt)
   A: ... (2-4 reflection points or examples)

## Instructions
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown will auto-number
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
