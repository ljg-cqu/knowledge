# Extract Reflection Questions

Task: From the source text, create **reflection questions** that are decision-critical and prompt metacognitive analysis of assumptions, mental models, connections, and implications for deep understanding and knowledge integration.

Definition:
- Each item identifies a key concept, claim, method, or principle from the text and asks the learner to examine their understanding, assumptions, or application.
- Questions prompt introspection: "How does X change your understanding of...", "What assumptions underlie...", "How would you apply X to...".
- Answers guide self-assessment with 2-4 specific reflection points or examples.

Rules:
- **Read the entire source text thoroughly**: Identify all decision-critical concepts that challenge assumptions, connect to prior knowledge, or have significant implications. Do not stop prematurely or skip sections.
- **Extract comprehensively**: Cover all decision-critical concepts where metacognitive reflection would deepen understanding. Generate sufficient questions to reflect the source's depth.
- **Maintain strict fidelity**: Ground all reflection prompts in concepts, principles, or claims explicitly stated or logically implied in the source. Never invent unrelated concepts or misrepresent source content.
- Focus on metacognitive scenarios: assumptions challenged, mental model shifts, knowledge connections, application implications, belief updates.
- Question: 1-2 sentences identifying concept/claim + explicit reflection prompt about understanding, assumptions, or implications.
- Answer: 2-4 reflection points or guiding examples showing what thoughtful reflection might uncover.
- Make each question self-contained with sufficient context from the source to enable meaningful reflection.

Output (Markdown ordered list only):
1. Q: ...  (concept reference + reflection prompt)
   A: ...  (2-4 reflection points or examples)

Instructions:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown will auto-number the list.
- Do not output any other text (no headings, comments, or explanations).
