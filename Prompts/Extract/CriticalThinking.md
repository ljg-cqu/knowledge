# Extract Critical Thinking Questions

## Task
Create critical thinking questions that evaluate arguments, evidence, logical reasoning, and claim validity from decision-critical content.

## Definition
Each question presents an argument, claim, or reasoning pattern and asks for analysis of its logical structure, evidence quality, or assumptions.

## Rules
**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all arguments, claims, causal statements, and reasoning chains
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source depth; do not skip sections

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all questions in arguments/claims explicitly stated or logically implied in source
- Never invent or misrepresent reasoning patterns

**Focus:**
- Argument structure: validity, soundness, strength
- Evidence quality: relevance, sufficiency, reliability
- Logical fallacies and flawed reasoning patterns
- Hidden assumptions and biased framing
- Distinguishing claims from facts, correlation from causation

**Format:**
- **Question**: 1-2 sentences presenting argument/claim/reasoning + explicit evaluation prompt
- **Answer**: 2-4 points identifying logical issues, assessing evidence quality, and explaining what would strengthen/weaken the argument
- Make each question self-contained with sufficient context

## Output
Markdown ordered list only:
1. Q: ... (argument/claim + critical analysis prompt)
   A: ... (evaluation covering logic, evidence, assumptions)

## Instructions
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown will auto-number
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
