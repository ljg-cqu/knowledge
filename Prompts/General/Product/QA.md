# Professional Q&A Generator

**Domain Adaptation Note**: This framework applies across industries—software, healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, consulting, etc. Adapt terminology, metrics, and examples to your specific context while maintaining the structural rigor and quality standards.

**Purpose**: Generate scenario-based questions for senior professional assessments across industries, focusing on judgment in decision-critical scenarios (significant impact, strategic shifts, major risks). Emphasize stakeholder navigation, trade-offs, strategic ambiguity.

**Scope**: Decision-critical scenarios across any domain; strategic, analytical, stakeholder-based, operational excellence.

**Scale**: 5-7 Q&As; 10-15min/question.

**Timeline**: Assessment (60-90min); immediate use.

**Stakeholders**: Domain-specific (adapt): executives, managers, specialists, finance, operations, external partners.

**Constraints**: 150-250 words/answer; ≥70% with citations; 100% decision-critical; senior level (5-15 years).

**Assumptions**: Industry/domain context provided or adapted; text output.

**Exclude**: Trivia, basic tasks, junior-level questions, narrow technical details.

**Success**: 80% elicit judgment, 70% assessment accuracy, ≥70% with citations, 100% high-impact scenarios; G≥6, T≥3, L≥3 (≥1 ZH), A≥5.

**Terms**:
- **Q&A**: Scenario pair testing judgment and expertise.
- **Floor**: Minimum threshold (≥ value = pass).
- **Quality Gate**: Mandatory checkpoint (fail = stop/fix).
- **Difficulty**: F=execution/implementation, I=strategy/trade-offs, A=portfolio/vision/P&L.
- **Dimensions**: Lenses (metrics, stakeholders, resources, risk, time, constraints).
- **Decision-Critical**: Meets ≥1: Blocks Decision (significant impact), Creates Risk (major consequences), Affects ≥2 Stakeholder Groups, Requires Action (actively evolving), Quantified Impact.

## Domain Adaptation Examples

Adapt topic areas to your domain:

**Software/Product**: Strategy & Prioritization, Metrics & Decision-Making, Stakeholder Alignment, GTM/Launch
**Healthcare**: Clinical Operations, Patient Outcomes & Analytics, Regulatory Compliance, Cross-Functional Coordination
**Finance**: Portfolio Strategy, Risk Management & Analytics, Client/Stakeholder Management, Market Positioning
**Manufacturing**: Operations & Supply Chain, Quality & Process Improvement, Stakeholder Coordination, Strategic Planning
**Education**: Curriculum & Program Development, Student Outcomes & Assessment, Stakeholder Engagement, Resource Allocation
**Consulting**: Client Strategy, Data-Driven Recommendations, Stakeholder Management, Project Delivery

Adapt terminology and metrics while preserving structure and rigor.

## Guidelines

### Quantitative Guidelines
- Q&A: 5-7 total, balanced difficulty, 150-250 words/answer, 70% with ≥1 citation, each ≥2 dimensions.
- Topics: Domain-adapted (examples): Strategy & Prioritization (2), Analytics & Decision-Making (2), Stakeholder Alignment (1), Domain-Specific Excellence (1).
- References: Glossary ≥6 terms, Tools ≥3, Literature ≥3 (≥1 ZH), Citations ≥5 APA 7th.
- Visuals: ≥1 diagram + table per topic.

### Citation Standards
- Format: APA 7th + language tag. Inline: [Ref: ID].
- Distribution: 50-70% EN, 20-40% ZH, 5-15% other.
- Types: ≥3 (frameworks, research, case studies, tools).

### Process
1. Plan: Identify domain context; select 5-7 Q&A across relevant topics, balanced difficulty.
2. Build References: Create glossary, tools, literature, citations tailored to domain. Check quality gates.
3. Generate Q&A: Scenario questions testing judgment in domain context. Answers with framework, dimensions, steps, trade-offs, communication, criteria, citations.
4. Create Visuals: ≥1 per topic, reference in answers.
5. Populate References: Format as specified.
6. Validate: Check floors, citations, criticality, domain relevance.
7. Final Review: Ensure clarity, realism, balance, cross-industry applicability.

### Quality Gates
Fail any = stop/fix:
1. Recency: 40% references from last 5 years.
2. Diversity: ≥3 citation types.
3. Evidence: Each topic ≥2 authoritative + ≥1 tool.
4. Tools: Include pricing, users, updates, integrations.
5. References: Accessible links.
6. Cross-refs: 100% resolve, consistent.

## Success Criteria
- Assessment Quality: 80% elicit judgment (baseline 50% trivia).
- Selection Accuracy: 70% show senior judgment in 6mo (baseline 40%).
- Citations: 70% answers with ≥1 citation.
- Impact: 100% scenarios with significant organizational/financial impact.

Target: Reduce selection risk by 60% via structured evaluations.

## Question Quality
Review each; rewrite if fails ≥2:
1. Clarity: Single ask (domain-adapted examples: "Prioritize retention vs. acquisition?", "Allocate budget across initiatives?").
2. Signal: Tests judgment (scenario-based, not hypothetical).
3. Depth: Enables trade-offs (alternatives with constraints).
4. Realism: Senior professional level (complex, multi-stakeholder constraints).
5. Discriminative: Application over recall (framework application vs. definition).
6. Alignment: Difficulty fits seniority (F execution/implementation, I trade-offs/strategy, A vision/P&L).

## Example

**Q1: How do you evaluate investing in a major initiative requested by top strategic partners (40% revenue) that conflicts with your organization's long-term strategic direction toward a broader market?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Strategy & Prioritization

**Key Insight**: Tests revenue protection (partner retention) vs. long-term strategic alignment (market expansion); distinguishes professionals navigating executive pressure from those defaulting to partner demands or rigid strategic adherence.

**Answer** (248 words):

Use multi-dimensional evaluation [Ref: A1]. **First, discover underlying needs** [Ref: A7]—what problem are partners solving? Surface requests often mask deeper needs revealing generalized solutions [Ref: A6].

**Second, quantify with decision framework** [Ref: G2]. Partner initiative: Impact (high retention/low acquisition), Resources (unknown if custom), Timeline (immediate). Broader market: Impact (medium/unit, high cumulative), Resources (similar), Timeline (longer). Frameworks alone won't capture strategic value—use weighted decision matrix [Ref: T2].

**Third, assess against strategic objectives** [Ref: G4]. Does this advance core goals or create operational debt [Ref: G9]? If generalized (partner-specific → scalable solution), both segments benefit and strengthen strategic position [Ref: G5].

**Trade-offs**: (1) Partner-specific: protects revenue but risks fragmentation/complexity; (2) Generalized solution: serves both but longer timeline/higher uncertainty; (3) Decline: maintains strategy but risks attrition/competitive loss; (4) Tiered approach: monetizes customization but adds operational overhead.

**Alternatives**: Professional services, partner ecosystem, modular configuration [Ref: L3].

**Stakeholder communication**: Present analysis with recommendation, trade-offs, criteria, precedent implications—strategic principles matter [Ref: T2].

**Success criteria**: If pursued, measure partner retention (+20%), broader market adoption (≥30% within 6mo), operational complexity (≤10% efficiency impact), support costs (flat/declining).

**Limitations**: Assumes partner needs are generalizable; may not apply if truly custom.

**Artifact**:

| Criterion           | Partner-Specific | Broader Market   | Weight | P Score | B Score |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue (12mo)      | $2M (retention)  | $500K (acquisition) | 30%  | 9       | 3       |
| Strategic alignment | Low (custom)     | High (vision)    | 25%    | 2       | 9       |
| Market reach        | 5 partners       | 5K+ prospects    | 20%    | 1       | 9       |
| Operational impact  | High (complex)   | Low (scalable)   | 15%    | 2       | 8       |
| Competitive advantage | Low (replicable) | High (differentiator) | 10% | 3    | 9       |
| **Weighted**        |                  |                  |        | **4.8** | **7.1** |

**Recommendation**: Generalized broader-market solution + partner premium services for edge cases.

**Confidence**: High (established frameworks; common strategic dilemma).
