# Value Assessment Q&A Generator

**Universal Cross-Industry Framework**: Adapted for ANY domain—not just software. Applies to manufacturing, healthcare, retail, logistics, education, finance, marketing, government, non-profit, research, consulting, hospitality, energy, agriculture, construction, real estate, media, and more.

Generate **4–8 decision-critical Q&As** for informed value decisions. Minimal viable scope: includes only questions that block decisions or create material risk.

**Universal Applicability**: This framework applies to ANY domain. The core principles (value assessment, stakeholder alignment, quantified decision-making) are domain-agnostic. The 6 value dimensions (business, user/customer, operational, organizational, strategic, risk) and structured decision-making approach work across all industries and organizational types. Customize terminology, stakeholders, lifecycle phases, and metrics to your specific context using the **Customization Guide** and **Industry-Specific Adaptations** sections below.

## Context

**Problem**: Poor value assessments lead to bad decisions (over-investing in low-ROI, underestimating operational debt, missing strategic opportunities). Structured Q&A evaluates value across 6 dimensions: business, user/customer, operational, organizational, strategic, risk.

**Scope**: Decision-critical scenarios (≥$100K impact or ≥20% efficiency change; adjustable to domain scale). Focus: Initiative/project lifecycle across ANY domain (planning, execution, delivery, operation)—applies to programs, campaigns, facilities, products, services, policies, processes, systems, and organizational changes.

**Constraints**: ~10–15min per Q&A; self-contained. **Assumptions**: Conflicting stakeholder priorities; context-dependent measurements. **Scale**: Individual to 50+ team decisions; 4-8 Q&A sets. **Timeline**: On-demand; 4-6h effort; refresh annually. **Stakeholders**: Domain-specific (e.g., Domain Lead/Manager, Operations, Finance, Subject Matter Expert, Executive, End-users/Customers). **Resources**: Capable LLM; optional online access.

**Terms**: Floor (min threshold ≥), Gate (fail-stop, 100% compliance), Difficulty (F=execution, I=strategy/trade-offs, A=portfolio/P&L), Value Types (Business, User/Customer, Operational, Organizational, Strategic, Risk—MECE), Decision Criticality (meets ≥1 criterion below).

**Limitations**: Balances conflicts; context-dependent; excludes speculation; customize for specific domains.

## Requirements

### Decision Criticality Framework (MANDATORY)

**Include if ≥1 criterion satisfied**: (1) **Blocks Decision** (investment go/no-go, resource allocation, strategic pivot), (2) **Creates Risk** (financial loss >10%, major opportunity cost, strategic misalignment, performance impact >20%), (3) **Affects ≥2 Core Roles** (Finance+Operations, Domain Lead+Executive, etc.), (4) **Requires Action** (1–6mo window, not speculative), (5) **Quantified Impact** (NPV, ROI, efficiency metrics, cost/benefit, adoption/utilization %).

**Exclude**: Niche/legacy (<5% adoption), orthogonal/nice-to-have, already covered, speculative.

### Floors (Minimum Thresholds)

## Example

**Q1: Operations proposes process improvement initiative ($800K, 9mo, 5 specialists). Domain Lead: timeline concerns. CFO: ROI justification. Operations: complexity +40%. Assess total value across lifecycle?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Phase**: Planning → Execution → Operation → Optimization (cross-lifecycle) | **Value Types**: Business, Operational, Organizational, Risk, Strategic | **Stakeholders**: Operations Lead, Domain Lead, CFO, Finance, Team Members

**Key Insight**: Comprehensive value assessment across lifecycle/stakeholders, balancing investment cost (negative) against distributed benefits (positive: operational/organizational/strategic) while navigating conflicting priorities.

**Answer** (~150 words):
Apply **Value Stream Mapping** [Ref: G7] + **Total Economic Impact** [Ref: A8]. **Multi-value**: Business [G1]: $800K+$120K/yr maintenance vs. $400K/yr efficiency gain, NPV (3yr, 10%): -$90K; Operational [G3]: process debt -$200K, scalability +$80K/yr; Organizational [G4]: autonomy +25%, capacity -30% ($270K cost); Risk [G6]: implementation risk $150K, resilience improves; Strategic [G5]: future capability expansion $500K/yr potential. **Stakeholders**: CFO: negative NPV; Operations: debt reduction; Domain Lead: timeline impact; Support: +2 FTE; Team: autonomy. **Lifecycle**: Planning (design) → Execution (opportunity cost) → Operation (efficiency) → Optimization (strategic gains). **Trade-offs**: Implement now (cost/gain), delay (compound inefficiency), phased (slower/lower risk). **Realization**: KPI metrics, costs, response time. **Limitations**: ±15% efficiency uncertainty; assumes capability; speculative expansion value.

**Communication**: CFO: NPV +$830K, breakeven mo 18 | Domain Lead: 3Q impact, 30% improvement after | Operations: debt -$200K, scalability | Support: +2 FTE, resilience [T4] | Team: autonomy. **Recommendation**: Approve with phased approach; $50K monitoring; 2 support FTE; quarterly tracking. **Confidence**: Medium (efficiency ±15%; future adoption uncertain).

## Customization Guide

### Adapting to Your Domain

**Step 1: Identify Domain Context**
- Industry/sector (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, government)
- Organization type (for-profit, non-profit, government, academic)
- Initiative scale (individual project, program, organizational change)
- Decision scope (department, organization, multi-stakeholder ecosystem)

**Step 2: Customize Terminology**
- Replace "PM/Product Manager" → Domain-specific role (e.g., Program Manager, Project Lead, Department Head, Clinical Lead)
- Replace "roadmap/velocity" → Domain metrics (e.g., production schedule, patient throughput, service delivery timeline)
- Replace "technical debt" → Domain debt (e.g., process inefficiency, maintenance backlog, capability gaps)
- Adapt lifecycle phases to your domain (see Industry-Specific Adaptations above)

**Step 3: Define Domain-Specific Stakeholders**
- **Core 4+**: Always include Finance, Operations, Domain Expert/Lead, Executive
- **Add relevant**: Compliance/Legal (regulated industries), Safety (manufacturing/construction), Clinical (healthcare), Student/Faculty (education), Beneficiaries (non-profit)

**Step 4: Identify Domain Value Types**
- **Keep universal**: Business (financial), Operational (efficiency), Organizational (people), Strategic (long-term), Risk (mitigation)
- **Customize User/Customer**: Patient (healthcare), Student (education), Citizen (government), Donor (non-profit), Guest (hospitality)
- **Add domain-specific**: Quality (manufacturing), Compliance (finance/healthcare), Safety (construction/manufacturing), Mission Impact (non-profit)

**Step 5: Select Domain Metrics**
| Domain | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Manufacturing** | OEE, Yield %, Cycle time | DPMO, Inventory turns, COGS |
| **Healthcare** | LOS, Readmission rate, HCAHPS | Cost per patient day, Staff ratios |
| **Retail** | Comp store sales, Inventory turns | Gross margin %, NPS, Conversion rate |
| **Education** | Graduation rate, Retention rate | Student-faculty ratio, Job placement % |
| **Finance** | AUM, NIM, ROI | CAC, NPL ratio, Compliance incidents |
| **Government** | Service coverage %, Cost per transaction | Response time, Constituent satisfaction % |
| **Non-Profit** | Beneficiaries served, Overhead ratio | Donor retention %, Months of reserves |
| **Hospitality** | RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy % | Guest satisfaction, Labor cost % |
| **Construction** | ROI, IRR, Schedule variance | Cost variance %, Safety incident rate |
| **Agriculture** | Yield per acre, Profit margin % | Water use efficiency, Sustainability index |

**Step 6: Adjust Decision Criticality Thresholds**
- **High-scale** (enterprise, government): ≥$1M impact, ≥25% performance change
- **Mid-scale** (typical): ≥$100K impact, ≥20% performance change
- **Small-scale** (SMB, department): ≥$25K impact, ≥15% performance change
- **Non-profit**: ≥10% beneficiary impact, ≥20% fundraising efficiency change

**Step 7: Tailor Literature/Citations**
- Search for domain-specific frameworks (e.g., Lean Six Sigma for manufacturing, Balanced Scorecard for healthcare, Theory of Change for non-profit)
- Include industry standards (e.g., ISO for manufacturing, HIPAA for healthcare, GAAP for finance)
- Reference domain thought leaders and recent research (≥50% from last 3 years)

**Step 8: Create Domain Examples**
- Use domain-typical initiatives (see Industry-Specific Adaptations section)
- Reference domain-familiar scenarios (equipment upgrade, system implementation, program launch)
- Include domain-specific constraints (regulatory approval, accreditation, seasonal factors)
