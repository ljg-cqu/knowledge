# Cross-Functional Collaboration Interview Q&A Generator

Generate 8-15 decision-critical Q&As on cross-functional collaboration for senior leadership interviews. Each must impact decisions, risk, stakeholders, or require near-term action.

**Audience**: Senior Managers, Directors, VPs, C-Suite Executives, Team Leaders, Project Managers, Product Owners, Department Heads across all industries (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing, Education, Consulting, Retail, Government, etc.)

**Context**: Teams 5-500+, potentially distributed/remote across timezones, multiple departments/functions, matrixed organizations.

**Scale**: 8-15 Q&As; 10-15min/question.

**Timeline**: Interview (60-90min) or training (2-4h workshop).

**Success**: Actionable insights with industry-appropriate frameworks (RACI/DACI, RAPID, Stage-Gate, Lean, Six Sigma, Agile) and quantified metrics (meeting efficiency %, decision velocity, stakeholder alignment, cycle time reduction).

# Core Requirements

## Question Specifications

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Count** | 8-15 (balanced across dimensions) |
| **Difficulty** | 30% F / 40% I / 30% A — **F**=Foundational (execution), **I**=Intermediate (strategy/trade-offs), **A**=Advanced (portfolio/vision) |
| **Answer Length** | 100-250 words: Context → Strategy → Framework → Metrics → Trade-offs |
| **Citations** | ≥1 per Q&A |
| **Artifacts** | Diagram, framework, table, metric per dimension |
| **Coverage** | Multiple phases and stakeholders; all decision-critical |

## Decision-Criticality Framework

**Include if ≥1 criterion satisfied**:
- **Blocks Decision**: Impacts roadmap, release planning, or resource allocation
- **Creates Risk**: Material threat (delivery delays, quality issues, compliance gaps)
- **Affects ≥2 Stakeholder Roles**: Multi-team impact
- **Requires Action**: 1-6mo implementation window (not theoretical)
- **Quantified Impact**: Measurable metrics (meeting time %, delivery velocity, collaboration efficiency)

**Exclude**: Niche, optional, redundant, or marketing-focused topics.

| Dimension | Criticality | Topics |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Decision-Making** | Blocks decisions | Decision frameworks (RAPID, RACI, consensus), escalation paths, conflict resolution, governance |
| **Communication** | Creates risk | Cross-functional communication, documentation standards, stakeholder management, information sharing |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Affects velocity | Onboarding, training, best practice sharing, institutional knowledge, skill development |
| **Coordination** | Blocks deliverables | Dependency management, handoffs, approvals, synchronization, resource allocation |

## Content Standards

- **Traceability**: Need → Strategy → Pattern → Mechanism → Metrics
- **Quantification**: Use specific numbers (e.g., "40% fewer meetings")
- **Context Awareness**: Consider team size, distribution, timezones
- **Balance**: ≥2 approaches with pros/cons table
- **Precision**: Define jargon; use concrete metrics

## Artifacts

| Cluster | Diagram | Framework | Metric |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Communication | Flow/Channel Map | DACI, Communication Charter, Stakeholder Matrix | Meeting Efficiency (%), Information Flow Time (days) |
| Decision-Making | Decision Tree | RAPID, RACI, Stage-Gate, Consensus Models | Decision Velocity (days), Escalation Rate (%) |
| Knowledge Transfer | Knowledge Map/Process Flow | Communities of Practice, Mentoring, Documentation Standards | Knowledge Retention (%), Onboarding Time (days) |
| Coordination | Dependency Graph/Gantt | Interface Agreements, Handoff Protocols, Resource Matrix | Cycle Time (days), Handoff Efficiency (%) |

**Format**: Mermaid diagram + framework + table (≥2 approaches: Pros/Cons/When) + metric per dimension.

**Frameworks**: RACI/DACI/RAPID, Stage-Gate, Lean/Six Sigma, Agile/Scrum, Cynefin, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard, PMBOK, PRINCE2, Design Thinking

## Lifecycle-Stakeholder Coverage

| Initiation/Planning | Alignment, requirements, scope definition | Project Manager, Business Analyst, Sponsor, Finance, Legal |
| Design/Strategy | Solution design, resource planning, approvals | Subject Matter Experts, Architects/Designers, Compliance, Risk Management |
| Execution/Implementation | Delivery, coordination, quality control | Implementation Teams, Quality Assurance, Vendors/Suppliers, Operations |

# Generation Process

1. **Plan and Gather**: Ensure 8-15 Q&As across dimensions, balanced difficulty, covering ≥5 phases/≥6 stakeholders. Compile references meeting minimums and quality criteria.
2. **Create Q&As**: Write answers with structure, citations, quantification, approaches table, lifecycle links. Provide artifacts per dimension.
3. **Validate**: Verify counts, citations, recency, criticality, frameworks, metrics, artifacts, coverage. Fix issues.
