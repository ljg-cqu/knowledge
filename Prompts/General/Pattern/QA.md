# Pattern-Based Q&A Generation Template

## Overview

Generate 8-12 decision-critical Q&As for professional patterns across 4-6 MECE domains in any industry or discipline.

**Scale**: 8-12 Q&As; 10-15min/question.

**Timeline**: Interview (90-120min) or self-study; immediate use.

**Stakeholders**: Professionals, Specialists, Managers, Leaders, Subject Matter Experts, Analysts, Practitioners across all industries.

**Output**: Concise answers with ≥12 glossary terms, ≥6 tools/methods/frameworks, ≥6 literature sources, ≥8 citations.

**Success**: All criteria pass, 100% decision-critical, ≥80% with Tier 1-2 citations.

**Key Terms**:
- **F/I/A**: **F**=Foundational (execution), **I**=Intermediate (strategy/trade-offs), **A**=Advanced (portfolio/vision)
- **MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- **RFC 2119**: MUST/SHOULD/MAY
- **Decision Criticality**: Patterns blocking decisions, creating risk, affecting ≥2 roles, evolving, or with high adoption barriers

## Requirements
- **Q&As**: 8-12 total (2F/4I/2-6A; concise)
- **References**: ≥12 glossary terms, ≥6 tools/methods/frameworks, ≥6 literature sources, ≥8 citations
- **Domains**: 4-6 decision-critical (MECE)
- **Patterns**: 8-12 across domains
- **Validation**: All criteria pass; 100% patterns meet ≥1 criticality criterion; critical claims cited with Tier 1-2 sources; MECE domains; accessible links

## Decision-Criticality Framework
**Include if ≥1 criterion satisfied**:
- **Blocks Decision**: Strategic, operational, tactical, investment, or policy choices
- **Creates Risk**: Material threat (operational, financial, legal, reputational, safety issues)
- **Affects ≥2 Stakeholder Roles**: Multi-functional impact
- **Requires Action**: 1-18mo implementation window (actively evolving)
- **Quantified Impact**: Measurable metrics (adoption barrier >40h effort, efficiency %, ROI, cost impact)

**Exclude if**:
- Niche/legacy (<5% adoption)
- Nice-to-have (no decision impact)
- Already covered

## Content Guidelines
### Pattern Quality
1. Reusability: ≥2 contexts
2. Effectiveness: ≥1 company, ≥1 metric [Ref: ID]
3. Boundaries: "Applies when" + "Avoid when"
4. Stakeholders: ≥2 groups
5. Trade-offs: ≥1 benefit, ≥1 cost
6. Anti-patterns: ≥1 failure mode

### Answer Structure (5-Step)
1. Claim
2. Rationale
3. Evidence [Ref: ID]
4. Implications (≥2 stakeholders)
5. Trade-offs & Boundaries

### Evidence Standards
**Tiers** (prioritize 1-2):
1. Peer-reviewed/standards/regulations
2. Vendor docs/authoritative books
3. Org blogs/analyst reports
4. Expert blogs/conferences/OSS
5. Forums

**Citations**:
- Critical: ≥1 Tier 1-2, SHOULD ≥2 sources
- Supporting: ≥1 for non-obvious
- Recency: <3yr (fast-moving), <10yr (stable)
- Format: Author/Org (Year). _Title_. URL/DOI [Lang]. Inline: [Ref: ID]

### Best Practices
- Use 5-step template
- Justify criticality
- Cite claims (Tier 1-2)
- ≥2 perspectives
- Explicit boundaries/trade-offs
- Examples (case studies/diagrams/models)
- RFC 2119 terms
- Prioritize high-impact

**Prohibited**: Vague language, Tier 5 for critical claims, omitting anti-patterns, universal claims, dead links, unsubstantiated claims, non-critical patterns
