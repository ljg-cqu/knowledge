Given the topic word `{topic}`, generate a focused, comprehensive vocabulary pack by creating nine Markdown files in `/home/zealy/nas/github/ljg-cqu/knowledge/Vocabulary/{topic}`. Each file corresponds to one prompt in `/home/zealy/nas/github/ljg-cqu/knowledge/Prompts/Vocabulary`. Read and understand each prompt file, then apply its guidelines to generate final concrete content specialized for `{topic}`. The output must be complete, ready-to-use vocabulary files with actual topic-specific content, not templates.
