# Register & Formality for Natural English

**Type**: Reference guide AND standalone post-check tool

**Modes**: 
- **Formal Mode (Elevation)**: Casual → Professional/Academic
- **Casual Mode (Naturalization)**: Over-formal → Conversational (default)

**Task**: Calibrate English content to appropriate register—elevate informal drafts OR naturalize over-formal text.

**Definition**: Systematically adjust word choice, phrasing, and tone to match formality expectations while maintaining natural, accessible language.

---

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Register adjustment enhances appropriateness without changing meaning or facts. Preserve accuracy over fluency.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all semantic content
- Match formality to context (academic ≠ email ≠ chat)
- Balance professionalism with readability
- Avoid over-formality (pretentious) and over-informality (unprofessional)

**Example**:
```
✗ We got the system working real good after we fixed a bunch of stuff.
✓ We successfully stabilized the system after addressing several issues.
```

## Formality Spectrum

**Framework**: Match register to context

```
FORMALITY LEVELS (informal → formal)

[Chat/Slack]
   get, find out, a lot of, really good, can't, I think
   
[Professional Email/Documentation]  
   obtain, determine, many, quite effective, cannot, we found
   
[Technical Report]
   acquire, ascertain, numerous, notably effective, is unable to, this study examines
   
[Academic Publication]
   procure, establish, substantial, significantly effective, does not, evidence demonstrates

[Legal] — Usually too formal for technical writing, avoid
```

**Context Examples**:
```
Chat:      "We can't get it working. Let's find out why."
Email:     "We cannot stabilize it yet. We're determining the cause."
Report:    "The system remains unstable. We are investigating root causes."
Academic:  "System stability has not been achieved. This study examines underlying factors."
```

**Common Mistakes**:
```
✗ Too informal:   "We'll check out how caching works."
✓ Appropriate:    "We examine how caching mechanisms operate."

✗ Over-formal:    "We shall endeavor to ascertain the verity of the assertion."
✓ Professional:   "We will verify the validity of this claim."
```

I'm, you're, they're → I am, you are, they are
```

**Context**:
```
Academic/Report: Never use contractions
Email: Acceptable if less formal
Chat/Slack: Standard and natural
```

**Common Errors**:
```
✗ it's [possessive - wrong]

Traditional (older): Passive voice preferred

✓ Modern: "We found that caching improves performance."
✓ Formal: "This study found that caching improves performance."
✓ Passive: "Caching was found to improve performance."

✗ Overuse: "I think, I believe, I feel" [too subjective]
✓ Better: "This paper argues, Evidence suggests" [authoritative]
```

**Second Person (you) — Avoid in Academic**:
```
✗ Academic: "You can optimize by adding indexes."
✓ Academic: "Systems can be optimized by adding indexes."

✓ Documentation: "You can configure caching by..." [acceptable - instructional]
```

**Usage**:
```
✗ I think caching is good. You should use it.

✗ Overuse: "We conducted research. We analyzed data. We found that..."
✓ Varied: "We conducted research and analyzed data. Results indicate that..."
```

---

## VI. Latin Abbreviations

[← Quick Reference #6 | Priority: P2 | 60% usage]

**Correct Usage**:

```
E.G. (for example):
✓ In parentheses: Several languages (e.g., Python, Java) are suitable.
✗ Main text: Use "for example" instead
✓ Always with comma: e.g., X, Y, Z

I.E. (that is):
✓ In parentheses: NoSQL databases (i.e., MongoDB, Redis) were tested.
✗ Main text: Use "that is" or "namely" instead
✓ Always with comma: i.e., specific clarification

ET AL. (and others):
✓ Citations: Smith et al. (2023) demonstrated...
✓ For 3+ authors after first citation
✓ No comma: Smith et al. [not Smith, et al.]

ETC. (and so forth):
✓ Use sparingly: Factors include latency, throughput, etc.
✗ Don't combine with "and": ✗ Python, Java, and etc. [redundant]
```

**Common Errors**:
```
✗ eg (missing periods/comma)
✓ e.g., (correct)

✗ e.g. confused with i.e.
✓ e.g., = "for example" (illustrative)
✓ i.e., = "that is" (specific clarification)

✗ Smith, et al. (comma before)
✓ Smith et al. (no comma)
```

---

## VII. Nominalizations

[← Quick Reference #7 | Priority: P2 | 55% usage]

**Definition**: Converting verbs to nouns (often -tion, -ment, -ance, -ence)

**When Appropriate**:
```
✓ Technical terms: implementation, optimization, configuration
✓ Established concepts: performance, scalability, throughput
✓ Abstract references: "The implementation was successful."
```

**Avoid Over-Nominalization**:
```
✗ Over-nominalized: "The implementation of the optimization resulted in the improvement of performance."
✓ With verbs: "Implementing optimization improved performance."
✓ Clearest: "Optimization improved performance."

✗ "The analysis of data led to the identification of problems."
✓ "Analyzing data identified problems."
✓ "Data analysis identified problems." [balanced]
```

**Balance Principle**:
```
✓ Use for: Established technical terms, abstract concept references
✗ Avoid: Chains of prepositional phrases, unnecessary complexity

✓ Balanced: "System optimization improves performance and reduces latency."
✗ Over-nominalized: "The optimization of the system results in the improvement of performance and the reduction of latency."
```

---

## VIII. Casualization Patterns (Reverse Mode)

[Priority: Context-dependent | Casual Mode only]

**Use when**: Making over-formal text conversational (team chat, informal emails)

**Warning**: When in doubt, stay formal.

### Core Reverse Patterns

**Contractions (Formalization Reversal)**:
```
Formal → Casual

cannot, will not, do not → can't, won't, don't
it is, that is, there is → it's, that's, there's
we have, I would, they are → we've, I'd, they're

Example:
✗ Over-formal: "We cannot proceed until we have verified all parameters. It is essential."
✓ Casual: "We can't proceed until we've verified all parameters. It's essential."
```

**Verbs (Simplification)**:
```
Formal → Casual

obtain, acquire → get
determine, ascertain → find out, figure out
examine, analyze → look at, check out
conduct, perform → do, run
implement, effect → make
demonstrate, present → show
facilitate, enhance → help, improve

Example:
✗ Over-formal: "We obtained the results and determined that the system performs adequately."
✓ Casual: "We got the results and found out that the system works fine."
```

**Quantifiers (Natural Language)**:
```
Formal → Casual

numerous, substantial → a lot of, lots of, many
several, multiple → some, a few, a bunch of
considerably, significantly → really, pretty, very
somewhat, rather → kind of, sort of

Example:
✗ Over-formal: "We identified numerous issues. Performance improved substantially."
✓ Casual: "We found a lot of issues. Performance improved a lot."
```

**Academic to Conversational**:
```
Formal → Casual

This study examines → We're looking at
Evidence suggests → It looks like
Results indicate → Turns out
It is evident that → Clearly / Obviously
The system demonstrates → The system shows / works

Example:
✗ Over-formal: "This analysis indicates that caching substantially improves performance."
✓ Casual: "Our analysis shows caching really helps with performance."
```

### Casualization Priority

**P0**: Add contractions, simplify verbs (obtain → get, determine → find out)

**P1**: Natural quantifiers (numerous → a lot of), phrasal verbs (examine → look at), personal pronouns

**P2**: Casual intensifiers (significantly → really), relaxed phrasing

### Casualization Guidelines

**Safe to casualize:**
```
✓ Team Slack/chat
✓ Internal emails (peer-level)
✓ Brainstorming docs
✓ Informal project updates
✓ 1-on-1 messages
```

**Avoid casualizing:**
```
✗ Academic papers
✗ Technical reports (external)
✗ Client-facing emails
✗ Documentation (official)
✗ Upward communication (to management/executives)
✗ Legal/compliance documents
```

**Gray areas (use judgment):**
```
⚠ Professional emails (depends on relationship, company culture)
⚠ Internal documentation (depends on team norms)
⚠ Cross-team communication (depends on formality expectations)
```

### Casualization Example

```
BEFORE (Over-formal for team chat):
"We conducted comprehensive testing of the caching implementation and determined that Redis demonstrates superior performance compared to Memcached. Results indicate a substantial improvement in latency—specifically, a 40% reduction. We recommend proceeding with deployment."

AFTER (Appropriate casual):
"We've tested the caching setup and found out Redis is way better than Memcached. Latency's down by 40%—really solid improvement. Let's go ahead with deployment."

CONTEXT: Team Slack conversation
```

---

## IX. Context Calibration

**Formality by Context**:

```
ACADEMIC PAPER (Highest):
✓ Formal verbs: conduct, examine, demonstrate
✓ No contractions: cannot, do not
✓ No phrasal verbs: determine (not "find out")
✓ Precise quantifiers: numerous, substantial
✓ Latin abbreviations in parentheses
✓ Limited first person: "We examine..." acceptable

Example: "This study examines distributed caching strategies. We conducted experiments evaluating Redis and Memcached. Results demonstrate that Redis achieves 30% lower latency under high load."

TECHNICAL REPORT (High-Medium):
✓ Professional verbs: use, implement, analyze
✓ Avoid contractions
✓ Some phrasal verbs OK: "set up," "boot up" (technical)
✓ Clear quantifiers: many, several
✓ First person acceptable: "We recommend..."

Example: "This document describes our caching implementation. We use Redis for session storage. Tests show Redis performs well under high load, achieving 30% lower latency."

PROFESSIONAL EMAIL (Medium):
✓ Readable: use, check, help
✓ Contractions acceptable (less formal)
✓ Phrasal verbs acceptable: "find out," "look into"
✓ Natural: several, a few
✓ First person common: "I think," "We found"

Example: "We've been testing Redis for caching. Initial results look promising—latency is about 30% lower. I'll share detailed findings next week."

TEAM CHAT (Low):
✓ Informal: get, check, find
✓ Contractions standard: can't, won't, it's
✓ Phrasal verbs natural: "figure out," "look at"
✓ Casual: a lot, a bit
✓ Conversational

Example: "Redis is working really well. Latency's way down—like 30% better. Can't wait to deploy this."
```

---

## Application Guidelines

**Steps**:
1. Select mode: Formal or Casual
2. Identify context (paper / report / email / chat)
3. Apply transformations: P0 → P1 → P2
4. Preserve semantic content

**Common Pitfalls**:
```
Over-formality: "We shall endeavor to ascertain optimal parameters."
→ Formal: "We will determine optimal parameters."
→ Casual: "We'll figure out the best settings."

Under-formality: "We're gonna check out the system and figure out what's up."
→ Formal: "We will investigate the system to diagnose the issue."
→ Casual: "We'll check the system and figure out what's wrong."

Inconsistency: "This study examines... We're gonna test... Results are pretty good."
→ Formal: "This study examines... We test... Results are promising."
→ Casual: "We're looking at... We're gonna test... Results look pretty good."
```

**Quality Checks**: ✓ Mode appropriate? ✓ Register consistent? ✓ Meaning preserved?

---

## Comprehensive Examples

**Example 1: Academic Register Elevation (P0+P1+P2)**
```
✗ Nowadays, lots of systems can't handle big loads. We're gonna look at caching stuff and figure out if it really helps. It's kind of like a must-have thing these days. We checked out Redis and found out it's way better. The results are pretty good and show tons of improvement.

✓ Currently, numerous systems cannot handle high load effectively. This study examines caching strategies to determine their impact on performance. Caching has become essential in modern system design. We evaluated Redis and determined that it demonstrates superior performance. Results are promising, indicating substantial improvement—specifically, 40% latency reduction under high-load conditions.

[Fixed: contractions, informal verbs, vague quantifiers, colloquialisms; added quantification]
```

**Example 2: Context-Appropriate Register (Formal Mode)**
```
Chat:     "We've been checking out Redis. It's way faster than what we had. Gonna deploy it next week."
Email:    "We've evaluated Redis for caching. It performs significantly better than our current solution. We plan to deploy next week."
Report:   "We evaluated Redis as a caching solution. Benchmarks demonstrate 40% performance improvement over the existing system. Deployment is scheduled for next week."
Academic: "This study evaluated Redis for distributed caching. Empirical results demonstrate 40% latency reduction compared to the baseline system."
```

**Example 3: Casualization (Casual Mode)**
```
✗ Over-formal (for team chat):
"We conducted an extensive evaluation of the Redis implementation. Results indicate that performance has improved substantially—specifically, latency has been reduced by approximately 40%. We recommend proceeding with the deployment process in the forthcoming week."

✓ Appropriate casual:
"We've tested Redis pretty thoroughly. Performance is way better—latency's down by about 40%. Let's deploy it next week."

[Fixed: Added contractions, simplified verbs (conducted→tested, indicate→is), casualized quantifiers (substantially→way), relaxed phrasing]
```
