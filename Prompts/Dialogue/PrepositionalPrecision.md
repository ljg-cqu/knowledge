# Prepositional Precision for Natural English
*Last Updated: 2025-11-24 | Status: Reviewed | Owner: Documentation Team*

**Type**: Dual-purpose - Supporting reference AND standalone post-check/improvement tool

**Purpose**: Reference guide and post-check tool for precise, natural preposition usage—eliminates errors, reduces verbosity, improves fluency.

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Enhance **clarity and naturalness** without changing **meaning or facts**—preserve all semantic content, never add or alter information.

**Conflict Resolution**: When fluency enhancements conflict with factual accuracy, always preserve accuracy.

**Example**:
```
Before: We need to have a discussion regarding the matter of database optimization.
After:  We need to discuss database optimization.
[Same meaning, more concise with correct preposition usage]
```

## Priority System

**Universal application order:**

- **P0 (Must fix)**: Fixed collocations (Quick Ref #9-11), spatial/temporal errors (#1-2)
  - Wrong collocations cause grammatical errors
  - Examples: ~~depends of~~ → depends on, ~~in Monday~~ → on Monday
  
- **P1 (High value)**: Conciseness (#8), redundant prepositions (#12)
  - Verbose phrases reduce clarity
  - Examples: ~~in terms of~~ → (omit), ~~where...at~~ → where

- **P2 (Polish)**: Direction/abstract (#3-7), idioms (#13-15)
  - Improves naturalness and fluency
  - Examples: toward vs to, *on time* vs *in time*

**Application**: Fix P0 first (correctness), then P1 (clarity), then P2 (polish)

## Standalone Usage: Post-Check Workflow

**Mode 1: Reference During Writing** — Use Quick Reference and Cheat Sheet while drafting

**Mode 2: Post-Check After Writing** — Audit completed content systematically

### Review Workflow

**Step 1: Scan** — Identify errors by priority [→ Priority System]
- **P0 check (correctness)**: Fixed collocations, spatial/temporal
  - Scan for: verb+prep, adj+prep, noun+prep, time/date, location
  - Tools: Cheat Sheet (20 top errors), Quick Reference table, Decision Tree
- **P1 check (clarity)**: Verbose phrases, redundant prepositions, transitive verbs
  - Scan for: "in terms of", "where...at", "discuss about"
  - Tools: Section VII patterns
- **P2 check (polish)**: Direction, idioms, naturalness
  - Scan for: to/toward distinction, fixed expressions
  - Tools: Sections III, VI

**Step 2: Fix** — Apply corrections using patterns
- Replace errors with correct forms from Quick Reference
- Simplify verbose phrases using Section VII
- Remove redundant/unnecessary prepositions
- Preserve all semantic content

**Step 3: Validate** — Quality checks before finalization
- ✓ Semantic content preserved?
- ✓ More concise and natural?
- ✓ Grammatically correct?
- ✓ Read aloud for fluency

### Quick Diagnostic Questions
- Are there verb/adj/noun + preposition combinations? → Check Section V
- Are there time or location references? → Check Sections I, II
- Are there phrases like "in terms of" or "where...at"? → Check Section VII
- Does it sound unnatural or wordy? → Check Priority System

**→ For pattern details and comprehensive reference, continue to Sections I-VII below.**

## Pattern Selection Guide (Decision Tree)

**Use this to quickly identify which pattern applies:**

```
START: Identify the error type
│
├─ Is it a VERB + preposition? (e.g., "depends of")
│  └─ → Use Section V: Verb+Prep Collocations (P0)
│     Examples: depend on, consist of, listen to, focus on
│
├─ Is it an ADJECTIVE + preposition? (e.g., "good in")
│  └─ → Use Section V: Adj+Prep Collocations (P0)
│     Examples: good at, interested in, different from
│
├─ Is it a NOUN + preposition? (e.g., "solution of")
│  └─ → Use Section V: Noun+Prep Collocations (P0)
│     Examples: solution to, impact on, reason for
│
├─ Is it about LOCATION/PLACE? (e.g., "in the door")
│  └─ → Use Section I: Spatial Prepositions (P0)
│     Rule: at (point), on (surface), in (enclosed)
│
├─ Is it about TIME/DATE? (e.g., "in Monday")
│  └─ → Use Section II: Temporal Prepositions (P0)
│     Rule: at (time), on (day/date), in (period)
│
├─ Is it a VERBOSE phrase? (e.g., "in terms of")
│  └─ → Use Section VII: Efficiency Patterns (P1)
│     Action: Omit or rephrase for conciseness
│
├─ Is it a REDUNDANT preposition? (e.g., "where...at")
│  └─ → Use Section VII: Redundancy Patterns (P1)
│     Action: Remove unnecessary preposition
│
├─ Is the verb TRANSITIVE? (e.g., "discuss about")
│  └─ → Use Section VII: Transitive Verbs (P1)
│     Action: Remove preposition entirely
│
├─ Is it a FIXED EXPRESSION? (e.g., "on time" vs "in time")
│  └─ → Use Section VI: Idiomatic Expressions (P2)
│     Action: Memorize the fixed form
│
└─ Is it about MOVEMENT/DIRECTION? (e.g., "go toward" vs "go to")
   └─ → Use Section III: Directional Prepositions (P2)
      Rule: to (destination), toward (direction), into (entering)
```

## Comprehensive Patterns (Advanced Reference)

**→ 80% of use cases covered above. Continue only if needed for edge cases.**

**Structure**: Two approaches (use both for complete mastery)

### Approach 1: By Pattern Logic (Why/How)
- **I. Spatial** (90%): Rules for at/on/in with location
- **II. Temporal** (85%): Rules for at/on/in with time
- **III. Directional** (70%): Rules for movement prepositions
- **IV. Abstract** (75%): Rules for concept prepositions

### Approach 2: By Word Type (What to Fix - Most Practical)
- **V. Fixed Collocations** (80%): Memorized verb/adj/noun + prep pairs
  - This section covers most errors (Verb+Prep, Adj+Prep, Noun+Prep)
  - Sections I-IV explain the logic; Section V provides quick lookup

### Special Cases
- **VI. Idiomatic Expressions** (60%): Fixed phrases requiring memorization
- **VII. Efficiency Patterns** (70%): Eliminating verbose/redundant prepositions

**Recommendation**: Start with Section V (Fixed Collocations) for fastest results, then consult I-IV for understanding edge cases.

---

## I. Spatial Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #1 | Priority: P0]

**Core Patterns** (90% usage):
- **at** (point): *at the door, at 123 Main St, at the conference, at school*
- **on** (surface): *on the table, on the bus, on Elm Street, on the screen*
- **in** (enclosed): *in the room, in Tokyo, in the database, in the system*

**Key Distinction**: at = point, on = surface/line, in = 3D enclosure
```
✓ at the station (point) | on the table (surface) | in Tokyo (area)
✗ in the station (unless inside building)
```

**Advanced Distinctions**:
- **between** (2 items) vs **among** (3+ items)
- **above** (higher, no contact) vs **over** (covering/spanning)
- **below** (lower) vs **under** (directly beneath)

---

## II. Temporal Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #2 | Priority: P0]

**Core Patterns** (85% usage):
- **at** (specific time): *at 3 PM, at noon, at the moment, at 25 (age), **at night***
- **on** (days/dates): *on Monday, on July 4th, on my birthday, on Monday morning*
- **in** (longer periods): *in 2024, in January, in summer, in the morning, in two hours*

**Key Distinction**: at = point in time, on = day/date, in = period/future duration
```
✓ at 9 AM | on Friday | in March | **at night** (exception)
✗ in 9 AM | in Friday | on March
```

**Duration/Deadline**:
- **for** (how long): *for two hours*
- **during** (when): *during the meeting*
- **since** (start point): *since 2019*
- **by** (deadline): *by Friday*
- **until** (continuing): *until 6 PM*

---

## III. Directional Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #3 | Priority: P2]

**Core Patterns** (70% usage):
- **to** (destination/target): *go to the office, send to client, from 1 to 10*
- **toward** (direction, not arrival): *walk toward the exit, moving toward a solution*
- **into** (entering/transformation): *step into the room, turn into ice, translate into Chinese*
- **from** (origin/source): *come from, stem from research, from 9 to 5*
- **through** (passage/means): *drive through tunnel, learn through practice*

**Key Distinction**: to = reaching destination, toward = moving in direction, into = entering
```
✓ go to the office | walk toward the door | step into the room | come from Tokyo
✗ go at the office | walk to the door (if not arriving)
```

---

## IV. Abstract Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #4-7 | Priority: P2]

**Purpose**: Understand semantic meaning to handle non-collocation cases. For fixed verb/adj/noun+prep pairs, see Section V.

**Semantic Patterns** (75% usage):
- **about** (topic/approximate): General topic, rough quantity
  - *talk/think/worry about*, *about $100* (approximate)
- **on** (formal topic/focus): Specific focus, formal subject matter
  - *lecture/presentation/paper on*, *focus/concentrate on*
- **of** (belonging/composition/origin): Possession, part-whole, source
  - *CEO of company*, *consist/composed of*, *matter of time*
- **for** (purpose/beneficiary/duration): Goal, recipient, time span
  - *designed/built for*, *work for company*, *for two hours*
- **with** (accompaniment/tool/manner): Association, instrument, method
  - *work with team*, *build with Python*, *agree/consistent with*

**When to Use**:
- Choosing between prepositions with similar meanings
- Understanding why certain collocations exist
- Handling new combinations not in Section V

```
✓ talk about the project (general topic) | lecture on AI (formal topic)
✓ consists of modules (composition) | designed for testing (purpose)
✗ focus at → focus on (wrong preposition for focus/concentration)
```

**Note**: Many abstract prepositions form fixed collocations (see Section V). This section explains the logic; Section V provides the complete list.

## Examples with Pattern Analysis

**Example 1: Collocation Errors (P0 - Must Fix)**
```
✗ The meeting starts in Monday. We'll discuss about features. The team is good in React.
```

**Analysis**:
- "in Monday" → **Temporal error** (Section II): Days use "on" → "on Monday"
- "discuss about" → **Transitive verb** (Section VII-C): No preposition needed → "discuss"
- "good in" → **Adj+Prep collocation** (Section V): Correct form → "good at"

```
✓ The meeting starts on Monday. We'll discuss features. The team is good at React.
```

---

**Example 2: Conciseness (P1 - High Value)**
```
✗ In terms of performance, the system is slow due to the fact that we have many queries.
```

**Analysis**:
- "In terms of performance" → **Verbose phrase** (Section VII-A): Omit → "The system performs poorly..."
- "due to the fact that" → **Verbose phrase** (Section VII-A): Replace → "because"

```
✓ The system performs poorly because we have many queries.
```

---

**Example 3: Comprehensive (All Priorities)**
```
✗ We need to discuss about the solution of this problem. The issue is different than expected. 
In the event of failure, retry. Where's the file at? Success depends of many factors.
```

**Analysis**:
- "discuss about" → **Transitive verb** (Section VII-C, P1): Remove prep → "discuss"
- "solution of" → **Noun+Prep collocation** (Section V, P0): Correct form → "solution to"
- "different than" → **Adj+Prep collocation** (Section V, P0): US standard → "different from"
- "In the event of" → **Verbose phrase** (Section VII-A, P1): Replace → "If"
- "Where's the file at?" → **Redundant preposition** (Section VII-B, P1): Remove → "Where's the file?"
- "depends of" → **Verb+Prep collocation** (Section V, P0): Correct form → "depends on"

```
✓ We need to discuss the solution to this problem. The issue differs from what we expected. 
If it fails, retry. Where's the file? Success depends on many factors.
```

**6 errors fixed**: 4 P0 (collocations), 2 P1 (verbose/redundant)
