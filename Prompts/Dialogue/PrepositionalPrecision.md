# Prepositional Precision for Natural English

**Purpose**: Reference guide and post-check tool for precise, natural preposition usage—eliminates errors, reduces verbosity, improves fluency.

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Enhance **clarity and naturalness** without changing **meaning or facts**—preserve all semantic content, never add or alter information.

**Conflict Resolution**: When fluency enhancements conflict with factual accuracy, always preserve accuracy.

**Example**:
```
Before: We need to have a discussion regarding the matter of database optimization.
After:  We need to discuss database optimization.
[Same meaning, more concise with correct preposition usage]
```

## Priority System

**Universal application order:**

- **P0 (Must fix)**: Fixed collocations (Quick Ref #9-11), spatial/temporal errors (#1-2)
  - Wrong collocations cause grammatical errors
  - Examples: ~~depends of~~ → depends on, ~~in Monday~~ → on Monday
  
- **P1 (High value)**: Conciseness (#8), redundant prepositions (#12)
  - Verbose phrases reduce clarity
  - Examples: ~~in terms of~~ → (omit), ~~where...at~~ → where

- **P2 (Polish)**: Direction/abstract (#3-7), idioms (#13-15)
  - Improves naturalness and fluency
  - Examples: toward vs to, *on time* vs *in time*

**Application**: Fix P0 first (correctness), then P1 (clarity), then P2 (polish)

---

## Usage Workflow

**Step 1: Scan** — Identify errors by priority [→ Priority System]
- **P0 check**: Collocations (#9-11), spatial/temporal (#1-2) → ~~depends of~~, ~~in Monday~~
- **P1 check**: Verbose (#8), redundant (#12) → ~~in terms of~~, ~~where...at~~
- **P2 check**: Direction (#3-7), idioms (#13-15) → toward vs to, *on time*

**Step 2: Fix** — Apply corrections using patterns in Quick Reference above
- Replace errors with correct forms
- Simplify verbose phrases
- Preserve all semantic content

**Step 3: Validate** — Quality checks before finalization
- ✓ Semantic content preserved? ✓ More concise? ✓ Grammatically correct?
- Read aloud for naturalness

## Comprehensive Patterns (Advanced Reference)

**→ 80% of use cases covered above. Continue only if needed for edge cases.**

**Structure**: Hierarchical (foundation → application → refinement)

- **I. Spatial** (90%): at/on/in for location
- **II. Temporal** (85%): at/on/in for time  
- **III. Directional** (70%): to/toward/into/from/through for movement
- **IV. Abstract** (75%): about/on/of/for/with for concepts
- **V. Fixed Collocations** (80%): verb/adj/noun + preposition patterns
- **VI. Idiomatic Expressions** (60%): natural phrases and idioms
- **VII. Efficiency Patterns** (70%): eliminating verbosity and redundancy

---

## I. Spatial Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #1 | Priority: P0]

**Core Patterns** (90% usage):
- **at** (point): *at the door, at 123 Main St, at the conference, at school*
- **on** (surface): *on the table, on the bus, on Elm Street, on the screen*
- **in** (enclosed): *in the room, in Tokyo, in the database, in the system*

**Key Distinction**: at = point, on = surface/line, in = 3D enclosure
```
✓ at the station (point) | on the table (surface) | in Tokyo (area)
✗ in the station (unless inside building)
```

**Advanced Distinctions**:
- **between** (2 items) vs **among** (3+ items)
- **above** (higher, no contact) vs **over** (covering/spanning)
- **below** (lower) vs **under** (directly beneath)

---

## II. Temporal Prepositions
[← Quick Reference #2 | Priority: P0]

**Core Patterns** (85% usage):
- **at** (specific time): *at 3 PM, at noon, at the moment, at 25 (age), **at night***
- **on** (days/dates): *on Monday, on July 4th, on my birthday, on Monday morning*
- **in** (longer periods): *in 2024, in January, in summer, in the morning, in two hours*

**Key Distinction**: at = point in time, on = day/date, in = period/future duration
```
✓ at 9 AM | on Friday | in March | **at night** (exception)
✗ in 9 AM | in Friday | on March
```

**Duration/Deadline**:
- **for** (how long): *for two hours*
- **during** (when): *during the meeting*

- **toward** (direction, not arrival): *walk toward the exit, moving toward a solution*
- **into** (entering/transformation): *step into the room, turn into ice, translate into Chinese*
- **from** (origin/source): *come from, stem from research, from 9 to 5*
- **through** (passage/means): *drive through tunnel, learn through practice*

**Key Distinction**: to = reaching destination, toward = moving in direction, into = entering
```
✓ go to the office | walk toward the door | step into the room | come from Tokyo

```

**Example 3: Comprehensive (P0+P1+P2)**
```
✗ We need to discuss about the solution of this problem. The issue is different than expected. 
In the event of failure, retry. Where's the file at? Success depends of many factors.
✓ We need to discuss the solution to this problem. The issue differs from what we expected. 
If it fails, retry. Where's the file? Success depends on many factors.
