# Register & Formality for Natural English

**Type**: Dual-purpose - Supporting reference AND standalone post-check/improvement tool

**Task**: Enhance English content with appropriate register and formality level to achieve context-appropriate tone, professional credibility, and native-like fluency in technical/academic contexts.

**Definition**: Systematically calibrate word choice, phrasing, and tone to match formality expectations while maintaining natural, accessible language.

---

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Register adjustment enhances **appropriateness and professionalism** without changing **meaning or facts**.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all semantic content
- Match formality to context (academic ≠ email ≠ chat)
- Balance professionalism with readability
- Avoid over-formality (pretentious) and over-informality (unprofessional)

**Example**:
```
✗ We got the system working real good after we fixed a bunch of stuff.
✓ We successfully stabilized the system after addressing several issues.
```

## Formality Spectrum

**Framework**: Match register to context

```
FORMALITY LEVELS (informal → formal)

[Chat/Slack]
   get, find out, a lot of, really good, can't, I think
   
[Professional Email/Documentation]  
   obtain, determine, many, quite effective, cannot, we found
   
[Technical Report]
   acquire, ascertain, numerous, notably effective, is unable to, this study examines
   
[Academic Publication]
   procure, establish, substantial, significantly effective, does not, evidence demonstrates

[Legal] — Usually too formal for technical writing, avoid
```

**Context Examples**:
```
Chat:      "We can't get it working. Let's find out why."
Email:     "We cannot stabilize it yet. We're determining the cause."
Report:    "The system remains unstable. We are investigating root causes."
Academic:  "System stability has not been achieved. This study examines underlying factors."
```

**Common Mistakes**:
```
✗ Too informal:   "We'll check out how caching works."
✓ Appropriate:    "We examine how caching mechanisms operate."

✗ Over-formal:    "We shall endeavor to ascertain the verity of the assertion."
✓ Professional:   "We will verify the validity of this claim."
```

## I. Verb Formality

[← Quick Reference #1 | Priority: P1 | 85% usage]

**Core Patterns**:

```
Informal → Neutral → Formal

GET:
get results → obtain results → acquire results
get permission → obtain permission → secure permission

FIND:
find out → determine → ascertain
find problems → identify issues → detect deficiencies

SHOW/GIVE:
show results → present results → demonstrate results
give details → provide details → furnish details

DO/MAKE/CHECK:

```

**Acceptable Phrasal Verbs**:
```
✓ Technical terms: "log in," "boot up," "shut down," "scale up/out"
✗ Easily replaced: "find out" → "determine"
```

**Warning: Avoid Pretentious Formality**

## II. Quantifiers

[← Quick Reference #2 | Priority: P1 | 75% usage]

**Core Patterns**:

```
Informal → Neutral → Formal

A LOT OF / LOTS OF:
a lot of data → much data → substantial data
lots of users → many users → numerous users

VAGUE TERMS:
some improvements → several improvements → multiple improvements
kind of related → somewhat related → partially related
sort of works → appears to work → functions adequately

BIG/SMALL:
big improvement → significant improvement → substantial improvement
big problem → major problem → critical issue

COLLOQUIAL:
a bunch of → several, multiple
tons of / loads of → numerous, substantial
thing / stuff → element, component, factor
```

**Prefer Precise Quantification**:
```
✗ a lot of improvement
✓ 40% improvement [best - quantified]
✓ significant improvement [when numbers unavailable]

✗ big database
✓ 500GB database [best - quantified]
✓ large-scale database [when size varies]
```

**Usage**:
```

**Core Patterns**:

```
Informal → Neutral → Formal

OVERUSED:
really good → quite effective → notably effective
very important → important → critically important
very fast → fast / rapid → exceptionally rapid

INFORMAL:
pretty good → fairly good → reasonably effective
so important → very important → critically important
super fast → very fast → exceptionally fast
totally different → entirely different → fundamentally different
```

**Professional Intensifiers**:
```
✓ Use: significantly, substantially, considerably, notably, remarkably, critically, exceptionally
✗ Avoid in formal: really, very, so, super, totally, pretty
✓ Acceptable: quite, fairly, rather [moderate]
```

**Usage**:
```
✗ The optimization is really important and works really well. It's super fast now.
✓ The optimization is critically important and performs exceptionally well. Performance improved dramatically.
✓ The optimization demonstrates 60% improvement. [best - quantified]
```

---

## IV. Contractions

[← Quick Reference #4 | Priority: P0 | 90% usage]

**Avoid in Formal Writing**:

```
can't, won't, don't → cannot, will not, do not
it's, that's, there's → it is, that is, there is
we've, I'd, could've → we have, I would, could have
I'm, you're, they're → I am, you are, they are
```

**Context**:
```
Academic/Report: Never use contractions
Email: Acceptable if less formal
Chat/Slack: Standard and natural
```

**Common Errors**:
```
✗ it's [possessive - wrong]
✓ its [possessive] / it is [expanded]

✗ could of, should of [wrong]
✓ could have, should have [correct]
```

---

## V. Personal Pronouns

[← Quick Reference #5 | Priority: P2 | 65% usage]

**First Person (I, we)**:

```
Modern academic: "We" is acceptable; "I" avoided unless single-author
Traditional (older): Passive voice preferred

✓ Modern: "We found that caching improves performance."
✓ Formal: "This study found that caching improves performance."
✓ Passive: "Caching was found to improve performance."

✗ Overuse: "I think, I believe, I feel" [too subjective]
✓ Better: "This paper argues, Evidence suggests" [authoritative]
```

**Second Person (you) — Avoid in Academic**:
```
✗ Academic: "You can optimize by adding indexes."
✓ Academic: "Systems can be optimized by adding indexes."

✓ Documentation: "You can configure caching by..." [acceptable - instructional]
```

**Usage**:
```
✗ I think caching is good. You should use it.
✓ Evidence suggests caching improves performance. Systems benefit from caching implementation.

✗ Overuse: "We conducted research. We analyzed data. We found that..."
✓ Varied: "We conducted research and analyzed data. Results indicate that..."
```

---

## VI. Latin Abbreviations

[← Quick Reference #6 | Priority: P2 | 60% usage]

**Correct Usage**:

```
E.G. (for example):
✓ In parentheses: Several languages (e.g., Python, Java) are suitable.
✗ Main text: Use "for example" instead
✓ Always with comma: e.g., X, Y, Z

I.E. (that is):
✓ In parentheses: NoSQL databases (i.e., MongoDB, Redis) were tested.
✗ Main text: Use "that is" or "namely" instead
✓ Always with comma: i.e., specific clarification

ET AL. (and others):
✓ Citations: Smith et al. (2023) demonstrated...
✓ For 3+ authors after first citation
✓ No comma: Smith et al. [not Smith, et al.]

ETC. (and so forth):
✓ Use sparingly: Factors include latency, throughput, etc.
✗ Don't combine with "and": ✗ Python, Java, and etc. [redundant]
```

**Common Errors**:
```
✗ eg (missing periods/comma)
✓ e.g., (correct)

✗ e.g. confused with i.e.
✓ e.g., = "for example" (illustrative)
✓ i.e., = "that is" (specific clarification)

✗ Smith, et al. (comma before)
✓ Smith et al. (no comma)
```

---

## VII. Nominalizations

[← Quick Reference #7 | Priority: P2 | 55% usage]

**Definition**: Converting verbs to nouns (often -tion, -ment, -ance, -ence)

**When Appropriate**:
```
✓ Technical terms: implementation, optimization, configuration
✓ Established concepts: performance, scalability, throughput
✓ Abstract references: "The implementation was successful."
```

**Avoid Over-Nominalization**:
```
✗ Over-nominalized: "The implementation of the optimization resulted in the improvement of performance."
✓ With verbs: "Implementing optimization improved performance."
✓ Clearest: "Optimization improved performance."

✗ "The analysis of data led to the identification of problems."
✓ "Analyzing data identified problems."
✓ "Data analysis identified problems." [balanced]
```

**Balance Principle**:
```
✓ Use for: Established technical terms, abstract concept references
✗ Avoid: Chains of prepositional phrases, unnecessary complexity

✓ Balanced: "System optimization improves performance and reduces latency."
✗ Over-nominalized: "The optimization of the system results in the improvement of performance and the reduction of latency."
```

---

## VIII. Context Calibration

**Formality by Context**:

```
ACADEMIC PAPER (Highest):
✓ Formal verbs: conduct, examine, demonstrate
✓ No contractions: cannot, do not
✓ No phrasal verbs: determine (not "find out")
✓ Precise quantifiers: numerous, substantial
✓ Latin abbreviations in parentheses
✓ Limited first person: "We examine..." acceptable

Example: "This study examines distributed caching strategies. We conducted experiments evaluating Redis and Memcached. Results demonstrate that Redis achieves 30% lower latency under high load."

TECHNICAL REPORT (High-Medium):
✓ Professional verbs: use, implement, analyze
✓ Avoid contractions
✓ Some phrasal verbs OK: "set up," "boot up" (technical)
✓ Clear quantifiers: many, several
✓ First person acceptable: "We recommend..."

Example: "This document describes our caching implementation. We use Redis for session storage. Tests show Redis performs well under high load, achieving 30% lower latency."

PROFESSIONAL EMAIL (Medium):
✓ Readable: use, check, help
✓ Contractions acceptable (less formal)
✓ Phrasal verbs acceptable: "find out," "look into"
✓ Natural: several, a few
✓ First person common: "I think," "We found"

Example: "We've been testing Redis for caching. Initial results look promising—latency is about 30% lower. I'll share detailed findings next week."

TEAM CHAT (Low):
✓ Informal: get, check, find
✓ Contractions standard: can't, won't, it's
✓ Phrasal verbs natural: "figure out," "look at"
✓ Casual: a lot, a bit
✓ Conversational

Example: "Redis is working really well. Latency's way down—like 30% better. Can't wait to deploy this."
```

## Application Guidelines

**Calibration Priority**:
1. Identify context (paper / report / email / chat)
2. Match formality to context and audience
3. Fix P0 → P1 → P2
4. Preserve semantic content

**Common Pitfalls**:
```
Over-formality:
✗ "We shall endeavor to ascertain optimal parameters."
✓ "We will determine optimal parameters."

Under-formality:
✗ "We're gonna check out the system and figure out what's up."
✓ "We will investigate the system to diagnose the issue."

Inconsistency:
✗ "This study examines... We're gonna test... Results are pretty good."
✓ "This study examines... We test... Results are promising."
```

**Quality Checks**: ✓ Appropriate? ✓ Professional but readable? ✓ Consistent? ✓ Preserves meaning?

---

## Comprehensive Examples

**Example 1: Academic Register Elevation (P0+P1+P2)**
```
✗ Nowadays, lots of systems can't handle big loads. We're gonna look at caching stuff and figure out if it really helps. It's kind of like a must-have thing these days. We checked out Redis and found out it's way better. The results are pretty good and show tons of improvement.

✓ Currently, numerous systems cannot handle high load effectively. This study examines caching strategies to determine their impact on performance. Caching has become essential in modern system design. We evaluated Redis and determined that it demonstrates superior performance. Results are promising, indicating substantial improvement—specifically, 40% latency reduction under high-load conditions.

[Fixed: contractions, informal verbs, vague quantifiers, colloquialisms; added quantification]
```

**Example 2: Context-Appropriate Register**
```
Chat:     "We've been checking out Redis. It's way faster than what we had. Gonna deploy it next week."
Email:    "We've evaluated Redis for caching. It performs significantly better than our current solution. We plan to deploy next week."
Report:   "We evaluated Redis as a caching solution. Benchmarks demonstrate 40% performance improvement over the existing system. Deployment is scheduled for next week."
Academic: "This study evaluated Redis for distributed caching. Empirical results demonstrate 40% latency reduction compared to the baseline system."
```
