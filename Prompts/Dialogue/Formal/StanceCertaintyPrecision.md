# Stance & Certainty Language for Natural English

**Type**: Dual-purpose - Supporting reference AND standalone post-check/improvement tool

**Task**: Enhance English content with precise stance and certainty markers to achieve appropriate academic hedging, accurate claim strength, and native-like fluency in technical/academic contexts.

**Definition**: Systematically calibrate the strength of claims, assertions, and statements using hedging, modals, and qualifiers to achieve the appropriate balance between confidence and caution.

## How to Use This Document (MECE & 80/20 Approach)

**This document is organized using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) and 80/20 principles:**

### 80/20: Start Here for Quick Impact
**Most users need only 20% of content to handle 80% of situations:**
1. **Quick Reference** (13 patterns) — Decision table showing when to use each pattern
2. **Priority System** (P0 > P1 > P2) — Fix correctness first, then naturalness, then polish
3. **Certainty Spectrum** — Evidence-based decision tree for calibrating claim strength
4. **Post-Check Workflow** — 3-step process: Scan → Fix → Validate

### MECE: Deep Dive for Comprehensive Coverage
**For complete reference, patterns are organized into 6 mutually exclusive categories:**
- **I. Modals** — Possibility, necessity, hypotheticals
- **II. Hedging** — Verbs and adverbs that soften claims
- **III. Qualifiers** — Degree and extent limiters
- **IV. Intensifiers** — Strengthening language
- **V. Attribution** — Sourcing and citation
- **VI. Additional** — Approximators, negation, temporal markers

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Stance markers express **degree of certainty** without changing **factual content**.

**Conflict Resolution**: When fluency enhancements conflict with factual accuracy, always preserve accuracy.

**Rules**:
- **Preserve all factual content** from the original text
- Never add ungrounded claims or exaggerate certainty
- Match claim strength to evidence level
- Avoid over-claiming (too strong) and over-hedging (too weak)
- Balance confidence with academic humility

**Example**:
```
Before: The system is faster. [too absolute without evidence]
After:  The system appears faster. [appropriate hedging]
        The system is 30% faster. [evidence-backed, can be absolute]
```

**Calibration Examples**:
```
✗ Caching is always better. [too strong - no qualification]
✓ Caching typically improves performance. [moderate - qualified pattern]
✓ Caching reduced latency by 40% in tests. [strong - evidence-backed]

✗ The approach might possibly work. [over-hedged - redundant]
✓ The approach could work. [speculation - appropriately hedged]

✗ The system appears to have 99.9% uptime. [wrong - don't hedge measured facts]
✓ The system has 99.9% uptime. [definitive - stated fact with data]
```

**Quick Decision**: If you can't cite a source or show data → add hedging (#1, #4, #5)

---

## Standalone Usage: Post-Check Workflow

**Purpose**: Audit existing content and calibrate claim strength after writing.

### Step 1: SCAN — Identify Issues by Priority

**Search for these red flags in your text:**

| **Priority** | **Search Pattern** | **Look For** | **Example Problem** |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **P0** | `is`, `always`, `never`, `must`, `clearly`, `obviously` | Unsupported absolutes | "X is better", "This always works" |
| **P0** | Claims without citations | Unsourced assertions | "Research shows..." [no citation] |
| **P1** | `might possibly`, `seems to appear`, `could potentially` | Double hedging | "might possibly work" |
| **P1** | Strong adjectives without hedges | Missing qualifiers | "fast", "better", "efficient" |
| **P2** | `very`, `quite`, `really` | Vague intensifiers | "very fast", "quite good" |
| **P2** | Numbers without qualifiers | Missing approximators | "1000 requests" [estimated] |

### Step 2: FIX — Apply Patterns

**Use this decision process for each flagged item:**

```
1. Do I have evidence for this claim?
   └─ NO  → Add hedging: #1 (may/might), #4 (appears/seems), #5 (possibly/probably)
   └─ YES → Go to 2

2. Is my claim too strong for the evidence?
   └─ YES → Add qualifier: #7 (typically/generally), #10 (research shows)
   └─ NO  → Go to 3

3. Is my language too weak/redundant?
   └─ YES → Remove double hedging, strengthen with #8 (significantly)
   └─ NO  → Go to 4

4. Can I be more precise?
   └─ YES → Use #6 (degree), #8 (intensifiers), #11 (approximators)
   └─ NO  → Done ✓
```

**Quick fixes by priority:**
- **P0**: ~~is better~~ → appears better / is 30% better [add #4 or quantify]
- **P1**: ~~might possibly~~ → might [remove redundancy]
- **P2**: ~~very fast~~ → significantly faster [replace with #8]

### Step 3: VALIDATE — Quality Check

**Final verification checklist:**

- [ ] **Accuracy**: Does claim strength match evidence level?
- [ ] **Balance**: No over-claiming (too strong) or over-hedging (too weak)?
- [ ] **Attribution**: All strong claims cited or qualified? (#10)
- [ ] **Consistency**: Similar claims use similar certainty language?
- [ ] **Precision**: Vague words replaced with specific qualifiers? (#6, #8, #11)

**→ For comprehensive patterns with examples, continue to I-VI.**

## I. Modal Verbs

### A. Current Possibility/Ability
[← Quick Reference #1 | Priority: P0/P1]

**Weak Possibility** (20-50% confidence):
- *might* - speculation | *could* - possibility exists | *may* - formal possibility

**Strong Possibility/Ability** (60-80% confidence):
- *can* - general ability, current possibility | *should* - expected outcome

**Usage**:
```
✓ Optimization might improve performance. [untested speculation]
✓ Optimization should improve performance. [expected based on evidence]
✓ Caching can reduce latency. [demonstrated capability]

✗ System may potentially work. [redundant]
✓ System may work.
```

**Distinctions**:
- **can vs could**: can = current ability; could = hypothetical (see I.C)
- **may vs might**: may = formal (~50%); might = tentative (~30%)

---

### B. Necessity/Obligation
[← Quick Reference #2 | Priority: P0]

**Strong Obligation**: *must* - no alternative | *need to* - practical necessity

**Recommendation**: *should* - best practice | *ought to* - formal recommendation

**Weak Suggestion**: *could* - one option | *might want to* - gentle

**Usage**:
```
✓ You must validate input to prevent injection. [security requirement]
✓ You should add error handling. [best practice]
✓ You could consider Redis. [one option]

✗ You must consider optimization. [too strong for suggestion]
✓ You should consider optimization.
```

**must vs should**: must = absolute requirement; should = strong recommendation with flexibility

---

### C. Hypothetical/Conditional
[← Quick Reference #3 | Priority: P1]

**would** - hypothetical result | **could** - hypothetical possibility | **might/may** - uncertain outcome

**Usage**:
```
✓ If we added caching, latency would decrease. [hypothetical]
✓ Without optimization, the query would timeout. [counterfactual]
✓ We could use Redis, but PostgreSQL suffices. [option considered]
✓ A distributed approach might introduce consistency issues. [possible problem]

✗ This would improve performance. [needs condition]
✓ This would improve performance if implemented correctly.
```

---

## II. Hedging Devices

### A. Hedging Verbs
[← Quick Reference #4 | Priority: P1]

**Appearance**: *appears to, seems to* - observation needing confirmation

**Tendency**: *tends to, is prone to* - usual behavior

**Indication**: *suggests, indicates, implies* - evidence-based inference

**Belief**: *we believe, we assume, arguably, presumably* - judgment

**Usage**:
```
✓ System appears to have memory leaks. [needs confirmation]
✓ System has memory leaks. [confirmed with evidence]

✓ Redis tends to outperform Memcached for complex data. [general pattern]
✓ Data suggests correlation between X and Y. [evidence-based]

✗ It seems possibly related. [double hedge]
✓ It seems related.
```

---

### B. Probability Adverbs
[← Quick Reference #5 | Priority: P1]

**High** (70-90%): *probably, likely, presumably*

**Moderate** (40-60%): *possibly, perhaps, potentially*

**Low** (10-30%): *unlikely, improbably*

**Usage**:
```
✓ Optimization will probably improve performance. [expected]
✓ Refactoring could possibly introduce bugs. [acknowledging risk]
✓ Horizontal scaling is unlikely to solve this. [low probability]

✗ System is probably possibly slow. [redundant]
✓ System is probably slow.
```

**Positioning**: Before verb or sentence-initial with comma
```
✓ System probably needs optimization.
✓ Probably, the system needs optimization.
✗ System needs probably optimization. [wrong]
```

---

## III. Qualifiers

### A. Degree Qualifiers
[← Quick Reference #6 | Priority: P2]

**Moderate Degree** (50-75%): *relatively, fairly, reasonably, moderately*

**Note**: *quite* = "very" (British) or "fairly" (American) - avoid ambiguity in academic writing

**Usage**:
```
✓ System is relatively fast compared to alternatives. [explicit comparison]
✓ Approach is fairly effective. [moderately effective]
✓ System responds in 50ms. [best - quantified]

✗ System is very fast. [vague]
✓ System is reasonably fast.
```

**relatively vs fairly**: relatively requires explicit comparison; fairly = absolute moderate degree

---

### B. Extent Limiters
[← Quick Reference #7 | Priority: P1]

**Partial Extent**: *to some extent, partially, in part*

**Conditional Scope**: *in some cases, under certain conditions, in specific situations*

**Frequency**: *generally, typically, usually, often, frequently, for the most part*

**Exceptions**: *with exceptions, not always, not necessarily*

**Usage**:
```
✓ Approach works in most cases. [acknowledging exceptions]
✓ Caching improves performance in many scenarios. [qualified scope]
✓ Generally, NoSQL databases scale horizontally. [allows exceptions]

✗ NoSQL always scales horizontally. [too absolute]

✗ Criticism is valid to some extent partially. [redundant]
✓ Criticism is partially valid.
```

**generally vs usually vs typically**: generally = broad statement; usually = frequency (>50%); typically = characteristic behavior

---

## IV. Intensifiers & Certainty

### A. Intensifiers
[← Quick Reference #8 | Priority: P2]

**Precision Spectrum**:
```
Small:      slightly, marginally, minimally
Moderate:   moderately, reasonably, fairly
Large:      significantly, substantially, considerably
Very Large: dramatically, drastically, remarkably, notably
```

**Usage**:
```
✓ Latency decreased slightly (5%). [small]
✓ Latency decreased significantly (40%). [large]
✓ Latency decreased dramatically (80%). [very large]
✓ Latency decreased by 40%. [best - quantified]

✗ System is very fast. [vague]
✓ System is significantly faster. [better]
✓ System is 3x faster. [best]
```

---

### B. Certainty Expressions
[← Quick Reference #9 | Priority: P0/P2]

**High Certainty**: *clearly, evidently, undoubtedly, certainly* - use sparingly, risks arrogance

**Established Fact**: *it is well-known, research has shown, consistently, reliably*

**Warning**: High-certainty markers risk arrogance, over-claiming, condescension

**Usage**:
```
✓ Data clearly shows correlation. [evident from data]
✗ Clearly, this is best. [arrogant]
✓ Evidence suggests this is effective. [better]

✓ Algorithm clearly runs in O(n log n). [proven fact]
✗ Obviously, React is better. [opinion stated as fact]
✓ React may be better suited for large apps. [qualified]
```

**When appropriate**: Established facts, mathematical truth, cited evidence
**When inappropriate**: Subjective judgment, opinions, unsupported claims

---

## V. Attribution & Sourcing

[← Quick Reference #10 | Priority: P1]

**Source Attribution**: *according to X, as X states, X suggests/indicates/shows*

**Research**: *research shows, studies demonstrate, evidence suggests*

**Team/Experience**: *we believe, based on our analysis, in our experience*

**Qualified Scope**: *as far as we know, to the best of our knowledge, preliminary results suggest*

**Usage**:
```
✓ According to documentation, Redis supports clustering. [cited]
✓ Research indicates caching reduces latency 30-50%. [sourced]
✓ Based on our benchmarks, PostgreSQL outperforms MySQL. [qualified]

✗ PostgreSQL is better. [unsupported]

✗ Studies show caching works. [vague]
✓ Multiple studies demonstrate caching reduces load [1][2][3]. [specific]
```

**Strength Spectrum**:
- Strong: *demonstrates, proves, shows* [empirical]
- Moderate: *suggests, indicates, implies* [interpretive]
- Weak: *hints at, raises questions, may point to* [speculative]

---

## VI. Additional Patterns

### A. Approximators
[← Quick Reference #11 | Priority: P2]

**Core Patterns**: *approximately, roughly, about, around, circa*

**Usage**:
```
✓ System handles approximately 1000 QPS. [~±5%]
✓ Response time is roughly 50ms. [imprecise measurement]
✓ Database contains about 10M records. [rounded estimate]
✓ Architecture dates to circa 2015. [historical approximation]

✓ System handles approximately 1000 QPS.
```

**When to use**: Measurements with uncertainty, rounded figures, estimates, historical dates

---

### B. Negative Hedging
[← Quick Reference #12 | Priority: P1]

**Negating Absolutes**: *not necessarily, not always, rarely, seldom, infrequently*

**Usage**:
```
✓ Caching does not necessarily improve performance. [conditions apply]
✓ NoSQL is not always the best choice. [context-dependent]
✓ Denormalization rarely solves scalability issues. [uncommon]

✗ Caching never improves performance. [too absolute]
✓ Caching rarely helps in this scenario. [qualified negative]
```

**not necessarily vs not always**: not necessarily = conditional/logical; not always = temporal/frequency

---

### C. Time-Based Hedging

**Temporal Qualifiers**: *currently, at present, traditionally, historically, recently*

**Usage**:
```
✓ System currently supports 1000 QPS. [may change]
✓ Microservices are currently popular. [trend-based]
✓ Waterfall was traditionally used. [past practice]

✗ System supports 1000 QPS. [implies permanent if capacity may change]
```

## Application Guidelines

### Decision Matrix: Pattern Selection

**Use this matrix to choose the right pattern based on your situation:**

| **Evidence Level** | **Claim Type** | **Recommended Patterns** | **Examples** |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| None | Speculation | #1 (may/might/could) | "might work", "could help" |
| None | Recommendation | #2 (should/could) + #10 | "you could consider", "based on experience" |
| Observational | Pattern noticed | #4 (appears/seems/tends to) | "appears effective", "tends to fail" |
| Anecdotal | Limited data | #5 (possibly/probably) + #7 | "probably works in most cases" |
| Empirical | Measurements | #8 (quantified) or #7 + #10 | "significantly faster", "research shows" |
| Established | Proven fact | #9 (evidently) or direct statement | "clearly O(n log n)", "has 99.9% uptime" |

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**P0 Issues (Fix immediately):**
```
✗ X is always/never Y               → ✓ X typically/rarely Y [#7, #12]
✗ X is the best/worst               → ✓ X appears most effective for Y [#4, criteria]
✗ Everyone knows / Obviously X      → ✓ It is well-established / Research shows [#10]
✗ You must use X [recommendation]   → ✓ You should consider X [#2]
```

**P1 Issues (High impact fixes):**
```
✗ might possibly perhaps            → ✓ might / possibly [#1 or #5, choose one]
✗ seems to appear to suggest        → ✓ seems to / suggests [#4, choose one]
✗ could potentially maybe           → ✓ could / maybe [#1 or #5, choose one]
✗ System is fast [unqualified]      → ✓ System is typically fast [#7]
```

**P2 Issues (Polish):**
```
✗ very/really/quite fast            → ✓ significantly/substantially faster [#8]
✗ It's about around 1000            → ✓ approximately 1000 [#11, choose one]
✗ System supports X [temporal]      → ✓ System currently supports X [#13]
```

### Quick Calibration Formula

**Before publishing, apply this 3-question test to each claim:**

1. **Evidence check**: Do I have data/source? → NO = add hedging (#1, #4, #5)
2. **Scope check**: Is this always true? → NO = add limiters (#7, #12, #13)
3. **Precision check**: Can I quantify? → YES = use numbers instead of vague intensifiers (#8)

**Example application:**
```
Original: "Caching is faster and everyone uses it."

Q1: Evidence? → No empirical data → Add hedging
Q2: Always true? → No, context-dependent → Add scope limiter  
Q3: Can quantify? → No specific metrics → Keep qualitative but qualified

Result: "Caching typically improves performance and is widely adopted in web applications."
```

## Examples

### Complete Paragraph Transformation (80/20 Approach)

**Before (multiple issues):**
```
Our new caching system is always faster than the old one. Obviously everyone 
should use Redis because it's the best database. The implementation is very 
efficient and will definitely improve performance. You must migrate immediately 
as this never fails. Testing shows it works great, handling about approximately 
1000 requests per second. It seems to possibly be the perfect solution.
```

**Analysis (using Quick Reference patterns):**
- "is always faster" → P0, over-claiming [#7]
- "Obviously" → P0, arrogant [#9 → #4]
- "everyone should" → overgeneralization [#7]
- "must use" → P0, too strong [#2]
- "the best" → P0, unsupported [#4]
- "very efficient" → P2, vague [#8]
- "will definitely" → P0, over-claiming [#5]
- "must migrate" → P0, too strong [#2]
- "never fails" → P0, absolute [#12]
- "about approximately" → P2, redundant [#11]
- "seems to possibly" → P1, double hedge [#4, #5]

**After (calibrated using 13 patterns):**
```
Our new caching system typically performs faster than the previous version (#7). 
Redis may be well-suited for this use case (#1), as research suggests it handles 
concurrent operations effectively (#10). The implementation appears efficient (#4) 
and could significantly improve performance (#1, #8). We recommend evaluating 
migration (#2) as testing rarely revealed failures (#12). Benchmarks show it 
handles approximately 1000 requests per second (#11). Based on current results 
(#13), this appears to be a promising solution (#4).
```

**Key improvements:**
- Removed 6 P0 errors (over-claiming, absolutes)
- Fixed 2 P1 errors (double hedging, missing qualifiers)
- Polished 3 P2 issues (vague intensifiers, redundancy)
- Added attribution and evidence markers

### Individual Pattern Examples

**Over-Claiming (P0)**:
```
✗ Caching is always faster. Everyone knows this works.
✓ Caching typically improves performance. It is well-established that caching reduces latency.
[Fixed with #7 (extent limiter) and #10 (attribution)]
```

**Under-Hedging (P1)**:
```
✗ Algorithm is O(n²). Implementation is faster.
✓ Algorithm appears O(n²). Implementation tends to be faster for small inputs.
[Fixed with #4 (hedging verb) and #7 (extent limiter)]
```

**Over-Hedging (P1)**:
```
✗ System might possibly perhaps work to some extent.
✓ System could work in many cases.
[Fixed by removing redundant hedges - keep #1 (could) and #7 (many cases)]
```

**Evidence-Based (P2)**:
```
✗ Optimization helps. It's faster.
✓ Optimization significantly improved performance—reducing latency from 500ms to 50ms 
  in benchmarks. Based on results, this approach appears promising for similar workloads.
[Enhanced with #8 (intensifier), #10 (attribution), #4 (hedging verb)]
```

**Academic Stance (Comprehensive)**:
```
✗ Obviously caching fixes everything. It's the best solution. You must use Redis.

✓ Caching appears effective for this use case. Based on our analysis, Redis may be 
  well-suited. We recommend evaluating caching as it typically improves performance 
  30-50% in similar scenarios. Results may vary by workload.
[Fixed with #4, #10, #1, #2, #7 - comprehensive pattern application]
```

## Summary

### MECE Framework Structure
**6 mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive categories covering ~90% of stance/certainty patterns:**

| **Category** | **Purpose** | **Key Patterns** | **Section** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **I. Modals** | Express possibility, necessity, conditionals | *may, should, would, could* | [→ I] |
| **II. Hedging** | Soften claims, express uncertainty | *appears, seems, probably* | [→ II] |
| **III. Qualifiers** | Limit degree/scope | *relatively, generally, typically* | [→ III] |
| **IV. Intensifiers** | Strengthen/emphasize | *significantly, clearly, substantially* | [→ IV] |
| **V. Attribution** | Source claims | *research shows, based on* | [→ V] |
| **VI. Additional** | Special cases | *approximately, rarely, currently* | [→ VI] |

### 80/20 Principle Application
**80% coverage achieved through:**
- **Quick Reference**: 13 most frequent patterns (→ top of document)
- **Certainty Spectrum**: Evidence-based decision tree (→ calibration guide)
- **Priority System**: P0 > P1 > P2 (→ focus on correctness first)

**Most impactful patterns** (cover 80% of needs):
1. **P0 patterns**: #1 (modals), #2 (necessity), #9 (certainty) — prevent factual errors
2. **P1 patterns**: #4 (hedging verbs), #7 (extent limiters), #10 (attribution) — natural hedging
3. **P2 patterns**: #8 (intensifiers), #11 (approximators) — precision polish

### Core Principle
**Calibrate certainty to evidence**
- Avoid **over-claiming** (too strong without evidence)
- Avoid **over-hedging** (unnecessarily weak with evidence)
- **Match claim strength to evidence level** using Certainty Spectrum

### Usage Modes
1. **Supporting reference**: Consult patterns (I-VI) while writing
2. **Post-check tool**: Use 3-step workflow (Scan → Fix → Validate) after writing

**→ For detailed patterns and examples, see sections I-VI above**
