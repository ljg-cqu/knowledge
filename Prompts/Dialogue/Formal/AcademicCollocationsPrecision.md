# Academic Collocations for Natural English

**Type**: Dual-purpose - Supporting reference AND standalone post-check/improvement tool

**Task**: Replace incorrect/unnatural word combinations with established academic collocations for professional, native-like fluency.

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Enhance **naturalness** without changing **meaning or facts**.

**Conflict Resolution**: When fluency enhancements conflict with factual accuracy, always preserve accuracy.

**Example**: ~~We did research and made conclusions~~ → We conducted research and drew conclusions

## Application Guidelines

**Principle**: Preserve meaning, apply contextually, match formality, vary verbs

**Formality ladder**: get → obtain → acquire | show → present → demonstrate | find → identify → ascertain

**Transitivity**: Many academic verbs are transitive (no prep): discuss/analyze/examine/investigate/assess X [NOT "about"]  
Some require prep: focus on | depend on | consist of | relate to

**Variety**: Vary verbs to avoid repetition  
✗ We conducted research, conducted experiments, conducted analysis. [repetitive]  
✓ We conducted research, performed experiments, and analyzed data. [varied]

**Quality checks**: ✓ Facts preserved? ✓ Collocations correct? ✓ Natural? ✓ Professional? ✓ Varied?
