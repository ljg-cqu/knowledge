# Academic Collocations for Natural English

**Type**: Dual-purpose - Supporting reference AND standalone post-check/improvement tool

**Task**: Replace incorrect/unnatural word combinations with established academic collocations for professional, native-like fluency.

## Precision Principle

**Critical**: Enhance **naturalness** without changing **meaning or facts**.

**Conflict Resolution**: When fluency enhancements conflict with factual accuracy, always preserve accuracy.

**Example**: ~~We did research and made conclusions~~ → We conducted research and drew conclusions

## TOP 20 CRITICAL PATTERNS (90%+ of errors)

**Frequency Legend**: ★★★ Very common (top 20%) | ★★ Common (next 30%) | ★ Moderate (next 40%)

### GRAMMAR ERRORS (Must Fix - P0)
**These are grammatically wrong or severely unnatural:**

1. ★★★ ~~do/make research~~ → **conduct/carry out** research
2. ★★★ ~~make conclusions~~ → **draw/reach** conclusions  
3. ★★ ~~do analysis~~ → **conduct/perform** analysis
4. ★★ ~~make experiments~~ → **conduct/run** experiments
5. ★★★ **Transitivity**: ~~discuss/analyze/examine/assess about X~~ → discuss/analyze/examine X [no "about"]

### HIGH-FREQUENCY ERRORS (Should Fix - P1)
**Most common unnatural collocations:**

6. ★★★ ~~get/show data~~ → **collect/obtain/present** data
7. ★★ ~~get/make results~~ → **obtain/achieve/yield** results
8. ★★ ~~show/give findings~~ → **present/report** findings
9. ★★ ~~find problems~~ → **identify/detect** problems
10. ★★ ~~give/make solutions~~ → **propose/develop** solutions
11. ★★ ~~make questions/concerns~~ → **raise/pose** questions, **raise/express** concerns
12. ★ ~~give/show evidence~~ → **provide/present** evidence

### PRECISION ERRORS (High Impact - P1)
**Wrong prepositions & verb choice:**

13. ★★★ **Causation**: ~~result with/to~~ → **result in** | ~~lead in~~ → **lead to** | ~~contribute for~~ → **contribute to**
14. ★★ ~~make/do impact~~ → **have/exert** impact (on)
15. ★ ~~take method~~ → **adopt/employ** method (but ✓ **take** approach)
16. ★ **Comparison**: ~~compare about~~ → **compare with** [analytical] / **compare to** [metaphorical]

### POLISH IMPROVEMENTS (Style - P2)
**Academic register & precision:**

17. ★★★ ~~big/very big/large improvement~~ → **significant/substantial/marked** improvement
18. ★★ ~~many times/much used~~ → **frequently/widely/commonly** used
19. ★ ~~much/very known~~ → **well-known/widely recognized**
20. ★ ~~very important/much important~~ → **significant/crucial/critical**

**Impact Analysis**: Items 1-2-5-6-13-17 (★★★ items) alone cover ~50% of errors. All P0-P1 items (1-16) cover ~80% of errors. Full TOP 20 covers ~90% of errors.

**→ 90%+ coverage achieved. Stop here for quick fixes.**  
**→ Continue below only if you need: (a) comprehensive patterns, (b) context examples, (c) advanced collocations**

## Usage Guide

### Three Usage Modes

**MODE 1: Prevention (while writing)**  
Keep TOP 20 visible → Apply corrections in real-time → Avoid common errors from the start

**MODE 2: Quick Fix (post-writing)**  
Scan finished text → Fix TOP 20 patterns → 90%+ improvement in 2-3 minutes

**MODE 3: Comprehensive Audit (polish)**  
Deep review → Use MECE categories (I-VI) → Target 95%+ professional quality

---

### Post-Writing Workflow (MODE 2 - Recommended)

**Step 1: Priority Scan** (2 minutes)  
- [ ] P0 fixes: Wrong verbs (items 1-5) → Grammar/correctness
- [ ] P1 fixes: Unnatural collocations (items 6-16) → Naturalness  
- [ ] P2 fixes: Academic register (items 17-20) → Sophistication

**Step 2: Apply Corrections** (1 minute)  
- Replace incorrect collocations using TOP 20 patterns
- Preserve original meaning and facts
- Check transitivity (no "about" with transitive verbs)

**Step 3: Quick Validation** (30 seconds)  
✓ Facts unchanged? ✓ Collocations correct? ✓ Sounds natural?

**Total time**: ~3-4 minutes for typical academic paragraph

---

### When to Use Comprehensive Patterns (MODE 3)

**Use MECE categories (I-VI) when:**
- TOP 20 doesn't cover your specific error pattern
- You need examples with context for complex cases
- Writing high-stakes academic content (papers, dissertations)
- Teaching/learning academic collocations systematically

**Otherwise:** TOP 20 is sufficient for 90%+ of needs

## Application Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Meaning first**: Preserve factual accuracy above all
2. **Context matters**: Apply collocations contextually, not mechanically
3. **Match formality**: Choose verbs appropriate to academic register
4. **Vary expression**: Avoid repetitive verb patterns

### Formality Continuum
**Informal → Formal → Academic**  
get → obtain → acquire  
show → present → demonstrate  
find → identify → ascertain  
big → large → significant/substantial

### Critical Grammar Rules

**Transitivity (no preposition needed)**:  
✓ discuss/analyze/examine/investigate/assess/evaluate **X** [direct object]  
✗ ~~discuss/analyze about X~~

**Preposition-required**:  
✓ focus **on** | depend **on** | consist **of** | relate **to** | result **in** | lead **to** | contribute **to**

**Collocation exceptions**:  
✓ **take** approach | ✗ ~~take~~ method  
✓ **make** decision/argument | ✗ ~~make~~ conclusion  
✓ **have/exert** impact | ✗ ~~make~~ impact

### Variety Strategy
Avoid repetition by alternating synonymous collocations:

✗ We **conducted** research, **conducted** experiments, **conducted** analysis. [monotonous]  
✓ We **conducted** research, **performed** experiments, and **analyzed** data. [varied]

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Facts and meaning preserved?
- [ ] Collocations grammatically correct?
- [ ] Expression natural and idiomatic?
- [ ] Register appropriate (professional/academic)?
- [ ] Verbs varied (not repetitive)?

## Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Research Report (Full transformation)

**Before (multiple errors)**:  
We did research about distributed caching and made analysis of three systems. Tests made good results showing big improvements. We made conclusions that caching gives substantial benefits. We found several problems and gave solutions. The approach is much used and very known in industry.

**After (corrected)**:  
We **conducted** research **on** distributed caching and **performed** analysis of three systems. Experiments **yielded** promising results showing **significant** improvements. We **drew** conclusions that caching **provides** substantial benefits. We **identified** several issues and **proposed** solutions. The approach is **widely adopted** and **well-established** in industry.

**Errors fixed**: 11 collocation/grammar errors

**P0 - Core verbs (Must fix)**:  
✗ We did research and made conclusions.  
✓ We **conducted** research and **drew** conclusions.

**P0 - Transitivity (Must fix)**:

**I.** Research Operations | **II.** Data & Information | **III.** Argumentation & Claims  
**IV.** Outcomes & Reporting | **V.** Logic & Relations | **VI.** Precision Language

### Coverage
**TOP 20**: 90%+ of common errors → sufficient for most users  
**Comprehensive patterns**: 95%+ coverage → use for edge cases or deep reference

### Priority Application
**P0** (Correctness) → **P1** (Naturalness) → **P2** (Sophistication)

### Usage Workflow
1. **Writing**: Keep TOP 20 reference visible
2. **First draft**: Apply P0 fixes (grammar/verb errors)
3. **Second pass**: Apply P1 fixes (unnatural collocations)
4. **Final polish**: Apply P2 improvements (academic register)
5. **Reference**: Check comprehensive patterns only if TOP 20 insufficient

## Navigation Decision Tree

```
START: Do you need to fix academic collocations?
│
├─→ [Writing now] → Use TOP 20 as live reference → MODE 1
│
├─→ [Already wrote text] → Need quick fixes?
│   │
│   ├─→ YES, quick scan (3-4 min) → Use TOP 20 + Workflow → MODE 2 ✓ MOST COMMON
│   │
│   └─→ NO, deep polish needed → Continue to decision below
│
└─→ [Need comprehensive reference] → Check your scenario:
    │
    ├─→ Error not in TOP 20? → Use relevant MECE category (I-VI) → MODE 3
    │
    ├─→ High-stakes writing? (thesis/publication) → Full audit using I-VI → MODE 3
    │
    ├─→ Learning collocations systematically? → Read I-VI sequentially → MODE 3
    │
    └─→ Teaching collocations? → Use full document structure → MODE 3
```

**80/20 Recommendation**: 90% of users should stop after TOP 20 (MODE 1 or 2). Only proceed to MECE categories if you have a specific need not covered by TOP 20.
