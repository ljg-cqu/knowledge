## Design Principles

**MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**:
- Each guide covers distinct linguistic domain
- No significant overlaps between guides
- Together cover ~95% of fluency needs

**80/20 Pareto Principle**:
- Quick Reference sections target high-frequency patterns
- Comprehensive sections cover edge cases
- Progressive learning path (80% → 20%)

**Self-Contained**:
- Each guide is complete and independent
- No dependencies between files
- Use individually or in combination

**Priority-Driven**:
- P0 (Must fix): Correctness, professionalism
- P1 (High value): Naturalness, clarity
