## Guide Structure

**Precision guides (Formal/ + Root) follow this format**:
1. Quick Reference (80% coverage, top patterns)
2. Priority System (P0: must fix → P1: high value → P2: polish)
3. Standalone Post-Check Workflow
4. Comprehensive Framework (detailed patterns)
5. Examples (progressive complexity)
6. Summary

**Conversation & Format guides (Casual/ + Formal/) provide**:
- Pattern libraries with examples
- Before/after transformations
- Context-specific applications
- Fidelity principles (preserve content accuracy)
- Formality-appropriate markers and dynamics

## Design Principles

**MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**:
- Each guide covers distinct linguistic domain
- No significant overlaps between guides
- Together cover ~95% of fluency needs

**80/20 Pareto Principle**:
- Quick Reference sections target high-frequency patterns
- Comprehensive sections cover edge cases
- Progressive learning path (80% → 20%)

**Self-Contained**:
- Each guide is complete and independent
- No dependencies between files
- Use individually or in combination

**Priority-Driven**:
- P0 (Must fix): Correctness, professionalism
- P1 (High value): Naturalness, clarity
- P2 (Polish): Sophistication, precision

## Quick Start

**For Formal Writers (Academic Papers, Reports)**:
1. Start with PrepositionalPrecision (Root - most common errors)
2. Add RegisterFormalityPrecision (Root - context-appropriate tone)
3. Use Formal/ precision guides (DiscourseMarkers, StanceCertainty, AcademicCollocations)
4. Apply Post-Check workflows to audit completed writing

**For Formal Speakers (Presentations, Academic Discussions)**:
1. Master PrepositionalPrecision (Root - correctness foundation)
2. Choose format: ToPresentation or ToDiscussion (Formal/)
3. Apply ConversationDynamics (Formal/ - natural flow with professional tone)
4. Use Formal/ precision guides for language refinement

**For Casual Speakers (Team Chats, Peer Learning)**:
1. Master basic PrepositionalPrecision (Root - correctness foundation)
2. Choose format: ToConversation or ToDiscussion (Casual/)
3. Apply ConversationDynamics (Casual/ - natural informal flow)
4. Avoid over-formality while maintaining correctness

**For Learners (Progressive Mastery)**:
1. Start with Root guides (universal correctness)
2. Choose Casual/ or Formal/ based on context
3. Focus on Quick Reference sections first (80% coverage)
4. Master P0 patterns (correctness) → P1 (naturalness) → P2 (sophistication)
5. Build intuition through repeated practice
