# Guideline-to-Content Compliance Matrix

| Guideline ID | Summary | Current Coverage | Gap | Action |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------|--------|
| G1 | Define Context: State scope, constraints, assumptions | Specifications section (Scope and Structure, Content Principles) | None explicitly for assumptions | Add explicit assumptions section |
| G2 | Ensure Clarity: Use clear explanations and avoid undefined jargon | Mixed - some sections clear, others use jargon | Inconsistent jargon explanation | Improve glossary and add explanations |
| G3 | Maintain Precision: Use specific, consistent terminology | Inconsistent terminology throughout document | Inconsistent use of key terms | Normalize terminology |
| G4 | Stay Relevant: Focus only on topic information | Mostly relevant, but some tangential content | Minor tangential sections | Remove non-essential content |
| G5 | Use MECE Structure: Ensure complete, non-overlapping coverage | References MECE but structure has overlaps | Overlapping sections (Quality Gates, Pre-Submission) | Consolidate redundant sections |
| G6 | Provide Sufficient Coverage: Include all necessary aspects | Good coverage of business-architecture translation | Missing some LLM-friendly elements | Add LLM-specific sections |
| G7 | Include Multiple Perspectives: Present different viewpoints | Some perspectives covered (strategic, operational) | Limited alternative viewpoint discussion | Add section on considering alternatives |
| G8 | Ensure Depth: Cover topics with sufficient detail | Generally detailed | Some sections lack procedural depth | Add more step-by-step guidance |
| G9 | Ensure Accuracy: Verify factual correctness | Sources are cited but verification not emphasized | Missing validation of content | Add verification requirements |
| G10 | Prioritize Credible Sources: Use authoritative sources | Good source curation | Sources present but not emphasized | Highlight source credibility in text |
| G11 | Focus on Significance: Prioritize important information | Generally prioritized | Some trivial details present | Remove non-essential details |
| G12 | Maintain Logic: Demand coherent reasoning and sound structure | Logical flow in sections | Structure needs improvement | Reorganize with logical flow |
| G13 | Ensure Fairness: Request balanced perspectives, acknowledge assumptions | Limited balance in viewpoints | Acknowledges biases briefly | Expand bias acknowledgment |
| G14 | Use Concision: Remove redundancy and include only essential information | Redundant sections present | Multiple overlapping validation sections | Consolidate redundant content |
| G15 | Provide Structure: Use lists, tables, diagrams, formulas, code blocks | Good use of visual elements | Some inconsistent formatting | Standardize visual elements |
| G16 | Use Structured Format: Request output with TOC linking to sections | TOC present in examples | Missing in main sections | Add TOC to main sections |
| G17 | Include Evidence: Cite credible sources and flag uncertainties | Good source citations | Uncertainty not consistently flagged | Add uncertainty flags |
| G18 | Request Validation: Require reasoning, self-review, error checks | Validation steps present | No systematic self-review process | Add self-check mechanisms |
| G19 | Ensure Practicality: Make guidance actionable and implementable | Generally actionable | Some steps unclear | Clarify implementation steps |
| G20 | Define Success Criteria: Specify measurable, concrete outcomes | Success criteria implied | No explicit criteria section | Add success criteria section |
