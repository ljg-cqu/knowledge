# PM Interview Q&A: Scenario-Based Assessment Framework

Generate scenario-based questions testing senior+ PM judgment for hiring, development, calibration, training, and strategy alignment.

---

## Use Case 1: Hiring Senior+ PMs

**Challenge**: Behavioral interviews produce polished storytellers, not strategic thinkers.

**Solution**: 30 scenario-based questions (6 competencies × 5 questions; 20%F/40%I/40%A difficulty).

**Example**: "Top 5 enterprise customers (40% revenue) request feature conflicting with mass-market vision. Evaluate and decide."

**Interview Structure**:
- 1 topic/interviewer (5 questions)
- 3-4 questions/candidate
- 7-10 candidates/rotation

**Outcomes**:
- 85%+ hire/no-hire agreement
- 30% faster time-to-hire
- Framework application vs. memorization signal in 10-15 min

---

## Use Case 2: Competency Assessment & Development

**Challenge**: Arbitrary promotions, unclear leveling criteria ("What do I need for L6?").

**Solution**: 6-competency model mapped to F/I/A difficulty levels.

**Leveling**:
- **L4 (IC)**: F-level execution ("Track activation metrics")
- **L5 (Senior)**: I-level trade-offs ("Churn 8% vs. target 5%: features or retention?")
- **L6 (Director)**: A-level portfolio ("$5M for ONE: API, mobile, or international?")

**Process**:
1. 2-3 scenarios/competency
2. Evaluate analysis depth, framework application, trade-offs
3. Map to F/I/A
4. Develop next-level scenarios

**Outcomes**:
- Specific gap articulation
- Individualized development plans
- 90%+ promotions backed by scenario evidence

## Use Case 3: Interview Calibration

**Challenge**: Inconsistent interviewing (brain teasers vs. past projects), regrettable hires, false rejections.

**Solution**: Standardized scenarios + calibrated evaluation criteria.

**Calibration Session** (2 hours):
1. Review 5 Q&As with reference answers
2. Mock interview (same question)
3. Compare extracted signals
4. Define "strong answer" per competency
5. Document evaluation guide

**Example Criteria**:
```
Q: "Churn 8% vs. target 5%: features or retention?"

Strong (Hire):
- Quantifies: "8% churn = $2M ARR loss"
- Tests: "Segment-specific?"
- Trade-offs: "Features = acquisition, but..."
- Measurement: "Cohort retention weekly"

Weak (No Hire):
- Generic frameworks ("RICE...")
- No quantification
- Single-dimension
- No success criteria
```

**Outcomes**:
- 85%+ interviewer agreement
- 30% faster interview-to-offer
- Consistent candidate feedback

---

## Use Case 4: Training Program

**Challenge**: Framework memorization (RICE, JTBD, OKR, AARRR) without application ("I know we should use RICE, but...").

**Solution**: Case study curriculum with scenarios, group work, expert answers.

**Structure** (6 modules × 2 hours):
1. Strategy & Vision (5-6 scenarios)
2. Discovery & Research (4-5 scenarios)
3. Prioritization & Roadmap (5-6 scenarios)
4. Metrics & Analytics (4-5 scenarios)
5. Stakeholder Management (4-5 scenarios)
6. GTM & Growth (4-5 scenarios)

**Module Format**:
1. Scenario (5 min): Present dilemma
2. Group work (20 min): 3-4 PMs solve
3. Shareout (15 min): Present approaches
4. Expert answer (10 min): Reference with citations
5. Deep-dive (30 min): Limitations, alternatives, application context
6. Artifact review (10 min): Templates (matrices, dashboards, maps)

**Example** (Prioritization):
- **Scenario**: "CEO wants AI (6 months). Sales needs Q2. What do?"
- **Deep-Dive**: "When does RICE mislead? How supplement?"

**Outcomes**:
- 40% better framework application in reviews
- 25% higher stakeholder satisfaction
- PMs choose context-appropriate tools

## Use Case 5: Executive Strategy Alignment

**Challenge**: 6+ months of strategy debate (enterprise, PLG, international) without resolution.

**Solution**: A-level scenarios with multi-dimensional weighted scoring.

**Workshop** (Half-day):

**Part 1: Scenario** (30 min)
- Present choice: "3 bets (API, mobile, international). Resources for 1.5. How decide?"
- Context: Metrics, market, competition

**Part 2: Score** (30 min)
- Each exec scores: Revenue, Strategic Fit, Reach, Velocity, Moat, Risk

**Part 3: Discuss** (90 min)
- Surface scoring differences
- Debate weights ("Revenue 30% or 20%?")
- Test assumptions ("Why 6 months?")

**Part 4: Decide** (30 min)
- Finalize scores
- Document rationale + criteria

**Example Matrix**:
```
| Criterion      | Wgt | API | Mobile | Intl |
|----------------|-----|-----|--------|------|
| Revenue (12mo) | 30% | 7   | 5      | 4    |
| Strategic Fit  | 25% | 9   | 6      | 7    |
| Reach          | 20% | 6   | 8      | 9    |
| Velocity       | 15% | 5   | 4      | 3    |
| Moat           | 10% | 8   | 5      | 6    |
| **Score**      |     |**7.2**|**5.9**|**6.1**|

→ API (1.0) + Mobile (0.5)
```

**Outcomes**:
- 2 sessions vs. 6+ months
- Transparent criteria
- Documented precedent for future decisions

## Quick Start

**Hiring** (UC 1, 3):
1. Generate 30 questions (6F/12I/12A × 6 topics)
2. Calibrate hiring managers
3. Deploy: 1 topic/interviewer, 3-4 questions/candidate

**Development** (UC 2, 4):
1. Generate 30 F/I/A questions
2. Assess via scenarios (not stories)
3. Plan: "Practice 5 I-level Discovery"

1. Generate 5-8 A-level questions
2. Adapt for executive workshop
3. Use decision matrices

---

## Workflow

1. Identify use case
2. Define specs (25-30Q, difficulty mix: 20/40/40 for senior+)
3. Generate Q&A with citations
4. Validate (12-point gate)
5. Calibrate interviewers/facilitators
6. Iterate: feedback → retire weak Q → add contexts
