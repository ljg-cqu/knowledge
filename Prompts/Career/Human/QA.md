# Generation Workflow

## Step 1: Plan Coverage (MECE)

**Action**: Design 25-30 Q&As covering 8 dimensions (≥2 each) + 10 contexts (≥2 each); ensure 20% F / 40% I / 40% A distribution  
**Verify**: Total count 25-30; difficulty ratio correct; all dimensions/contexts covered; no overlap

## Step 2: Establish References

**Action**: Create foundational references before writing Q&As  
- **Glossary** (≥15): Psychology terms + relationships + dimension links + inline definitions  
- **Tools** (≥8): Validated assessments with URLs (updated ≤24 months), reliability/validity data, adoption metrics  
- **Literature** (≥10): Authoritative sources (Maslow, Rogers, Goleman, Dweck, Kahneman, Seligman, Brown, etc.)  
- **Citations** (≥18): APA 7th format; 60/30/10% EN/ZH/Other; peer-reviewed priority  

**Verify**: Counts met; ≥50% published <10 years; ≥3 source types; <25% single source; 100% valid URLs

## Step 3: Generate Q&As

**Structure**: ≥70% understanding questions (How/Why/Compare/Explain); 200-350 words: Context → Psychology → Theory → Application → Considerations  
**Requirements**: ≥1 citation (≥2 for advanced); research-backed claims; ≥2 perspectives with comparison table; address individual differences; explicit dimension-context mapping  
**Quality Check (Every 5 Q&As)**: Word count, citations, research basis, difficulty level, evidence quality, coverage balance

## Step 4: Add Artifacts

**Per Dimension** (not per Q&A): Model/diagram (Mermaid <120 nodes) + theory (cited) + comparison table + assessment (formula + scoring + interpretation + research validation)  
**Verify**: All 4 artifacts present; Mermaid renders; theories cited; formulas valid; research-backed

## Step 5: Link References

**Action**: Populate all sections → Extract [Ref: ID] tags → Verify references exist → Remove orphans → Validate all URLs  
**Verify**: Reference counts correct; 100% cross-refs resolved; 0 broken links; 60/30/10% language ratio; no orphaned references

## Step 6: Validate (23 Checks)

| # | Check | Target | # | Check | Target |
|---|-------|--------|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Counts | G≥15, T≥8, L≥10, A≥18, Q=25-30 | 13 | Artifacts | ≥90% 4/4 |
| 2 | Citations | ≥70% ≥1; ≥30% ≥2 | 14 | Theories | ≥80% used |
| 3 | Language | 60/30/10% EN/ZH/Other | 15 | Assessments | ≥60% have |
| 4 | Recency | ≥50% <10yr (psychology) | 16 | Models | ≥80% have |
| 5 | Diversity | ≥3 types; <25% single | 17 | Syntax | 100% valid |
| 6 | Links | 100% valid | 18 | Formulas | 100% valid |
| 7 | Cross-refs | 100% resolved | 19 | Dimensions | 8 dimensions ≥2 |
| 8 | Word count | Sample 5: 200-350 | 20 | Contexts | 10 contexts ≥2 |
| 9 | Evidence | ≥80% research-backed | 21 | Review | 6/6 criteria |
| 10 | Per-topic | ≥2 sources + ≥1 assessment | 22 | Individual differences | ≥70% addressed |
| 11 | Traceability | ≥80% theory→application | 23 | Peer-reviewed | ≥50% research |
| 12 | Question type | ≥70% understanding | | | |

**Critical**: ANY validation failure → STOP immediately → Fix root cause → Re-validate ALL 23 checks → Iterate until 23/23 PASS

## Step 7: Final Review (6 Criteria)

**Quality Gates**:

1. **Clarity** (Guideline 2): Logical flow; consistent terminology; all psychological terms defined inline first use; no unexplained jargon
2. **Accuracy** (Guideline 11-12): Verifiable research with citations; established theories properly attributed; validated assessment tools; correct dimension-context mappings; factual correctness
3. **Completeness** (Guideline 6): All 8 dimensions ≥2 Q&As; all 10 contexts ≥2 Q&As; all reference minimums met (G≥15, T≥8, L≥10, A≥18); 23/23 validation PASS
4. **Balance** (Guideline 7, 15): ≥2 perspectives per topic with comparison tables; individual differences addressed; assumptions/limitations/biases acknowledged; tagged [Universal]/[Context-dependent]/[Emerging]
5. **Practicality** (Guideline 20): Actionable guidance; implementable in real contexts; applicability boundaries stated; expert consultation flagged when needed; respects diversity
6. **Correctness** (Guideline 4, 10, 13): No redundancy; no inconsistencies; no coverage gaps; no orphaned references; culturally sensitive; on-topic

**Submission Criteria**: 23/23 validation PASS + 6/6 review PASS
**High-Risk Areas**: Dimension-context matrix completeness, cultural sensitivity, research validity, URL validity, cross-reference integrity, clinical/diagnostic claims
