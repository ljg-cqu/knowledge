## Examples

### F (20%): Explain + Apply
**Q**: What is the Sharpe Ratio and when should it be used?  
**A** (~150w): Sharpe Ratio [Ref: G1] = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation; measures risk-adjusted returns. ≥1.0 is good, ≥2.0 excellent [Ref: L1]. Use for comparing strategies/portfolios with similar return distributions on risk-adjusted basis [Ref: A1]. **Limitations**: Assumes normal distribution—fails with fat tails, skew [Ref: L2]. Penalizes upside volatility equally; use Sortino for asymmetric returns [Ref: G8]. Sensitive to measurement period and sampling frequency [Ref: A2]. Doesn't capture tail risk (use VaR/CVaR) [Ref: G2]. Best for symmetric, near-normal strategies; misleading for options, crisis alpha.

### I (40%): Diagnose + Apply Multiple
**Q**: Equity long/short strategy: Sharpe 1.8, max DD -18%, current DD -12% (4 months). VaR breached 3× this quarter. Assess risk exposure.  
**A** (~180w): Sharpe 1.8 is strong [Ref: G1], but -18% max DD and -12% current DD (approaching max) with VaR breaches signal elevated risk [Ref: G2, G6]. Variables: (1) Position concentration or factor crowding [Ref: L3]; (2) Increased correlation in drawdown (diversification breakdown) [Ref: A5]; (3) Vol regime shift [Ref: L4]. **Approach**: Decompose PnL attribution [Ref: G13] by sector/factor using Bloomberg PORT [Ref: T1]; check factor exposures (momentum, value, size) vs. limits [Ref: G15]; stress test [Ref: A7] under 2008/2020 scenarios; calculate CVaR [Ref: L2] for tail risk beyond VaR. **Decision**: Reduce gross exposure 20-30% if factor concentration >40% in single factor or stress loss >25%. **Limitations**: Attribution lags; factor models explain 60-80% [Ref: L3]. DD recovery time uncertain [Ref: G6]. Risk metrics backward-looking [Ref: A5].

### A (40%): Synthesize + Justify
**Q**: Portfolio: 60/40 stocks/bonds, Sharpe 0.9, correlation rising to 0.6 (was 0.2). CIO wants higher returns without more risk. Respond.  
**A** (~280w): Rising stock/bond correlation undermines 60/40 diversification—"correlation breakdowns" in QE era [Ref: L4, A10]. 0.9 Sharpe adequate but constrained by dual headwinds: rising rates hurt bonds, inflation pressures stocks [Ref: A11]. Correlation 0.2→0.6 reduces portfolio efficiency [Ref: G14, L1]. **Response**: "60/40 faces structural headwinds. Propose multi-asset risk parity [Ref: L5, G14] or alternatives allocation." **Strategy**: (1) Q1: Allocate 15% to alternatives (commodities, trend-following CTAs, market-neutral) [Ref: L5, A12]—low correlation to stocks/bonds (0.1-0.3) [Ref: A10]; (2) Q2: Shift to risk parity weighting by volatility, not capital [Ref: G14]; rebalance using Black-Litterman [Ref: L6] with macro views; (3) Q3-Q4: Tail hedge via OTM puts (1-2% budget) [Ref: L2]; options overlay for yield. **Alternative**: Leverage 60/40 to 1.5× with futures if Sharpe target >1.2 [Ref: L5]—but increases tail risk. **When NOT**: Crisis/deleveraging (alternatives illiquid) [Ref: L2]; if board rejects complexity. **Limitations**: Alternatives have 1-3yr lockups, higher fees (2/20) [Ref: A12]; risk parity amplifies vol in crisis [Ref: L4]; leverage magnifies drawdowns; rebalancing costs 30-50bps [Ref: A13]. Requires sophisticated risk infrastructure [Ref: T2].

## Complete Example

**Q**: How manage position when VaR breached 3 days running, volatility +40%, correlation to SPX rising from 0.3 to 0.7?

**Difficulty**: A | **Domain**: Risk Management, Portfolio Management  
**Key Insight**: Tests crisis risk response; distinguishes systematic risk managers from reactive traders.

**Answer** (285w):  
**Context**: VaR breach 3× + vol +40% + correlation 0.3→0.7 signals regime shift—diversification breakdown and elevated tail risk [Ref: G2, G6, A5].

**Analysis**: Root causes [Ref: L4]: (1) Vol regime change (low→high); VaR model calibrated on past [Ref: G2]; (2) Correlation spike (crisis contagion) undermines diversification [Ref: A10]; (3) Position concentration or factor crowding [Ref: L3]. Decompose: check factor exposures [Ref: G13, G15], Greeks [Ref: G3], stress scenarios [Ref: A7].

**Reasoning**: VaR assumes normal distribution—fails in fat tails [Ref: L2, A2]. 3× breach = model failure or structural change. Rising SPX correlation means systematic risk dominates [Ref: G5, L1]. Vol +40% increases tail risk exponentially (gamma/convexity effects) [Ref: G3, L2]. Must recalibrate risk model [Ref: T2] and reduce exposure immediately [Ref: A7].

**Recommendations**: 3-phase crisis protocol [Ref: L4, A11]: (1) Day 1: Cut gross exposure 30% (liquidate lowest-conviction, most-correlated positions) [Ref: L3]; hedge systematic risk (SPX puts, VIX calls) [Ref: G3, L2]; (2) Day 2-3: Recalibrate VaR with recent 60d data + stress scenarios (2008, 2020) [Ref: T2, A7]; calculate CVaR for tail beyond VaR [Ref: L2]; (3) Week 1-2: Rebalance to target risk (reduce factor concentration <40% single factor) [Ref: G15]; improve diversification (lower correlation assets) [Ref: L5].

**Implementation**: Emergency risk committee daily 1-wk, then weekly [Ref: A11]. Real-time Greeks monitoring [Ref: T1]. CRO approval for deviations. Expect PnL hit -5-10% from deleveraging/hedging costs.

**Metrics**: VaR compliance >95%, CVaR <15%, correlation to SPX <0.5, max DD <20%, factor concentration <40%.

**When NOT**: If vol spike is transient event-driven (single stock, no contagion) vs. regime shift [Ref: L4]; or if selling into panic creates worse losses.

**Limitations**: VaR recalibration has estimation error [Ref: A2]; hedges costly (vol premium 20-30%) [Ref: L2]; deleveraging locks in losses; correlation may persist 3-6mo [Ref: A10]. Real-time data lags; execution slippage in volatile markets [Ref: T1]. CVaR needs sufficient tail data [Ref: L2]. Crisis requires judgment beyond models [Ref: L4, A11].
