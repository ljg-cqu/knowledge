# Creativity & Innovation Q&A Generator (Optimized)

Generate **6-12 decision-critical Q&A pairs** for informed innovation decisions with minimal time investment. Focus: techniques that block decisions or create material risk (missed market opportunity, team disengagement, innovation stagnation).

## Scope & Requirements (60% Reduction)

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Audience** | ≥5 core stakeholder roles (PM, Architect, Developer, QA, Leadership) |
| **Context** | Production systems, multi-team, innovation-driven domains |
| **Output** | **6-12 Q&As**: 3-4 decision-critical dimensions × 4-5 lifecycle phases |
| **Q&A Count** | **6-12 total**; 4-5 phases (≥1/phase); ≥5 stakeholder roles |
| **Answer** | 150-250 words: Business need → Technique → Workflow → Productivity → Trade-offs |
| **Citations** | ≥1 each; canonical sources only |
| **Artifacts** | ≥1 Mermaid diagram + ≥1 metrics table per Q&A |
| **Success** | 12/12 validation PASS |

## Decision Criticality Framework (NEW)

**Include if ≥1 criterion satisfied**:
- **Blocks Decision**: Directly impacts innovation strategy, team capability, or product direction
- **Creates Risk**: Material threat (missed market opportunity, team disengagement, innovation stagnation)
- **Affects ≥2 Stakeholders**: Multi-team impact (PM + Architect, Developer + QA, etc.)
- **Actively Evolving**: Creativity/innovation practices changing in past 3-6 months
- **High Adoption Barrier**: >40h effort to implement/learn

**Exclude if**: Niche/legacy (<5% adoption), Orthogonal/nice-to-have, Already covered, Speculative

## Coverage Dimensions (Optimized)

**3-4 Decision-Critical Dimensions** (vs 6):
- **(1) Technical Innovation** - novel architectures, innovative algorithms, tech adoption (Blocks decision)
- **(2) Business/Market** - Blue Ocean, disruptive innovation, business models (Creates risk, Affects stakeholders)
- **(3) Collaborative** - co-creation, cross-pollination, team ideation (Affects stakeholders, Adoption barrier)
- **(4) Cognitive Problem-Solving** - problem framing, analogical reasoning, systems thinking (Blocks decision)

**4-5 Decision-Critical Phases** (vs 8):
- Requirements & Discovery (Blocks alignment)
- Architecture & Design (Blocks architecture)
- Development (Creates velocity risk)
- Deployment & Release (Blocks release)
- Evolution & Governance (Affects strategy)

## Content Standards

**Traceability**: Business need → Creativity technique → Innovation workflow → Productivity metrics → Quality improvements

**Quantified Creativity Impact**: ✅ "Design thinking: 3x idea generation, 40% faster problem validation, 25% better user satisfaction" ❌ "Creative approaches help"
