**Quantified Creativity Impact**: ✅ "Design thinking: 3x idea generation, 40% faster problem validation, 25% better user satisfaction" ❌ "Creative approaches help"

**Context Thresholds**: Team maturity (Ad-hoc <3mo vs Systematic 3-12mo vs Culture >12mo); Innovation frequency (Incremental/Breakthrough/Disruptive); Diversity (Homogeneous/Cross-functional/Cross-industry); Problem complexity (Tame/Wicked)

**Requirements**: ≥2 approaches with comparison; structured vs free-form boundaries; quantify impact (time, quality); cite techniques (SCAMPER, TRIZ, Design Thinking, Six Hats)

## Artifacts Per Q&A

| Dimension | Diagram Type | Technique Examples | Metric Formula |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Behavioral | Mind map, Ideation flow | Brainstorming, SCAMPER, Lateral | `Ideas = Quantity × Quality` |

# Generation Process

**Step 1 - Plan**: Map 8 phases × 6 dimensions → Allocate 30-35 Q&As (≥3/phase, ≥8 stakeholder roles) → Balance technique categories. *Check*: 30-35 total, all 8 phases, ≥8 roles, 6 dimensions balanced, ≥70% judgment-based

**Step 2 - References**: Build G≥25, T≥10, L≥12, A≥18 with relationships/URLs. *Check*: Counts met, 60/30/10% EN/ZH/Other (±10%), ≥50% <5yr, ≥4 types, <25% single source, 100% valid URLs

**Step 3 - Write Q&As**: 150-350 words; ≥1 citation (≥2 complex); Business need → Technique → Workflow → Productivity → Quality → Human boundaries → Risks; ≥2 approaches with comparison. *Validate every 5*: word count, citations, stakeholder, phase, technique, metrics

**Step 4 - Artifacts**: Per Q&A: (1) Mermaid <120 nodes; (2) Workflow 5-30 lines; (3) Comparison table ≥2 approaches; (4) Metrics (formula + baseline + creative + % gain). *Check*: ≥90% have all 4, diagrams render, workflows actionable, metrics quantified

**Step 5 - Link**: Populate sections → Verify `[Ref: ID]` → Remove orphans → Validate URLs. *Check*: All IDs resolved, 0 broken links, no orphans

**Step 6 - Validate (23 Checks)**:
