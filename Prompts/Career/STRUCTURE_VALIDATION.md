## Maintenance Guidelines

### Review Frequency
- **Quarterly**: Check for outdated citations (target: <50% older than 3 years)
- **Bi-annually**: Validate stakeholder and lifecycle coverage
- **Annually**: Reassess MECE structure and emerging domains

### Addition Criteria
Add new file ONLY if:
1. Decision-critical (blocks decisions or creates material risk)
2. Provides unique value not covered by existing files
3. Affects ≥2 core stakeholder groups
4. Has ≥5 years of relevance horizon

### Deletion Criteria
Remove file if:
1. Becomes non-critical (<5% adoption or low-stakes)
2. Rarely used in practice
3. Superseded by newer frameworks or approaches

### Update Priority
Refresh file when:
1. >50% citations are outdated (>3 years old)
2. Significant framework changes (e.g., GDPR → CCPA evolution)
3. New decision-critical patterns emerge
