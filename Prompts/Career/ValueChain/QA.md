# Value Chain Analysis Q&A Generator (Minimal Viable)

Generate 4–6 decision-critical scenario-based questions testing value chain analysis for informed strategic decisions with limited time.

## I. Context

**Purpose**: Assess value chain analysis capabilities for decision-critical scenarios only (Participants → Flows → Opportunities → Disruption) that block decisions or create material risk.

**Target Audience**: Strategy, Product, Finance, Operations leaders making go/no-go, pricing, market entry, or business model decisions.

**Decision Criticality Framework** (NEW):
- **Include if ≥1 criterion satisfied**:
  - Blocks Decision: Directly impacts go/no-go, market entry, business model pivot, pricing strategy, competitive positioning
  - Creates Risk: Material threat (margin compression >10%, disintermediation, power shift, network collapse, revenue loss >$5M)
  - Affects ≥2 Stakeholders: Multi-team impact (Strategy + Finance, Product + Operations, BD + Compliance)
  - Requires Action: 1–6mo action window (not speculative)
  - Quantified Impact: Value pool %, margin pressure, market size, disruption timeline, competitive threat
- **Exclude if**: Niche/legacy (<5% adoption), Orthogonal/nice-to-have, Already covered, Speculative

**Scope**: Decision-critical value chain scenarios only (full chain analysis: participants/flows/economics/power dynamics). **Exclude**: Single-node focus, trivia, recall-only, academic exercises.

**Assumptions**: LLM knows core frameworks (Value Pool, Theory of Constraints, Switching Costs, Network Effects); 5–10min per question.

**Limitations**: Scenarios require industry customization; economics context-dependent; power dynamics vary by market.

## III. Execution (Streamlined)

### Step 1: Plan Allocation (Decision-Critical Only)

Identify 4–6 decision-critical scenarios across 2–3 industries/domains (25%F/50%I/25%A). Each Q&A must satisfy ≥1 Decision Criticality criterion.

**Example** (6):
- Q1–Q2: Value Pool/Power Dynamics (SaaS marketplace, E-commerce) → 1F/1I
- Q3–Q4: Disruption/Network Effects (FinTech, Platform) → 1I/1A
- Q5–Q6: Margin Compression/Bottleneck (Healthcare, Manufacturing) → 1F/1I/1A

## VII. Example

**Q1: A B2B SaaS marketplace connects software vendors with enterprise buyers. Platform takes 25% of transaction value. Vendors complain about high fees and lack of qualified leads (40% close rate vs. 60% direct). Platform argues network effects justify pricing. CFO: margin pressure. Product: churn risk. Assess total value distribution across the chain and recommend strategy?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Industry**: B2B SaaS → Marketplace (cross-industry) | **Analysis Types**: Value Pool, Power Dynamics, Network Effects, Bottleneck | **Stakeholders**: Platform Strategy, Product, Finance, BD/Sales (vendors), Procurement (buyers)

**Key Insight**: Value pool analysis reveals platform captures disproportionate value (48% profit on 25% revenue share) while bottleneck at lead qualification creates vendor dissatisfaction, threatening network effects moat and long-term sustainability.

**Answer** (287 words):

Apply **Value Pool Analysis** [Ref: G2] + **Network Effects** [Ref: G4] + **Theory of Constraints** [Ref: G5] for ecosystem assessment.

**Multi-analysis**:
- **Value Pool** [Ref: A7]: $100M GMV | Platform: $25M revenue, 60% margin = $15M profit (60% of pool) | Vendors: $75M revenue, 20% margin = $15M profit (60% of pool) | Buyers: value unclear → **Platform captures disproportionate profit on lower revenue share** [Ref: L3].
- **Power Dynamics** [Ref: G6]: Platform: High (pricing control, access to buyers) | Vendors: Medium (multi-homing to direct/competitors) | Buyers: Low (limited alternatives, switching costs) | **Insight**: Vendor multi-homing weakens network [Ref: A11].
- **Network Effects** [Ref: G4]: Type: Marketplace (2-sided) | Dynamic: vendors→selection→buyers→GMV→vendors | **Bottleneck**: Lead quality (40% vs. 60% direct) degrades value prop → vendors reduce commitment → weaker network [Ref: L8].
- **Bottleneck** [Ref: G5]: Lead qualification | Capacity mismatch: 1000 buyers/mo, only 400 qualified | Cost: 600 vendors×$50K lost ACV×60% win=$18M/yr opportunity cost.

**Chain flows**: **Info**: Vendor listings→Platform→Buyer searches (friction: poor matching) | **Product**: SaaS delivery post-sale (direct) | **Capital**: Buyer pays platform→platform pays vendor-25% (friction: delay, high take rate).

**Stakeholder views**: Finance: protect 60% margin; Product: improve qualification to reduce churn; Strategy: balance pricing with network health; Vendors: lower fees OR better ROI; Buyers: more qualified vendors.

**Trade-offs**: (1) Reduce fees (25%→15%): vendor retention, -$10M revenue | (2) Improve qualification: +$150K ML investment, better ROI, network strengthens | (3) Freemium vendors: acquisition, dilutes quality | (4) Verticalize: fewer but higher-quality networks [Ref: L5].

**Success criteria**: Track vendor multi-homing rate, close rate parity (60%), GMV growth, NPS, take rate sustainability over 24mo.

**Limitations**: GMV/margin estimates ±20%; network tipping point uncertain; competitor response unknown.

**Artifact**:

| Participant | Revenue | Margin | Profit | % of Pool | Power | Switching Cost |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Platform** | $25M | 60% | $15M | 50% | High | N/A |
| **Vendors** | $75M | 20% | $15M | 50% | Medium | Low (multi-home) |
| **Buyers** | -$100M | N/A | N/A | N/A | Low | Medium (integration) |
| **Total Pool** | | | **$30M** | | | |

**Communication**:
- **Finance**: Reduce fees 10% = -$2.5M revenue BUT retain $18M GMV (net +$15.5M)
- **Product**: Invest $150K in AI matching → 40%→60% close rate → vendor satisfaction
- **Strategy**: Current take rate unsustainable; network at risk without qualification fix
- **Vendors**: "We hear you on fees. Investing in lead quality first (6mo), then revisit pricing"
- **BD**: Position as quality-first marketplace, not volume

**Recommendation**: Phase 1 (Q1-Q2): Fix qualification bottleneck ($150K ML, partnerships with data providers) | Phase 2 (Q3): Measure close rate improvement | Phase 3 (Q4): Reduce fees to 20% IF close rate reaches 55%+ | Monitor vendor retention, GMV, margin quarterly

**Confidence**: Medium (margin estimates ±20%; vendor behavior depends on close rate improvement success)

## VII. Quick Reference: Decision-Critical Frameworks

### Value Pool Analysis
**Method**: Revenue/node → Margins/node → Profit pool (Revenue×Margin) → Visualize (stacked bar)
**Q**: Where profit concentrated? Vulnerable nodes? Fair distribution?

### Power Dynamics
**Indicators**: Pricing control | Switching costs | Information asymmetry | Network benefits | Regulatory barriers | Brand loyalty
**Visualization**: High=bold | Medium=normal | Low=thin | Arrows=influence

### Bottleneck (Theory of Constraints)
**Method**: Cycle time/node → Longest/highest failure → Throughput capacity → Demand/capacity mismatch → Cost (lost revenue/churn)
**Application**: Identify → Exploit → Subordinate → Elevate → Repeat

### Network Effects
**Types**: Direct (users→value) | Indirect (users→complements) | Data (usage→product) | Marketplace (buyers↔sellers) | Platform (developers→features)
**Q**: Which nodes benefit? Min viable network? Defensible?

## VIII. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| **Incomplete Participants** | Interview ("Who else?"), follow money, check associations |
| **Static Analysis** | Always map today + 5yr, track tech/regulatory/social trends |
| **Activity ≠ Value** | Ask "remove node→what breaks?", calculate value vs cost |
| **Single Stakeholder** | Systematic multi-perspective, interview all types |
| **No Quantification** | Estimate (rough OK), use Fermi, mark assumptions |
| **Ignore Coordination** | Map handoffs, delays, misaligned incentives |

## IX. Summary: Minimal Viable ValueChain/QA.md

**Goal**: 4–6 decision-critical Q&As for informed value chain decisions with limited time.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Q&A Count**: 4–6 (vs. 25–30 original) = **75–80% reduction**
- **Effort**: 4–6 hours (vs. 8–12 original) = **50% time savings**
- **References**: G≥8, T≥4, L≥4, A≥8 (vs. G≥15, T≥8, L≥8, A≥15)
- **Validation Checks**: 6 (vs. 15 original) = **60% streamlined**
- **Decision Criticality**: 100% of Q&As satisfy ≥1 criterion (Blocks/Risk/Stakeholders/Action/Quantified)

**Decision-Critical Scenarios**:
1. **Value Pool/Power Dynamics** (Q1–Q2): Blocks pricing/go-to-market decisions
2. **Disruption/Network Effects** (Q3–Q4): Creates competitive risk, identifies moat threats
3. **Margin Compression/Bottleneck** (Q5–Q6): Blocks resource allocation, identifies cost opportunities

**Execution**: Plan (1h) → References (1h) → Q&A (2–3h) → Visuals (30min) → Validate (30min)

**Result**: Minimal viable, decision-focused value chain analysis template enabling informed strategic decisions without information overload.
