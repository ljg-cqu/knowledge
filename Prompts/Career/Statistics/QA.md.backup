# Statistics Q&A Generator with Deep Understanding Framework

Generate 25–30 scenario-based questions testing statistical reasoning, application, and interpretation with evidence-based answers, visual artifacts, and evaluation materials that foster deep understanding.

## I. Context & Scope

**Purpose**: Develop comprehensive statistical understanding through multi-dimensional scenarios requiring methodological judgment, interpretation skills, and practical application across foundations to advanced topics.

**Assumptions**: LLM knows statistical frameworks (hypothesis testing, regression, experimental design, Bayesian inference, causal inference, distribution theory); user provides context or accepts generic datasets; text/visual output with worked examples; 10-20min per question for deep comprehension.

**Constraints**: 200-400 words/answer (excluding artifacts); ≥70% citation coverage (≥30% with ≥2 cites); 100% application-based (no rote memorization); progressive difficulty from foundational to advanced.

**Terms**: Q&A (scenario question–answer testing statistical reasoning), Floor (≥ = minimum threshold), Quality gate (mandatory checkpoint—fail = stop/fix), Difficulty (F=foundational concepts, I=intermediate application/interpretation, A=advanced inference/design), Dimensions (Mathematical/Applied/Interpretive/Computational).

**Scope**: Real-world data scenarios, methodological decisions, assumption validation, interpretation challenges, experimental design. **Exclude**: Pure mathematical proofs, cookbook procedures without understanding, programming syntax trivia, domain expertise without statistical reasoning.

**Limitations**: Generic datasets may lack domain context (customize per field); citation availability varies (≥50% foundational texts + recent applications); statistical methods require contextual judgment (include assumptions/limitations/robustness checks); computational examples focus on concepts (not specific software syntax).

**Example** (30): Foundations (5), Inference (6), Regression (6), Experimental Design (5), Multivariate (4), Applied (4) = 6F/12I/12A

## VII. Example

**Q1: A clinical trial with n=45 shows treatment mean improvement of 12 points (SD=8) vs. control mean of 8 points (SD=7). Two-sample t-test yields p=0.04, Cohen's d=0.53. The original power analysis assumed d=0.8 for n=40. How should you interpret these results and what additional analyses would strengthen the conclusion?**

**Difficulty**: I | **Topic**: Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing

**Key Statistical Insight**: Tests ability to distinguish statistical significance from practical significance, recognize underpowered studies, and recommend appropriate sensitivity analyses. The p=0.04 barely crosses α=0.05 threshold while effect size (d=0.53) falls short of design assumption (d=0.8), raising questions about robustness and clinical relevance.

**Answer** (378 words):

**Statistical Framework**: Use integrated evaluation combining significance testing, effect size estimation, power analysis, and robustness checks [Ref: L2, A3]. The dichotomous p-value interpretation is insufficient—examine confidence intervals, practical significance, and assumptions [Ref: A5].

**Multi-dimensional Analysis** (Interpretive/Applied/Computational):

**1. Statistical vs. Practical Significance**: p=0.04 indicates result unlikely under H₀, but marginal. Cohen's d=0.53 (medium effect) [Ref: G8] suggests moderate practical importance, but falls short of design target (d=0.8). Compute 95% CI for difference: (12-8) ± t₀.₀₂₅,₄₃ × SE ≈ 4 ± 2.02 × 2.28 ≈ (−0.6, 8.6). Interval includes 0 (barely), confirming marginal significance [Ref: G2].

**2. Power Analysis**: Observed d=0.53 with n=45 yields post-hoc power ≈ 0.45 [Ref: T1—GPower]. Study was underpowered for detecting true effect if d≈0.5. Original power calculation (d=0.8, n=40, power=0.80) was optimistic [Ref: A7].

**3. Assumptions Check** [Ref: G1]:
- **Normality**: With n=45, CLT applies if outliers minimal. Check Q-Q plots, Shapiro-Wilk test [Ref: T2—R shapiro.test()].
- **Equal variance**: Levene's test for homoscedasticity. If violated, use Welch's t-test (already robust).
- **Independence**: Verify randomization protocol; check for clustering/time trends.

**4. Robustness Checks**:
- **Permutation test**: Non-parametric alternative confirming p-value [Ref: L5].
- **Bootstrap CI**: Empirical confidence interval for difference [Ref: A9].
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Remove influential observations; reassess stability.

**Trade-offs**: (1) Strict α=0.05: Protects Type I error but ignores effect size; (2) Consider α=0.10: Increases power but higher false positives; (3) Bayesian approach: Incorporates prior information, provides probability statements [Ref: L7, G11]; (4) Equivalence testing: Test if difference is practically negligible [Ref: A11].

**Software Implementation** [Ref: T2]: R code—`t.test(treatment, control, var.equal=FALSE)`, `pwr.t.test(d=0.53, n=45)`, `qqnorm()`, `leveneTest()`.

**Recommendation**: Report results with caution. State: "Treatment shows moderate improvement (d=0.53, 95% CI: [−0.6, 8.6], p=0.04), but study was underpowered. Replicate with n≥70 for 80% power at d=0.5. Consider Bayesian analysis to incorporate prior evidence."

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Interpreting p=0.04 as "proof" of effect (ignore effect size, CI, power)
- Post-hoc power analysis for observed effect (circular reasoning) [Ref: A13]
- Ignoring assumption violations with moderate n

**Artifact**:

| Analysis Component      | Result         | Interpretation                          | Action                           |
|-------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| p-value                 | 0.04           | Marginal significance (barely < 0.05)   | Report with caution              |
| Effect size (Cohen's d) | 0.53           | Medium effect, below design (0.8)       | Acknowledge discrepancy          |
| 95% CI for difference   | (−0.6, 8.6)    | Includes 0; wide interval               | Highlight uncertainty            |
| Post-hoc power          | ~0.45          | Underpowered (< 0.80)                   | Recommend replication            |
| Normality (Shapiro-Wilk)| p > 0.05 (assumed) | No evidence of violation            | Proceed with t-test              |
| Equal variance (Levene) | p > 0.05 (assumed) | Homoscedastic                       | Standard or Welch's t-test OK    |

**Confidence**: High (standard inference scenario requiring integrated evaluation)
