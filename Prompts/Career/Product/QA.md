# PM Interview Q&A Generator

**Purpose**: Generate 8-10 scenario-based questions for senior PM interviews, focusing on judgment under uncertainty to improve hiring decisions.

**Scope**: Senior+ PM roles; decision-critical scenarios (revenue >$1M impact, strategic pivots, churn >5%); stakeholder navigation and trade-offs; 100% scenario-based.

**Constraints**: 150-250 words/answer; ≥70% answers with citations; 100% decision-critical; senior+ level.

**Assumptions**: Industry context provided or generic accepted; text output; ≈10-15min discussion per question.

**Focus**: Stakeholder tension, resource constraints, strategic ambiguity. **Exclude**: Trivia, greenfield design, junior tasks, technical questions.

**Limitations**: Generic scenarios may lack industry nuance; citations vary in recency; frameworks need contextual application.

**Terms**:
- **Q&A**: Scenario question-answer pair testing judgment.
- **Floor**: Minimum threshold (meeting ≥ value = pass).
- **Quality Gate**: Mandatory checkpoint (fail = stop/fix).
- **Difficulty**: F=execution, I=strategy/trade-offs, A=portfolio/vision/P&L.
- **Dimensions**: Different lenses (e.g., metrics, users, stakeholders, risk, time).
- **Decision-Critical**: Scenario meeting ≥1 criterion: blocks decisions, creates risk, affects ≥2 stakeholders, actively evolving, quantified impact.

## Requirements

### Decision Criticality Framework

Include scenarios meeting ≥1 criterion:
- Blocks decisions (roadmap prioritization, go/no-go, strategic pivot with >$1M revenue impact)
- Creates risk (competitive threat, >5% churn, strategic misalignment)
- Affects ≥2 stakeholders (multi-team impact)
- Actively evolving (dynamics changing in past 3-6 months)
- Quantified impact (revenue, adoption, retention metrics)

### Quantitative Floors

- Q&A: 8-10 total, balanced mix (more intermediate difficulty), 150-250 words/answer, ≥70% with ≥1 citation, each answer covers ≥2 dimensions.
- Topics: Strategy & Prioritization (2-3), Metrics & Decision-Making (2-3), Stakeholder Alignment (1-2), optional GTM (1).
- References: Glossary ≥8 terms, Tools ≥3, Literature ≥4 (≥1 ZH), Citations ≥6 APA 7th with language tags.
- Visuals: ≥1 diagram + table per topic.

### Citation Standards

- Format: APA 7th + language tag (e.g., [EN]). Inline: [Ref: ID] (G#=Glossary, T#=Tool, L#=Literature, A#=Citation).
- Distribution: Aim for ~50-70% EN, 20-40% ZH, 5-15% other (flexible as long as multi-language and relevant).
- Types: ≥3 (frameworks, research, case studies, tools).

### Quality Gates

Fail any = stop, fix, re-validate:
1. Recency: At least ~40% of references from the last 5 years; prefer newer sources for fast-moving domains (e.g., AI/ML/data).
2. Diversity: ≥3 citation types; no single type dominates (>50%).
3. Evidence: Each topic ≥2 authoritative + ≥1 tool.
4. Tools: Where available, include pricing model, indicative users, recent update, and key integrations.
5. References: Links accessible/archived.
6. Cross-refs & coherence: 100% [Ref: ID] resolve (no orphans), and Q&A set, references, visuals, and example stay consistent with this PM interview template's purpose.

## Execution

1. **Plan Allocation**: Select 8-10 Q&A across 3-4 topics (Strategy & Prioritization 2-3, Metrics & Decision-Making 2-3, Stakeholder Alignment 1-2, optional GTM 1). Aim for balanced difficulty mix (more intermediate).

2. **Build References**: Create Glossary (≥8 terms), Tools (≥3), Literature (≥4, ≥1 ZH), Citations (≥6 APA 7th). Run Quality Gates 1-5 now (run 6 after cross-refs and Q&A are in place).

3. **Generate Q&A**: Create scenario questions testing ≥2 judgment signals. Answers: 150-250 words, key insight, framework [Ref], ≥2 dimensions, steps, trade-offs, communication, criteria, citations. Self-check batches.

4. **Create Visuals**: ≥1 diagram + table per topic. Reference in ≥50% answers.

5. **Populate References**: Format as specified. Ensure 100% cross-refs resolve.

6. **Validate**: Run checks (floors, citations, criticality, language, recency, links, cross-refs, word count, insights, coverage, frameworks, judgment). Fail any = fix.

7. **Final Review**: Ensure questions are clear, realistic, discriminative. Answers balanced with trade-offs. All validations pass.

## Success Criteria

- Interview Quality: ≥80% elicit judgment (baseline 50% trivia)
- Hiring Accuracy: ≥70% show senior judgment in 6mo (baseline 40%)
- Time: 30s check, 10-15min discussion
- Citations: ≥70% of answers with ≥1 citation
- Impact: 100% ≥$1M revenue/strategic

Target: Reduce hiring risk by 60% via structured evaluations.

## Question Quality

Review each; rewrite if fails ≥2:
1. Clarity: Single ask (e.g., "Prioritize activation vs. churn?")
2. Signal: Tests judgment (scenario-based)
3. Depth: Enables trade-offs (alternatives)
4. Realism: Senior PM (complex constraints)
5. Discriminative: Application over recall ("When can RICE mislead?" vs. "What is RICE?")
6. Alignment: Difficulty fits seniority (F execution, I trade-offs, A vision/P&L)

## Example

**Q1: How do you evaluate building a feature requested by top 5 enterprise customers (40% revenue) that doesn't align with product vision for the mass market?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Strategy & Prioritization

**Key Insight**: Tests revenue protection (enterprise retention) vs. long-term PMF (mass-market scalability); distinguishes PMs navigating executive pressure from those defaulting to pleasing customers or rigid vision adherence.

**Answer** (248 words):

Use multi-dimensional evaluation [Ref: A1]. **First, discover JTBD** [Ref: A7]—what problem are customers solving? Surface requests often mask deeper needs revealing generalized solutions [Ref: A6].

**Second, quantify with RICE** [Ref: G2]. Enterprise: Reach (5/$2M), Impact (high retention/low acquisition), Confidence (high), Effort (unknown if custom). Mass-market: Reach (5K+ users), Impact (med/user, high cumulative), Confidence (med), Effort (similar). RICE won't capture strategic value—use decision matrix [Ref: T2].

**Third, assess against North Star** [Ref: G4]. Does this move toward outcomes or become feature factory [Ref: G9]? If generalized ("custom fields" → "flexible schema"), both segments benefit and strengthen PMF [Ref: G5].

**Trade-offs**: (1) Enterprise version: protects $2M but risks fragmentation/debt; (2) Generalized version: serves both but longer timeline/higher uncertainty; (3) Decline: maintains vision but risks churn/competition; (4) Premium tier: monetizes customization but adds operational complexity.

**Alternatives**: Professional services, partner ecosystem, configuration tools [Ref: L3].

**Stakeholder communication**: Present analysis with recommendation, trade-offs, criteria, precedent implications—product principles matter [Ref: T2].

**Success criteria**: If built, measure enterprise retention (+20%), mass-market adoption (≥30% use within 6mo), tech debt (≤10% velocity impact), support costs (flat/declining).

**Limitations**: Assumes enterprise needs are generalizable; may not apply if truly custom.

**Artifact**:

| Criterion           | Enterprise       | Mass Market      | Weight | E Score | M Score |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Revenue (12mo)      | $2M (retention)  | $500K (acquisition) | 30%  | 9       | 3       |
| Strategic alignment | Low (custom)     | High (vision)    | 25%    | 2       | 9       |
| Reach               | 5 customers      | 5K+ users        | 20%    | 1       | 9       |
| Velocity impact     | High (complex)   | Low (reusable)   | 15%    | 2       | 8       |
| Competitive moat    | Low (replicable) | High (differentiator) | 10% | 3    | 9       |
| **Weighted**        |                  |                  |        | **4.8** | **7.1** |

**Recommendation**: Generalized mass-market feature + enterprise premium services for edge cases

**Confidence**: High (established frameworks; common PM dilemma)
