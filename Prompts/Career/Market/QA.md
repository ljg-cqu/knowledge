## Examples

### F (20%): Explain + Apply
**Q**: What is STP and when is it used?  
**A** (~150w): STP [Ref: G1] has 3 stages: (1) Segmentation divides markets by needs/behaviors; (2) Targeting selects segments by fit; (3) Positioning defines brand perception vs. competitors [Ref: L1]. Use for market entry, launches, rebranding in fragmented markets. **Limitations**: Assumes stable segments—fails in rapidly evolving markets or micro-segmentation [Ref: L4]. Requires research investment. Segments must be measurable, accessible, substantial, actionable.

### I (40%): Diagnose + Apply Multiple
**Q**: B2B SaaS: CAC $1,200, LTV $3,800 (3.2:1). Assess mid-market expansion feasibility.  
**A** (~180w): Current 3.2:1 is healthy [Ref: G5]. Mid-market needs ≥3:1. Variables: (1) CAC increases (longer cycles, multiple buyers) [Ref: A11]; (2) LTV increases (higher ARPU, lower churn) [Ref: G5]. **Approach**: Benchmark with ChartMogul [Ref: T3]; pilot 20 accounts, 3 months [Ref: L5]; track CAC, conversion, cycle, ACV, churn; model 12-mo LTV. **Decision**: Proceed if LTV:CAC ≥3:1, payback <18mo. **Limitations**: Needs different positioning [Ref: G1], sales infrastructure, product capabilities—CAC alone insufficient. Pilot may have selection bias [Ref: L5].

### A (40%): Synthesize + Justify
**Q**: $10M budget, awareness -8pts YoY, ROAS +15% YoY. CEO wants "more performance." Respond.  
**A** (~280w): Performance cannibalizes brand—"efficiency trap" [Ref: L4, A10]. Declining awareness shrinks funnel; performance captures demand but doesn't create it [Ref: L4]. ROAS gains reflect last-click bias over-crediting bottom-funnel [Ref: G6, A12]. **Response**: "ROAS unsustainable. Harvesting equity faster than building. Propose 60/40 brand/performance [Ref: L4, A10] per econometric models." **Strategy**: (1) Q1-Q2: Reallocate 20% ($2M) to brand (video, sponsorships, content) [Ref: L3]; brand lift studies [Ref: T1]; geo holdouts [Ref: A11]; (2) Q3-Q4: Campaign for +5pts awareness; MMM [Ref: G6]; (3) Year 2: Optimize to 60/40. **Alternative**: 100% performance if prioritizing market share—risks commoditization [Ref: L5]. **When NOT**: Early-stage pre-PMF [Ref: L5]. **Limitations**: Brand lags 6–18mo [Ref: L4]; ROAS dips -10-20% Q1-Q2; MMM has 10-20% error [Ref: A12].

## Complete Example

**Q**: How determine optimal channel mix when CAC +45% YoY, LTV:CAC dropped 4.5:1 → 2.8:1?

**Difficulty**: A | **Domain**: Metrics & Analytics, Channels  
**Key Insight**: Tests efficiency deterioration diagnosis; distinguishes holistic optimizers from metric chasers.

**Answer** (285w):  
**Context**: CAC +45%, LTV:CAC 4.5:1→2.8:1 signals unit economics deterioration—critical growth threat [Ref: G2, G3].

**Analysis**: Root causes [Ref: A11]: (1) Declining lead quality (higher churn, lower LTV), (2) Channel saturation (shrinking audience, higher CPM/CPC), (3) Competition (bidding wars). Decompose by channel/cohort [Ref: T1, T2].

**Reasoning**: MTA [Ref: G6] reveals true contribution vs. last-click bias over-crediting bottom-funnel [Ref: A12, T1]. Calculate channel LTV:CAC; healthy ≥3:1 [Ref: L1, G3]. Distinguishes efficient vs. saturated [Ref: A10]. MMM [Ref: G7] captures offline/brand effects.

**Recommendations**: 3-phase [Ref: L2]: (1) M1: Pause/cut 30–50% on LTV:CAC <2:1; reallocate to ≥3:1. (2) M2-M3: Test new channels (partnerships, community, referral, organic) [Ref: G9, L3]; pilot 10% budget. (3) M4-M6: Improve conversion (CRO) [Ref: T1]; increase LTV (retention, upsell) [Ref: T2, T4]. MMM [Ref: G7] simulates scenarios.

**Implementation**: Channel dashboard [Ref: T1] (CAC, LTV, payback, margin by cohort); weekly reviews 3mo, then monthly. CFO approval for 10–15% revenue dip M1-M2.

**Metrics**: CAC $200 (−23%), LTV:CAC 4.0:1 (+43%), payback <12mo, 3-yr ROI ≥300%.

**When NOT**: If strategic up-market (higher ARPU justifies higher CAC) [Ref: G3] or land-grab phase prioritizing share.

**Limitations**: Attribution has biases—no perfect causality [Ref: G6, A12]. MTA undervalues brand; MMM 10–20% error, needs 18–24mo data. External factors (seasonality, macro, competition) confound. Rapid shifts risk momentum loss, undervalue long-term brand [Ref: L4, A10]. Needs 3–6mo + exec buy-in.
