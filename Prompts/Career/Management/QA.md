# Project Management Interview Q&A Generator

Generate 25–30 scenario-based questions testing senior+ (5-15 yrs) project management judgment with evidence-based answers and visual artifacts.

## I. Context

**Purpose**: Assess senior/director/VP judgment through multi-dimensional scenarios requiring stakeholder navigation and strategic trade-offs.

**Scope**: Stakeholder tension, resource constraints, strategic ambiguity, schedule pressure, budget limitations. **Exclude**: Trivia, theory, junior tasks, domain-specific technical questions.

**Terms**: Floor (≥ minimum threshold), Gate (mandatory checkpoint—fail = stop/fix), Difficulty (F=execution, I=strategy/trade-offs, A=portfolio/program/organization), Dimensions (Planning/Execution/Risk/Stakeholder).

**Assumptions**: LLM knows PM frameworks (PMBOK, PRINCE2, Agile, CPM, EVM, Risk, Change, Portfolio Management); user provides context or accepts generic scenarios; 10-15min discussion/question.

**Constraints**: 150-300 words/answer (excluding artifacts); ≥70% have ≥1 citation (≥30% have ≥2); 100% scenario-based; senior+ only.

**Limitations**: Generic scenarios lack industry nuance; ≥50% citations from last 3yrs; include framework trade-offs/limitations; add qualitative review to quantitative validation.

### Step 2: Build References (before Q&A → run Gates 1–6 after)
**Glossary (≥10)**: PM frameworks (CPM, EVM, WBS, RACI, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Risk Matrix, Change Control, Stakeholder Analysis) | Format: term, definition (1–2 sentences), use cases, related, limitations | Assign G1, G2...

**Answer** (150–300 words):
1. Key insight (1 sentence): Specific dilemma/tension
2. Framework/approach [Ref: G#/A#]
3. Multi-dimensional (≥2 dimensions)
4. Concrete steps
5. Trade-offs + alternatives
6. Stakeholder communication
7. Success criteria
8. Citations (≥1 [Ref: ID])
9. Artifact (optional): Matrix, Gantt, dashboard, RACI

**Batch Check** (per 5): Scenario-based | ≥2 signals | 150–300 words | Concrete insight | ≥2 dimensions | ≥3/5 have ≥1 citation (≥1/5 has ≥2) | Difficulty matches content

### Step 4: Create Visuals (≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic)
**Planning**: Gantt chart, network diagram, decision matrix | **Resources**: Resource histogram, budget variance | **Risk**: Risk matrix, impact/probability chart | **Stakeholder**: Power/interest grid, RACI matrix | **Execution**: Milestone tracker, burndown chart | **Portfolio**: Portfolio roadmap, prioritization matrix

### Step 5: Populate References

## V. Question Quality (fails ≥2 = rewrite/replace)

1. **Clarity**: Single ask | ✓ "3 stakeholders want conflicting features—how prioritize?" | ✗ "Explain Agile + Waterfall + risk management"
2. **Signal**: Tests judgment | ✓ "CEO demands 50% faster delivery—approach?" | ✗ "List PMBOK knowledge areas"
3. **Depth**: Enables trade-offs | ✓ "Choose: cut scope, add resources, or delay—how decide?" | ✗ "Should we use Gantt charts?"
4. **Realism**: Senior+ PM | ✓ "CTO wants replatform mid-project ($2M budget spent). What do?" | ✗ "Create project charter"
5. **Discriminative**: Application not recall | ✓ "When would CPM mislead? How supplement?" | ✗ "What is Critical Path Method?"

## VII. Example

**Q1: Major client demands feature mid-project that requires 30% budget increase and 2-month delay. Contract renewal ($5M) depends on delivery. Project already 15% over budget. What do?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Portfolio & Program

**Key Insight**: Tests portfolio-level judgment balancing strategic revenue, scope/budget control, and stakeholder expectations under executive pressure.

**Answer** (247 words):

Use multi-dimensional impact analysis [Ref: A1]. **First, quantify trade-offs** using decision matrix [Ref: G2]. Baseline vs. 3 scenarios: (1) Accept change (+$1.5M/+2mo): secures $5M but sets precedent, impacts other projects; (2) Negotiate scope reduction: delivers core capability, preserves timeline/budget; (3) Decline: risks $5M revenue, preserves portfolio integrity.

**Second, assess portfolio impact** [Ref: G6]. Are other projects resource-constrained? Does delay cascade? Use portfolio roadmap [Ref: T3] to model ripple effects. If 30% increase means deferring 2 other initiatives, calculate opportunity cost [Ref: A4].

**Third, evaluate with EVM** [Ref: G3]. Current CPI=0.87 (15% over). Adding scope worsens performance baseline. Will this become pattern? Use Risk Matrix [Ref: G8] to assess: client satisfaction (high impact/high probability) vs. portfolio health (high impact/medium probability).

**Trade-offs**: (1) Accept: revenue secured but precedent/portfolio impact; (2) Negotiate: balanced but requires skilled stakeholder management; (3) Decline: maintains control but revenue risk; (4) Phase delivery: spreads cost/timeline but adds complexity [Ref: L2].

**Stakeholder communication**: Present analysis to steering committee with recommendation, quantified impacts, risk mitigation. Escalate decision—program-level authority required [Ref: A5].

**Success criteria**: Revenue retained, portfolio velocity maintained (±10%), precedent managed (change control enforced), stakeholder satisfaction (CSAT ≥80%).

**Artifact**:

| Scenario | Revenue Risk | Budget Impact | Schedule Impact | Portfolio Impact | Risk Score | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Accept Change | Low ($5M secured) | High (+30%) | High (+2mo) | High (cascades) | 7.5/10 | No |
| Negotiate Scope | Medium ($5M likely) | Low (±5%) | Low (±2wk) | Low (minimal) | 4.2/10 | **Yes** |
| Decline | High ($5M at risk) | None | None | None | 8.5/10 | No |
| Phase Delivery | Medium ($5M partial) | Medium (+15%) | Medium (+1mo) | Medium (partial) | 6.0/10 | Maybe |
