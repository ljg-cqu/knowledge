# Project Management Q&A (Decision-Critical)

Generate 6–12 decision-critical Q&As for project management scenarios—minimal viable set for informed decisions with limited time.

## I. Context

**Purpose**: Address only decision-critical management scenarios (constraints, risks, stakeholder dynamics) that block decisions or create material risk.

**Scope**: Portfolio prioritization, budget variance, stakeholder escalation, risk materialization, resource bottlenecks, schedule slips, scope creep, team morale. **Exclude**: Trivia, theory, generic best practices, niche/legacy practices (<5% adoption).

**Terms**: Decision Criticality (≥1 criterion: Blocks decision, Creates risk, Affects ≥2 stakeholders, Actively evolving, High adoption barrier >40h), Minimal Viable (6-12 Q&As sufficient for informed judgment), Pareto Principle (20% of scenarios drive 80% of PM decisions).

**Assumptions**: LLM knows PM frameworks (PMBOK, PRINCE2, Agile, EVM, Risk, Change, Portfolio); user provides context; 5-10min per question.

**Constraints**: 150-250 words/answer; ≥70% have ≥1 citation; 100% scenario-based; decision-critical only.

**Limitations**: Generic scenarios lack industry nuance; ≥50% citations from last 2yrs; include framework trade-offs; add qualitative review.

## II. Requirements (Minimal Viable)

**Q&A**: 6–12 total | 25%F/50%I/25%A (±5%) | 150–250 words | ≥70% have ≥1 citation (≥40% have ≥2) | Decision-critical only

**Topics (Decision-Critical)**: 1. Portfolio & Prioritization (1–2) | 2. Budget & Variance (1–2) | 3. Risk & Escalation (1–2) | 4. Stakeholder Dynamics (1–2) | 5. Resource Constraints (1–2) | 6. Team & Morale (1–2)

**Decision Criticality Framework**: Include if ≥1 criterion met:
- **Blocks Decision**: Directly impacts go/no-go, resource allocation, or strategic pivot
- **Creates Risk**: Material threat (financial, operational, reputational, schedule)
- **Affects ≥2 Stakeholders**: Multi-team impact (e.g., PM + Exec, Dev Lead + Finance)
- **Actively Evolving**: Management/org dynamics changing in past 3-6 months
- **High Adoption Barrier**: >40h to implement/learn

## III. Execution (Minimal Viable)

### Step 1: Plan Allocation
Distribute 6–12 across 6 topics (25%F/50%I/25%A). Each topic: 1–2 Q&A, all decision-critical.

### Step 2: Build References (before Q&A → run Gates 1–6 after)
**Glossary (≥8)**: PM frameworks (EVM, RACI, Risk Matrix, Change Control, Stakeholder Analysis, Portfolio, Prioritization, Escalation) | Format: term, definition (1–2 sentences), use cases, limitations | Assign G1, G2...

**Tools (≥4)**: Scheduling (MS Project, Jira), Collaboration (Asana, Slack) | Include: category, pricing, users, PM use case, URL | Assign T1, T2...

**Literature (≥4)**: EN—PMI (*PMBOK Guide*), Kerzner (*Project Management*) | ZH (≥1)—PM-focused Chinese title | Include: author, title, year, summary, frameworks | Assign L1, L2...

**Citations (≥8)**: APA 7th + tags | Verify ≥50% from last 2yrs | Classify: frameworks/research/case studies | Assign A1, A2...

### Step 3: Generate Q&A (2–3 at a time → self-check)
**Question**: Scenario format ("How would you...", "Walk me through...", "CEO wants X—what do?") | Include constraints (time, resources, stakeholder pressure) | Test ≥2 judgment signals (trade-offs, stakeholder tension, incomplete info) | Single ask | **Avoid**: "What is X?", "List Y", "Define Z"

**Answer** (150–250 words):
1. Key insight (1 sentence): Specific dilemma/tension
2. Framework/approach [Ref: G#/A#]
3. Multi-dimensional (≥2 dimensions)
4. Concrete steps
5. Trade-offs + alternatives
6. Stakeholder communication
7. Citations (≥1 [Ref: ID])
8. Artifact (optional): Matrix, decision tree, dashboard

**Batch Check** (per 2–3): Scenario-based | Decision-critical ✓ | 150–250 words | Concrete insight | ≥2 dimensions | ≥2/3 have ≥1 citation | Difficulty matches content

### Step 4: Create Visuals (≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic)
**Portfolio**: Decision matrix, prioritization grid | **Budget**: Budget variance chart, EVM dashboard | **Risk**: Risk matrix, impact/probability chart | **Stakeholder**: Power/interest grid, RACI matrix | **Resource**: Resource histogram, bottleneck chart | **Team**: Morale/velocity trend, escalation tree

### Step 5: Populate References
**Glossary**: **G#. Term (Acronym)** | Definition | Use cases | Limitations | Alphabetize

**Tools**: **T#. Tool (Category)** | Description | Pricing | Users | PM use case | URL | Group by category

**Literature**: **L#. Author, Title, Year** | Summary | Relevance | Group by language (EN, then ZH)

**Citations**: **A#. [Citation] [Lang]** | APA 7th format | Sort by ID

## V. Question Quality (fails ≥2 = rewrite/replace)

1. **Clarity**: Single ask | ✓ "3 stakeholders want conflicting features—how prioritize?" | ✗ "Explain Agile + Waterfall + risk management"
2. **Signal**: Tests judgment | ✓ "CEO demands 50% faster delivery—approach?" | ✗ "List PMBOK knowledge areas"
3. **Depth**: Enables trade-offs | ✓ "Choose: cut scope, add resources, or delay—how decide?" | ✗ "Should we use Gantt charts?"
4. **Realism**: Senior+ PM | ✓ "CTO wants replatform mid-project ($2M budget spent). What do?" | ✗ "Create project charter"
5. **Discriminative**: Application not recall | ✓ "When would CPM mislead? How supplement?" | ✗ "What is Critical Path Method?"
6. **Alignment**: Difficulty matches seniority | F: execution | I: strategy/trade-offs | A: portfolio/program/organization

## VII. Minimal Viable Example

**Q1: Major client demands feature mid-project requiring 30% budget increase and 2-month delay. Contract renewal ($5M) depends on delivery. Project already 15% over budget. What do?**

**Difficulty**: I | **Topic**: Portfolio & Prioritization | **Decision Criticality**: Blocks decision (go/no-go), Affects stakeholders (Exec, PM, Client)

**Key Insight**: Tests judgment balancing strategic revenue, scope/budget control, and stakeholder expectations under executive pressure.

**Answer** (220 words):

**Framework**: Use multi-dimensional impact analysis [Ref: A1]. **Quantify trade-offs** using decision matrix [Ref: G2]. Baseline vs. 3 scenarios: (1) Accept (+$1.5M/+2mo): secures $5M but sets precedent; (2) Negotiate scope: delivers core, preserves timeline/budget; (3) Decline: risks $5M, preserves portfolio.

**Portfolio impact** [Ref: G6]: Does delay cascade? Use portfolio roadmap to model ripple effects. If 30% increase defers 2 other initiatives, calculate opportunity cost [Ref: A4].

**EVM assessment** [Ref: G3]: Current CPI=0.87 (15% over). Adding scope worsens baseline. Use Risk Matrix [Ref: G8]: client satisfaction (high/high) vs. portfolio health (high/medium).

**Trade-offs**: Accept (revenue secured, precedent risk) | Negotiate (balanced, requires stakeholder skill) | Decline (control maintained, revenue risk).

**Stakeholder communication**: Present analysis to steering committee with quantified impacts and risk mitigation. Escalate—program-level authority required [Ref: A5].

**Success criteria**: Revenue retained, portfolio velocity ±10%, precedent managed, CSAT ≥80%.

**Artifact**:

| Scenario | Revenue Risk | Budget Impact | Portfolio Impact | Risk Score | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Accept Change | Low ($5M secured) | High (+30%) | High (cascades) | 7.5/10 | No |
| Negotiate Scope | Medium ($5M likely) | Low (±5%) | Low (minimal) | 4.2/10 | **Yes** |
| Decline | High ($5M at risk) | None | None | 8.5/10 | No |
