## V. Example

**Q1: Trace product prioritization framework evolution from 1990s to today. What drove major shifts and where is it heading?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Prioritization & Roadmapping

**Key Insight**: Frameworks evolved engineering-centric (MoSCoW) → value-centric (RICE/WSJF) → outcome-centric (North Star/OST), driven by faster release cycles, data availability, market competition.

**Answer** (268 words):

**Origin Context** [Ref: A3]: Pre-2000s prioritization was engineering-driven (MoSCoW 1994, Clegg [Ref: G7], cost-benefit analysis)—reflecting waterfall constraints where changing priorities was expensive [Ref: L5].

**Early Evolution (2000-2010)**: Agile adoption created continuous prioritization need [Ref: A8]. RICE emerged at Intercom (~2016) [Ref: G2] codifying reach/impact/confidence/effort—shift toward quantification as SaaS enabled faster iteration/A/B testing [Ref: T1]. Kano model (1984, popularized 2000s) introduced customer satisfaction dimension [Ref: A2].

**Middle Period (2010-2018)**: Data explosion drove weighted scoring (WSJF from SAFe 2011 [Ref: G8], ICE ~2008 [Ref: G10]). Prioritization shifted "what can we build?" → "what should we build?" [Ref: L2]. PLG emergence (~2016) [Ref: A9] emphasized activation/retention metrics.

**Current State (2018-2025)**: Shift toward outcome-based frameworks—North Star (Amplitude 2018) [Ref: G4], Opportunity Solution Trees (Torres 2021) [Ref: G9], RICE variations. Discovery-driven prioritization replaced roadmap-first [Ref: L4]. AI/ML enabling predictive impact scoring [Ref: A11].

**Trend Analysis**: Moving toward (1) real-time reprioritization using live data; (2) customer outcome proxies over feature delivery; (3) probabilistic frameworks acknowledging uncertainty; (4) AI-assisted prioritization [Ref: A12].

**Driving Forces**: Release frequency (yearly → daily), data availability (intuition → metrics), market velocity (first-mover → fast-follower), customer expectations (features → outcomes).

**Implications**: Future PMs need (1) historical framework knowledge for tool selection; (2) data literacy for quantitative prioritization; (3) outcome over feature thinking; (4) comfort with continuous reprioritization.

**Artifact**:

| Era       | Framework | Driver                    | Cycle Time | Decision Basis |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|
| 1990-2000 | MoSCoW/CBA| Waterfall constraints     | 12-24mo    | Engineering cost |
| 2000-2010 | Kano/Value-Effort | Agile adoption    | 3-6mo      | Customer value |
| 2010-2018 | RICE/WSJF/ICE | Data availability     | 2-4wk      | Quantified impact |
| 2018-2025 | North Star/OST | PLG/Outcomes focus   | Continuous | Customer outcomes |
| 2025+     | AI-assisted/Real-time | Predictive analytics | Real-time | Predicted outcomes |
