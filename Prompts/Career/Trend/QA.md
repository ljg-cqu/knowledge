## III. Execution

### Step 1: Plan Allocation

Distribute 25–30 across 6 topics (20%F/40%I/40%A). Each: 4–6 Q&A with ≥1F, ≥1I, ≥1A.

**Example** (30): Strategy (5), Discovery (5), Prioritization (6), Metrics (5), Stakeholder (4), GTM (5) = 6F/12I/12A

- **Alternative sources**: Gartner (trend), Forrester (wave history), Lenny's Newsletter (evolution), Product Coalition (retrospectives), HBR (case studies), MIT Sloan (academic), **PM journals, conference archives, company blogs (origin stories)**

### Step 3: Generate Q&A (5 at a time → self-check each batch)

**Question**: 
- Origin/History/Trend format: "How did X evolve?", "Why was Y created?", "What trends led to Z?", "Where is W heading?"
- Include temporal scope: specific timeframes, evolution phases, inflection points, emerging patterns
- Test ≥2 temporal signals: origin context, evolution drivers, paradigm shifts, trend forecasting, pattern recognition
- Single ask; **avoid**: current tactical decisions, hypothetical scenarios, "What would you do if..."

**Difficulty**: 
- F=recent trends (5yr): "How has PLG adoption changed since 2020?"
- I=evolution (10-15yr): "Trace the evolution from waterfall to agile to continuous delivery in PM practice"
- A=origins/paradigm shifts (20+yr): "Why did PM emerge as distinct from engineering? How has the role fundamentally changed?"

**Answer Structure** (150–300 words):
1. Key Insight (1 sentence): Core temporal pattern/inflection point
2. Origin Context [Ref: G#/A#]: Why created, initial problem solved, creator/timeframe
3. Evolution Timeline (≥2 temporal dimensions): Key milestones, paradigm shifts, adoption curve, market forces
4. Current State: Present usage, maturity level, mainstream adoption
5. Trend Analysis: Emerging patterns, future projections, successor approaches
6. Driving Forces: Technology changes, market dynamics, user behavior shifts
7. Implications: What this means for PM practice today/tomorrow
8. Citations (≥1 [Ref: ID]; prioritize historical + trend sources)
9. Artifact (optional): Timeline, evolution diagram, adoption curve, trend projection

**Batch Self-Check**: Origin/history/trend-focused | Tests ≥2 temporal signals | 150–300 words | Concrete temporal insight | ≥2 temporal dimensions | ≥3/5 have ≥1 cite (≥1/5 has ≥2) | Difficulty matches timeframe

### Step 4: Create Visuals (≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic; reference from ≥50% answers)

- **Strategy**: Timeline of strategy frameworks (1960s-now), paradigm shift diagram, evolution of PM role
- **Discovery**: Evolution of research methods timeline, adoption curve comparison
- **Prioritization**: Framework origin/evolution table, RICE→ICE→WSJF timeline
- **Metrics**: AARRR emergence (2007), funnel evolution, metric framework timeline
- **Stakeholder**: Stakeholder management evolution, org structure changes over time
- **GTM**: PLG adoption curve (2015-2025), GTM model evolution, channel shift timeline

**Best Practices**: Timelines for evolution; tables for comparative historical data; include specific years/eras; cite historical sources

### Step 5: Populate References

- **Glossary**: **G#. Term (Acronym)** | Definition | **Origin year, creator** | Evolution milestones | Current usage | Related | Limitations | Alphabetize
- **Tools**: **T#. Tool (Category)** | Description | **Launch year** | Adoption timeline | Market evolution | Predecessor tools | URL | Group by category
- **Literature**: **L#. Author, Title, Year** | **Historical context** | Summary (focus/frameworks) | **Influence/legacy** | Relevance | Group by language (EN, then ≥2 ZH)
- **Citations**: **A#. [Citation] [Lang]** | APA 7th format | **Type (historical/trend/foundational)** | Sort by ID

**Check**: 100% [Ref: ID] resolve | No orphans | All fields complete | All APA have tags | **Temporal balance verified**

### Step 6: Run 12 Validations (fail ANY = stop, fix, re-run ALL)

1. **Floors**: G≥10, T≥5, L≥6, A≥12, Q=25–30, 20%F/40%I/40%A (±5%)
2. **Citations**: ≥70% have ≥1; ≥30% have ≥2
3. **Language**: EN 50–70%, ZH 20–40%, Other 5–15%
4. **Temporal Balance**: ≥30% historical + ≥40% trend + ≥20% foundational sources
5. **Source Types**: ≥3 types; no type >25%
6. **Links**: 100% accessible/archived
7. **Cross-Refs**: 100% [Ref: ID] resolve; no orphans
8. **Word Count**: Sample 5; 100% within 150–300
9. **Key Insights**: 100% concrete (specific temporal pattern/inflection point)
10. **Per-Topic Evidence**: 6/6 topics have ≥1 historical + ≥1 trend + ≥1 foundational
11. **Framework Usage**: ≥80% include origin context + evolution + current state + cited
12. **Temporal Focus**: ≥70% origin/history/trend-focused

### Step 7: Final Review

**Questions**: Clarity (single ask) | Signal (temporal understanding not trivia) | Depth (evolution/trends) | Realism (senior+ PM knowledge) | Discriminative (pattern recognition over recall) | Alignment (difficulty matches timeframe)

**Answers** (sample ≥5): ≥2 temporal dimensions | Origin/evolution/trend with cites | Explicit driving forces/inflection points | Historical evidence | Future implications | Acknowledges uncertainty/limitations

**Submission**: All 12 validations PASS | All 6 gates passed | TOC with links | No placeholders | Consistent formatting | Balanced perspectives (historical accuracy vs. trend projection, technology-driven vs. market-driven, evolution vs. revolution)

## VII. Example

**Q1: Trace the evolution of product prioritization frameworks from the 1990s to today. What drove the major shifts and where is prioritization heading?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Prioritization & Roadmapping

**Key Insight**: Prioritization frameworks evolved from engineering-centric (Waterfall/MoSCoW) → value-centric (RICE/WSJF) → outcome-centric (North Star/OST), driven by faster release cycles, data availability, and market competition; distinguishes PMs understanding historical context from those following current trends without foundational knowledge.

**Answer** (268 words):

**Origin Context** [Ref: A3]: Pre-2000s prioritization was engineering-driven using MoSCoW (1994, Clegg) [Ref: G7] and cost-benefit analysis—reflecting waterfall constraints where changing priorities was expensive [Ref: L5].

**Early Evolution (2000-2010)**: Agile adoption created need for continuous prioritization [Ref: A8]. RICE emerged at Intercom (~2016) [Ref: G2] codifying reach/impact/confidence/effort—shift toward quantification as SaaS enabled faster iteration and A/B testing [Ref: T1]. Kano model (1984, but popularized 2000s) introduced customer satisfaction dimension [Ref: A2].

**Middle Period (2010-2018)**: Data explosion drove weighted scoring (WSJF from SAFe 2011) [Ref: G8] and ICE (Sean Ellis ~2008) [Ref: G10]. Prioritization moved from "what can we build?" to "what should we build?" [Ref: L2]. Product-led growth emergence (~2016) [Ref: A9] emphasized activation/retention metrics in prioritization.

**Current State (2018-2025)**: Shift toward outcome-based frameworks—North Star (Amplitude 2018) [Ref: G4], Opportunity Solution Trees (Torres 2021) [Ref: G9], RICE variations. Discovery-driven prioritization replaced roadmap-first [Ref: L4]. AI/ML capabilities enabling predictive impact scoring [Ref: A11].

**Trend Analysis**: Moving toward (1) real-time reprioritization using live data; (2) customer outcome proxies over feature delivery; (3) probabilistic frameworks acknowledging uncertainty; (4) AI-assisted prioritization [Ref: A12].

**Driving Forces**: Release frequency (yearly → daily), data availability (intuition → metrics), market velocity (first-mover → fast-follower), customer expectations (features → outcomes).

**Implications**: Future PMs need (1) historical framework knowledge to choose appropriate tools; (2) data literacy for quantitative prioritization; (3) outcome thinking over feature thinking; (4) comfort with continuous reprioritization.

**Artifact** (Timeline):

| Era       | Dominant Framework | Driver                    | Cycle Time | Decision Basis |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|
| 1990-2000 | MoSCoW/CBA        | Waterfall constraints     | 12-24mo    | Engineering cost |
| 2000-2010 | Kano/Value-Effort | Agile adoption            | 3-6mo      | Customer value |
| 2010-2018 | RICE/WSJF/ICE     | Data availability         | 2-4wk      | Quantified impact |
| 2018-2025 | North Star/OST    | PLG/Outcomes focus        | Continuous | Customer outcomes |
| 2025+     | AI-assisted/Real-time | Predictive analytics  | Real-time  | Predicted outcomes |

**Confidence**: High (well-documented evolution; strong citation support)
