### Step 3: Generate Q&A (5 at a time → self-check each batch)

**Question Design**:
- Format: "How did X evolve?", "Why was Y created?", "What trends led to Z?", "Where is W heading?"
- Include: Specific timeframes, evolution phases, inflection points, emerging patterns
- Test ≥2 temporal signals: origin context, evolution drivers, paradigm shifts, trend forecasting, pattern recognition
- Avoid: Current tactical decisions, hypothetical scenarios, "What would you do if..."

**Difficulty Alignment**:
- F (5yr): "How has PLG adoption changed since 2020?"
- I (10-15yr): "Trace waterfall → agile → continuous delivery evolution in PM"
- A (20+yr): "Why did PM emerge as distinct from engineering? How has the role fundamentally changed?"

**Answer Structure** (150–300 words):
1. Key Insight (1 sentence): Core temporal pattern/inflection point
2. Origin Context [Ref: G#/A#]: Why created, initial problem, creator/timeframe
3. Evolution Timeline: Key milestones, paradigm shifts, adoption curve, market forces
4. Current State: Present usage, maturity, mainstream adoption
5. Trend Analysis: Emerging patterns, future projections, successor approaches
6. Driving Forces: Technology, market dynamics, user behavior shifts
7. Implications: Impact on PM practice today/tomorrow
8. Citations: ≥1 [Ref: ID] (prioritize historical + trend)
9. Artifact (optional): Timeline, evolution diagram, adoption curve, trend projection

**Batch Self-Check**: Origin/history/trend-focused | ≥2 temporal signals | 150–300 words | Concrete insight | ≥2 temporal dimensions | ≥3/5 have ≥1 cite (≥1/5 has ≥2) | Difficulty matches timeframe

### Step 4: Create Visuals (≥1 diagram + ≥1 table per topic)

- **Stakeholder**: Management evolution, org structure shifts
- **GTM**: PLG adoption curve (2015-2025), GTM model evolution

### Step 5: Populate References
- **Glossary**: **G#. Term (Acronym)** | Definition | Origin year, creator | Evolution | Current use | Related | Limitations | Alphabetize
- **Tools**: **T#. Tool (Category)** | Description | Launch year | Adoption | Market evolution | Predecessor | URL | Group by category
- **Literature**: **L#. Author, Title, Year** | Historical context | Summary | Influence/legacy | Relevance | Group EN, then ZH
- **Citations**: **A#. [Citation] [Lang]** | Type (historical/trend/foundational) | Sort by ID
- **Check**: 100% [Ref: ID] resolve | No orphans | All fields complete | Temporal balance verified

2. **Signal**: Tests temporal understanding | ✓ "What drove feature → outcome roadmap shift?" | ✗ "List roadmap types"
3. **Depth**: Enables evolution analysis | ✓ "Trace AARRR origin to current—what changed/why?" | ✗ "Is AARRR relevant?"
4. **Realism**: Senior+ PM knowledge | ✓ "Compare PM roles 2000 vs 2010 vs 2020—paradigm shifts?" | ✗ "When was PM invented?"
5. **Discriminative**: Pattern recognition not recall | ✓ "What patterns suggest where PM tooling heads next?" | ✗ "When was Mixpanel founded?"
6. **Alignment**: Difficulty matches timeframe | F: 5yr trends | I: 10-15yr evolution | A: 20+yr origins/shifts

## V. Example

**Q1: Trace product prioritization framework evolution from 1990s to today. What drove major shifts and where is it heading?**

**Difficulty**: A | **Topic**: Prioritization & Roadmapping

**Key Insight**: Frameworks evolved engineering-centric (MoSCoW) → value-centric (RICE/WSJF) → outcome-centric (North Star/OST), driven by faster release cycles, data availability, market competition.

**Answer** (268 words):

**Origin Context** [Ref: A3]: Pre-2000s prioritization was engineering-driven (MoSCoW 1994, Clegg [Ref: G7], cost-benefit analysis)—reflecting waterfall constraints where changing priorities was expensive [Ref: L5].

**Early Evolution (2000-2010)**: Agile adoption created continuous prioritization need [Ref: A8]. RICE emerged at Intercom (~2016) [Ref: G2] codifying reach/impact/confidence/effort—shift toward quantification as SaaS enabled faster iteration/A/B testing [Ref: T1]. Kano model (1984, popularized 2000s) introduced customer satisfaction dimension [Ref: A2].

**Middle Period (2010-2018)**: Data explosion drove weighted scoring (WSJF from SAFe 2011 [Ref: G8], ICE ~2008 [Ref: G10]). Prioritization shifted "what can we build?" → "what should we build?" [Ref: L2]. PLG emergence (~2016) [Ref: A9] emphasized activation/retention metrics.

**Current State (2018-2025)**: Shift toward outcome-based frameworks—North Star (Amplitude 2018) [Ref: G4], Opportunity Solution Trees (Torres 2021) [Ref: G9], RICE variations. Discovery-driven prioritization replaced roadmap-first [Ref: L4]. AI/ML enabling predictive impact scoring [Ref: A11].

**Trend Analysis**: Moving toward (1) real-time reprioritization using live data; (2) customer outcome proxies over feature delivery; (3) probabilistic frameworks acknowledging uncertainty; (4) AI-assisted prioritization [Ref: A12].

**Driving Forces**: Release frequency (yearly → daily), data availability (intuition → metrics), market velocity (first-mover → fast-follower), customer expectations (features → outcomes).

**Implications**: Future PMs need (1) historical framework knowledge for tool selection; (2) data literacy for quantitative prioritization; (3) outcome over feature thinking; (4) comfort with continuous reprioritization.

**Artifact**:

| 2000-2010 | Kano/Value-Effort | Agile adoption    | 3-6mo      | Customer value |
| 2010-2018 | RICE/WSJF/ICE | Data availability     | 2-4wk      | Quantified impact |
