## Examples

### F (20%): Identify + Assess
**Q**: [Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery | Stakeholder: Business Analyst, PM] How assess if generative AI adoption presents a strategic opportunity for requirements elicitation automation?  
**A** (~220w): **Context**: Technology opportunity, requirements phase, BA/PM roles. **Analysis**: Generative AI (GPT-4, Claude) shows 35-40% productivity gains in documentation tasks [Ref: A1]. TAM for requirements tools: $4.2B (2024), 18% CAGR [Ref: A12]. **SWOT**: *Strengths*: Existing LLM subscriptions, technical team. *Weaknesses*: No prompt engineering expertise, unstructured legacy requirements. *Opportunities*: Automate user story generation, acceptance criteria drafting, domain modeling—saves 5-8h/week per BA [Ref: A2]. Early mover advantage. *Threats*: Hallucination risks (15-25% error rate) [Ref: A3], data privacy for sensitive domains, team resistance. **Reasoning**: Market validated (GitHub Copilot 55% faster [Ref: A1]), low-risk pilot (3-month, 2 BAs, non-critical projects). **Metrics**: Cycle time reduction ≥30%, quality (defect escape ≤5%). **When NOT**: Highly regulated (FDA, aviation) until governance mature; <5 BAs (ROI <12mo). **Insight**: Tests ability to balance productivity gains against quality/risk trade-offs—foundational for AI-First transformation.

### I (40%): Multi-Angle Analysis
**Q**: [Phase 2: Architecture & Design | Stakeholders: Architect, Security, SRE] API gateway market consolidating around 3 vendors. Evaluate opportunity to adopt managed service vs. self-hosted OSS, considering performance (p95 <100ms), cost ($50K/yr budget), and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR).  
**A** (~280w): **Context**: Technology + business opportunity, design phase, multi-stakeholder (Arch, Sec, SRE). **Analysis**: API gateway TAM $2.1B, 22% CAGR [Ref: A8]. Managed services (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway) growing 35% YoY vs OSS (Envoy, Traefik) 12% [Ref: A9]. **SWOT**: *Strengths*: Cloud-native infra, $50K budget, SRE team (5). *Weaknesses*: No Envoy expertise, compliance gaps (audit trail). *Opportunities*: (1) Managed: SLA 99.95%, compliance built-in, saves 15-20 SRE hours/month [Ref: A10]. (2) OSS: 40-60% lower TCO, customization, no vendor lock-in. *Threats*: Vendor pricing increases (20-30% annually [Ref: A11]), OSS maintenance burden (2-3 SRE FTEs), performance variance (p95 50-150ms for OSS vs. 30-80ms managed [Ref: A9]). **Porter's Five Forces**: High supplier power (3 vendors), low switching cost (API standard). **Reasoning**: Compliance critical (SOC 2 audit Q2)—managed reduces risk. Performance: AWS API Gateway p95 60ms @ $0.90/M requests [Ref: A10] fits budget + SLA. **Action Plan**: Q1: Managed pilot (AWS); Q2: Compliance audit; Q3: Re-evaluate OSS if budget increases. **Metrics**: p95 ≤90ms, cost ≤$50K, audit pass, MTTR ≤30min. **When NOT**: If cost >$100K (OSS wins) or need custom protocols (gRPC-Web). **Insight**: Tests multi-criteria optimization (performance, cost, compliance, risk)—balancing technical and business constraints.

### A (40%): Strategic Synthesis + Validation Roadmap
**Q**: [Phase 8: Evolution & Governance | Stakeholders: Leadership, Architect, PM, DevOps] Platform team observes: (1) Microservices sprawl (250+ services, 15 teams), (2) AI coding tools (Copilot) increasing velocity 40% but tech debt +25% [Ref: A1, A15], (3) New EU AI Act requiring explainability by 2026 [Ref: A16]. Three proposals: (A) Platform engineering (backstage, golden paths), (B) Consolidate to domain-driven services (50-80 services), (C) AI governance framework. Budget: $2M, 12 months. Recommend strategy.  
**A** (~390w): **Context**: Cross-domain opportunity (Technology + Regulatory + Organizational), evolution phase, multi-stakeholder strategic decision. **Multi-Framework Analysis**: (1) **Blue Ocean**: Platform engineering creates uncontested space—eliminates cognitive load (73% dev time on toil [Ref: A13]) via self-service. (2) **Disruptive Innovation**: AI coding without governance risks "technical bankruptcy"—fast but fragile [Ref: A15]. (3) **Porter's Five Forces**: Internal rivalry (team autonomy vs. standards)—consolidation reduces complexity but limits agility. **SWOT**: *Strengths*: $2M budget, 15 teams, AI adoption momentum. *Weaknesses*: No platform eng expertise, sprawl legacy (250 services), compliance gaps. *Opportunities*: (A) Platform: 30-40% velocity gain, 50% onboarding time reduction [Ref: A14], Golden paths enforce AI governance. (B) Consolidation: -60% services, -40% operational cost [Ref: L6], but 18-24mo migration. (C) AI governance: EU compliance, explainability, but no velocity/cost benefit. *Threats*: EU fines (€35M or 7% revenue [Ref: A16]), AI technical debt compounds (code quality -15% annually [Ref: A15]), talent attrition (toil burnout). **Risk Matrix**: (A) Medium prob/High impact = HIGH PRIORITY; (B) Low prob/High impact = DEFER; (C) High prob/Medium impact = MEDIUM PRIORITY. **Strategic Reasoning**: Platform + AI governance (hybrid A+C) captures 3 opportunities: (1) Velocity via golden paths, (2) Compliance via governance gates, (3) Quality via automated checks. **Phased Plan**: Q1-Q2: Platform pilot (3 teams, Backstage [Ref: T5], AI governance templates); Q3: Expand to 8 teams, measure velocity/quality/compliance; Q4-Q3: Full rollout, consolidation roadmap (domain-driven design [Ref: L5]). **Metrics**: Velocity +25%, tech debt neutral, compliance 100%, ROI 18mo. **When NOT**: <10 teams (over-engineering), <6mo to EU deadline (compliance-only), high team turnover (platform adoption fails). **Validation Gates**: (1) Q2: Pilot velocity +20%, quality stable—GO. (2) Q3: 8-team adoption ≥80%—GO to full rollout. (3) Any: Compliance gap—STOP, prioritize governance. **Insight**: Tests ability to synthesize conflicting signals (velocity vs. quality vs. compliance), balance innovation and risk, design multi-phase validation—executive-level strategic thinking.

## Complete Example (Advanced)

**Q**: [Phase 6: Operations & Observability | Stakeholders: SRE, Security, Leadership, Data Engineer] Observability market growing 28% CAGR ($5.2B 2024 → $18B 2029) [Ref: A5]. Your platform (15 microservices, 50K rps) has: (1) Costs: Datadog $120K/yr, 40% growth YoY; (2) Vendor lock-in: proprietary query language, no data portability; (3) New AI-powered observability tools (Datadog AI, New Relic AI) claim 60% MTTR reduction [Ref: A6]. Leadership asks: "Evaluate opportunity to adopt OpenTelemetry + open-source stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, Loki) vs. upgrading to AI-powered commercial tools. Budget: $150K/yr. Decide within 3 months."

**Difficulty**: A | **Phase**: 6 (Operations & Observability) | **Stakeholders**: SRE, Security, Leadership, Data Engineer | **Domain**: Technology & Innovation + Business & Market  
**Key Insight**: Tests ability to synthesize technology trends (OpenTelemetry, AI), business constraints (cost, vendor lock-in), operational risk (MTTR, data portability), and stakeholder priorities—distinguishes strategic from tactical thinking in cost-vs-capability trade-offs.

**Answer** (395w):  
**Context**: Technology + business opportunity, operations phase, multi-stakeholder strategic decision balancing cost, capability, risk, and vendor dependency.

**Opportunity Analysis**: Observability TAM $5.2B (2024), 28% CAGR [Ref: A5]. Three trends: (1) OpenTelemetry adoption 180% YoY (CNCF survey, 2024) [Ref: A7]—vendor-neutral standard reduces lock-in. (2) AI-powered observability (Datadog AI, New Relic AI): 60% MTTR reduction, 40% alert noise reduction [Ref: A6]. (3) OSS maturity: Prometheus (90K stars), Grafana (65K stars), Tempo (3K stars), Loki (20K stars)—proven at scale (Netflix, Uber). **Market evidence**: 45% enterprises migrating to OSS observability (Gartner, 2024) [Ref: A8] for cost (-50-70%) + portability.

**SWOT Analysis**:  
- **Strengths**: SRE team (5), cloud-native (K8s), existing Prometheus metrics (15 services), data engineering capacity (3). Budget flexibility ($150K). [Ref: Internal]  
- **Weaknesses**: No OpenTelemetry expertise (0 implementations), Datadog query language lock-in (200+ dashboards, 50+ alerts), migration risk (service disruption, metric gaps), AI/ML capability gaps (no model training). [Ref: Internal]  
- **Opportunities**: (1) **OSS Path**: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana/Tempo/Loki—saves $70-90K/yr (TCO $30-50K) [Ref: A9], data portability (vendor-neutral), customization (anomaly detection via open-source ML). (2) **AI Path**: Datadog AI—60% MTTR (30min → 12min) [Ref: A6], 40% alert noise reduction (1000 → 600 alerts/week), no migration risk. (3) **Hybrid**: OpenTelemetry + OSS + AI layer (selectively adopt AI for anomaly detection). [Ref: F1, F4]  
- **Threats**: (1) OSS migration: 6-9mo effort (2-3 SRE FTEs), metric gaps (15-25% initial coverage loss), alert fatigue during transition. (2) AI vendor: pricing increases (30-40% annually [Ref: A10]), lock-in deepens (proprietary AI models). (3) Hybrid: complexity (2 stacks), team skills gap (OpenTelemetry + ML). [Ref: A9, L6]

**Multi-Framework Analysis**:  
- **Blue Ocean Strategy** [Ref: F2, L2]: Hybrid creates uncontested space—OSS cost + AI capability—eliminates trade-off.  
- **Porter's Five Forces** [Ref: F3, L4]: High supplier power (Datadog oligopoly), high switching cost (dashboard/alert migration), but OpenTelemetry reduces lock-in (standardization).  
- **Risk Matrix** [Ref: F8]: (1) OSS migration: Medium probability (60%), High impact (service disruption)—MEDIUM-HIGH RISK. (2) AI vendor lock-in: High probability (80%), Medium impact (cost increase)—MEDIUM-HIGH RISK. (3) Hybrid complexity: Low probability (30%), Low impact (team overhead)—LOW RISK.

**Strategic Reasoning**: **Why now**: OpenTelemetry maturity (v1.0 stable, 2023) [Ref: A7], cost pressure ($120K → $150K unsustainable). **Why us**: Cloud-native stack (K8s), SRE/data eng capacity, Prometheus baseline. **Differentiation**: Hybrid approach (OSS + selectively AI)—captures cost savings + AI benefits without full lock-in. **Validation**: 3-month pilot (3 services, OSS stack, AI for critical services only) [Ref: L5].

**Action Plan** (Phased, 12 months):  
- **Q1 (3mo)**: Pilot hybrid—(1) OpenTelemetry SDK on 3 services (non-critical); (2) Deploy Prometheus/Grafana/Tempo (self-hosted, 20% traffic); (3) Datadog AI on 2 critical services (payments, auth). Measure: cost, MTTR, coverage, alert accuracy. Go/No-go: Cost < $40K, MTTR ≤20min, coverage ≥80%.  
- **Q2-Q3 (6mo)**: If PASS—expand to 10 services, train SRE (OpenTelemetry), migrate dashboards/alerts (80%), deploy OSS anomaly detection (open-source ML: Prophet, IsolationForest). Stakeholder alignment: monthly reviews (SRE, Security, Leadership).  
- **Q4 (3mo)**: Full migration (15 services), decommission Datadog (retain AI for 2 critical services), measure 12-month TCO.

**Success Metrics**: (1) **Cost**: TCO ≤$60K/yr (OSS $40K + Datadog AI $20K for 2 services = 50% savings). (2) **Performance**: MTTR ≤20min (AI on critical), p95 query latency <500ms (OSS). (3) **Risk**: Zero service disruptions, metric coverage ≥95%, alert accuracy ≥90%. (4) **Validation Gates**: Q1 pilot PASS (cost/MTTR/coverage), Q2 80% migration, Q3 AI anomaly detection deployed.

**Constraints & "When NOT"**:  
- **Budget**: If budget >$200K, full AI vendor justified (ROI <12mo).  
- **Skills**: If SRE <3, migration fails (6-9mo effort).  
- **Regulatory**: If SOC 2/HIPAA, OSS requires audit (add $20-30K). [Ref: A11]  
- **Time**: If <6mo to launch, migration risk too high—defer to post-launch.  
- **Scenarios to Avoid**: (1) 100% OSS if MTTR critical (<15min SLA)—AI essential. (2) 100% AI vendor if cost >$150K unsustainable. (3) No OpenTelemetry—lock-in deepens.

Validation Roadmap (3-Month Pilot)

Month 1: Deploy OpenTelemetry + OSS (3 services) + Datadog AI (2 critical)
  • Metrics: Cost <$40K, coverage ≥80%, MTTR baseline
  • Gate: If cost >$40K or coverage <80% → STOP, reassess

Month 2: Expand to 6 services, migrate 40% dashboards/alerts
  • Metrics: MTTR ≤20min (AI), query latency <500ms (OSS)
  • Gate: If MTTR >25min or latency >800ms → PAUSE, tune

Month 3: Evaluate 3-month TCO, MTTR, alert accuracy, SRE feedback
  • Decision: If TCO <$60K + MTTR ≤20min + coverage ≥95% → GO (Q2-Q3 full migration)
  • Failure: If any metric fails → PIVOT (consider full AI or defer OSS)
