# Extract Connectors & Discourse Markers for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract connectors, discourse markers, transition words, and linking expressions that are essential for coherent communication from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one connector or discourse marker with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, synonyms, function, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all connectors and discourse markers that establish relationships between ideas
- Prioritize: logical connectors, discourse markers, transition phrases, and cohesive devices
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on high-impact connectors for fluency)
- Do not skip sections; cover both explicit and subtle linking expressions

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in connectors actually present in source
- Never invent connectors not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Logical connectors (cause/effect, contrast, addition, sequence)
- Discourse markers (organize discourse, signal shifts)
- Transition phrases (between topics, ideas, paragraphs)
- Cohesive devices (reference, substitution, ellipsis markers)
- Hedging and boosting expressions
- Conversational connectors (turn-taking, emphasis)

**Format:**
- **Connector**: [expression] (function: addition/contrast/cause/sequence/emphasis/etc.)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain discourse function clearly*
  - *Use simple language to describe logical relationship*
  - *Include register information (formal/informal/neutral)*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative connectors with same function
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 connectors with opposite logical function (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or registers where this connector is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this connector would be inappropriate or create logical errors
- **Common Patterns**: Typical sentence positions and punctuation patterns
- **Root Analysis**: Break down components (if applicable for compound connectors)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Connector**: [expression] (function: addition/contrast/cause/sequence/etc.)
   **Meaning**: 
   - [Collins-style definition]
   - *Function*: [describe logical/discourse relationship created]
   
   **Synonyms**: [connector1], [connector2], [connector3]...
   
   **Antonyms**: [opposite-function connector1], [connector2]... (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: [Context description - formality, text type, specific logical relationships]
   
   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - wrong register, incorrect logical relationship, overuse patterns]
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Position]: sentence-initial / mid-sentence / sentence-final
   - [Punctuation]: comma usage, semicolon patterns
   - [Typical structure]: [connector] + [clause pattern]
   
   **Root Analysis**: [components] + [meanings] (if applicable)
   
   **Etymology**: [Origin language] → [historical development] (brief)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Natural conversational example 1]
   - [Natural conversational example 2]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - [Academic/professional example 1]
   - [Academic/professional example 2]

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on connectors that are essential for coherent, fluent communication
- Prioritize connectors with learning value (formal/academic writing, subtle distinctions in meaning)
- Clearly indicate register restrictions and typical positions in sentences
