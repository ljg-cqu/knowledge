# Extract Conjunctions for Vocabulary Learning

**Task**: Extract conjunctions (coordinating, subordinating, correlative) that are essential for constructing complex sentences and expressing logical relationships from the source text.

**Definition**: Each entry focuses on one conjunction with comprehensive learning information including meaning, usage context, function, grammatical patterns, and examples across registers.

**Rules**:

**Coverage:**
- Read entire source thoroughly—identify all conjunctions that connect clauses, phrases, or words
- Prioritize: subordinating conjunctions (complex sentences), coordinating conjunctions (compound structures), correlative pairs
- Extract comprehensively to reflect source richness; apply 80/20 principle (focus on conjunctions essential for sentence complexity)
- Do not skip sections; cover both common and specialized conjunctions

**Fidelity:**
- Ground all information in conjunctions actually present in source
- Never invent conjunctions not in source
- Derive meaning from context when source provides it; supplement with standard dictionary definitions

**Focus:**
- Coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
- Subordinating conjunctions (because, although, if, when, while, since, etc.)
- Correlative conjunctions (either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also)
- Conjunctive adverbs functioning as conjunctions (however, moreover, nevertheless)
- Conditional and concessive conjunctions

**Format:**
- **Conjunction**: [word/phrase] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative)
- **Meaning**: Collins Dictionary style definition(s)
  - *Explain grammatical function clearly*
  - *Describe logical relationship created*
  - *Include clause patterns (independent + independent, independent + dependent)*
- **Synonyms**: 3-5 alternative conjunctions with same function
- **Antonyms**: 2-4 conjunctions expressing opposite logical relationship (if applicable)
- **When to Use**: Context, situations, or registers where this conjunction is appropriate
- **When NOT to Use**: Contexts where this conjunction would be inappropriate or create grammatical errors
- **Common Patterns**: Grammatical structures and punctuation rules
- **Root Analysis**: Break down word components (for compound conjunctions)
- **Etymology**: Language origin and historical development (brief)
- **Examples [Casual]**: 2 natural example sentences in informal register
- **Examples [Formal]**: 2 natural example sentences in formal/academic register

**Output Format**:

Markdown ordered list only:
1. **Conjunction**: [word/phrase] (type: coordinating/subordinating/correlative)
   **Meaning**: 
   - [Collins-style definition]
   - *Function*: [grammatical function and logical relationship]
   
   **Synonyms**: [conjunction1], [conjunction2], [conjunction3]...
   
   **Antonyms**: [opposite-relationship conjunction1], [conjunction2]... (if applicable)
   
   **When to Use**: [Context description - sentence complexity, logical relationships, register]
   
   **When NOT to Use**: [Inappropriate contexts - grammatical errors, wrong logical relationship, sentence fragments]
   
   **Common Patterns**: 
   - [Clause structure]: [independent clause] + [conjunction] + [independent/dependent clause]
   - [Punctuation]: comma rules, semicolon patterns
   - [Common errors to avoid]: fragment risks, comma splices
   
   **Root Analysis**: [components] + [meanings] (if applicable)
   
   **Etymology**: [Origin language] → [historical development] (brief)
   
   **Examples [Casual]**: 
   - [Natural conversational example 1]
   - [Natural conversational example 2]
   
   **Examples [Formal]**: 
   - [Academic/professional example 1]
   - [Academic/professional example 2]

**Instructions**:
- Use `1.` for every item; Markdown auto-numbers
- Output list only—no headings, comments, or explanations
- Focus on conjunctions that are essential for complex sentence construction
- Prioritize conjunctions with learning value (subordinating conjunctions for academic writing, correlative pairs)
- Clearly indicate grammatical patterns and punctuation rules
