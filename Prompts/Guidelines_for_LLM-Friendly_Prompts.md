# Guidelines for LLM-Friendly Prompts

Craft concise, precise prompts for better LLM responses.

## Guidelines

1. Be concise: eliminate repetition and trim unnecessary language; preserve essential information.
2. Provide full context: state constraints, assumptions, and scope.
3. Use precise wording: avoid ambiguity and maintain consistent terminology.
4. Structure for clarity: use lists, tables, diagrams, formulas, or code blocks.
5. Reference sources: cite verified sources; flag any uncertainty.
6. Prompt quality: request reasoning, self-review, and validation checks.
7. Define success: specify measurable, concrete criteria.
8. Apply MECE: ensure coverage is complete and non-overlapping; avoid redundant or extraneous details.
