# Guidelines for LLM-Friendly Prompts

Craft concise, precise prompts for better LLM responses.

## Guidelines

- Concision & MECE: remove repetition; keep only essentials; ensure complete, non-overlapping coverage.
- Context: state scope, constraints, and assumptions.
- Wording: be precise; avoid ambiguity; use consistent terminology.
- Structure & output: use lists/tables/diagrams/formulas/code blocks; request structured, navigable output with a TOC linking to headings, sections, and lists.
- Evidence: cite verified sources and flag uncertainty.
- Quality: ask for reasoning, self-review, and validation checks.
- Success: define measurable, concrete criteria.
