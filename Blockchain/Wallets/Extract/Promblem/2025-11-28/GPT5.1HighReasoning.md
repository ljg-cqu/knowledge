1. Q: In the context of self-custodial blockchain wallets, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Catastrophic, irrecoverable loss of digital assets caused by end-user mismanagement of private keys and seed phrases in non-custodial wallets, despite years of UX and education efforts.
   - **Background and current situation**: Self-custody wallets place full key responsibility on users; industry estimates suggest roughly 20% of all Bitcoin supply has been lost to key loss, while surveys report about a quarter of holders have forgotten or misplaced keys and over 20% have sent funds to wrong addresses. Current designs rely primarily on mnemonic backups and manual checks, so a single mistake can permanently destroy wealth.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Reduce the rate of catastrophic wallet loss events (irrecoverable asset loss due to key or address errors) by at least 50% over 12–24 months for active users, and increase the share of users with a verified, safe backup from today’s roughly 50–60% range to at least 90%. Target measurable reductions in key-loss–related support tickets and on-chain misdirected payments (for example, mis-sent transactions falling below 1–2% of total sends).
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Must preserve non-custodial ownership semantics (no centralized key escrow), operate on resource-constrained mobile devices, and respect irreversible blockchain semantics (no global rollback). Security teams, product teams, and support staff operate under limited headcount and budget, and must comply with jurisdictional regulations around key recovery and liability.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Retail users and prosumers whose savings are at risk; wallet product teams who own UX and flows; security engineers responsible for cryptographic design and threat models; customer support teams handling loss incidents; regulators and consumer-protection bodies concerned with systemic retail harm.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Time horizon of 1–3 years, with critical milestones in the first 6–12 months as user bases grow. The problem affects tens of millions of existing users and future cohorts across major chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, EVM sidechains, and Layer 2 networks) and can represent 10–20% or more of total value at risk for non-custodial platforms.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Seed phrases, paper backups, and hardware wallets reduce some risks but remain error-prone or inaccessible to mainstream users; social recovery and guardian-based schemes have limited adoption due to trust and complexity concerns; some wallets experiment with MPC and account abstraction, but these introduce protocol complexity and uneven chain support. No approach has yet produced consistently low loss rates at consumer scale.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Large fractions of certain asset supplies are believed lost; surveys confirm high rates of key loss and mis-sent funds; blockchains provide no native undo path. Assumptions: Similar loss patterns will persist or worsen as less technical users enter unless wallet architecture changes. Uncertainties: The true distribution of loss across user segments, the long-term adoption of MPC or account-abstraction-based wallets, and the extent to which insurers or third parties may share loss burdens.

1. Q: In the context of blockchain wallet recovery design, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Structural failure to provide recovery mechanisms that simultaneously satisfy user expectations for security, usability, and availability, leading to either unusable flows or unsafe shortcuts.
   - **Background and current situation**: User studies of hundreds of crypto holders show no single recovery method rates highly across all three dimensions; simple approaches like paper backups are perceived as usable and available but weak on security, while more secure schemes such as key splitting, hardware modules, or guardian models score poorly on usability and real-world availability. Many users strongly distrust storing key material with friends, family, or third-party guardians, creating a gap between developer-proposed “social recovery” models and actual user preferences.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Design recovery options that at least 70–80% of target users rate as acceptable on security, usability, and availability, while keeping the probability of permanent loss after a device or account compromise below 1–2% per year. Aim for a recovery process that achieves at least a 95% successful recovery rate in real incidents, with median recovery time measured in hours rather than days.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Cannot rely on centralized custodians holding full keys; must respect regulatory limits on data retention and identity binding; needs to function across heterogeneous devices and jurisdictions; and must keep implementation complexity and audit cost within realistic bounds. Recovery designs must coexist with existing seed-phrase and hardware users during long migration periods.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Everyday users facing device loss or theft; power users and institutions with stricter threat models; wallet designers and UX researchers; protocol and smart-contract teams implementing recovery logic; auditors and red-teamers validating schemes; and regulators watching for de-facto custodial behavior.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: One- to three-year horizon as new wallet generations roll out and account abstraction standards mature; impacts virtually all self-custodial users and any ecosystem that relies on them (including DeFi, NFT markets, and on-chain gaming). Failure to solve the issue constrains mainstream adoption and keeps a significant share of potential users on custodial exchanges.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Traditional seed backups and “write this phrase on paper” flows; hardware wallets; multi-signature wallets; social recovery guardians; and MPC-based shard storage have all been deployed with partial success. However, survey data shows fragmentation in user trust and satisfaction, and many solutions remain niche or fragile under real-world behavior.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: No dominant, widely trusted recovery model exists; user trust in friends and family guardianship is low; paper and digital backups are routinely mishandled. Assumptions: Users will accept modest extra friction if it clearly improves recoverability and is well explained. Uncertainties: How different cultures and regulatory environments influence acceptable guardianship models, and how much complexity mainstream users can realistically handle.

1. Q: In the context of user trust and adoption of self-custody wallets, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Pervasive user anxiety about making irreversible security mistakes in self-custody wallets, which suppresses investment levels and slows mainstream adoption even when no incident has yet occurred.
   - **Background and current situation**: Surveys show nearly half of crypto holders fear losing assets through their own errors more than through external hacking, and around half report not investing as much as they otherwise would because of wallet-related security concerns. Even when users enable protections like multi-factor authentication or unique passwords, many continue risky behaviors such as password reuse or storing seed phrases digitally, reflecting cognitive overload and misunderstood threat models.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Increase self-reported confidence scores in wallet safety by at least 20–30 percentage points in target segments while measurably raising average holdings or transaction volumes without increasing realized loss rates. Aim to reduce the proportion of users who cite “fear of self-custody mistakes” as a top-three barrier to further adoption to below 10–15%.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Wallet teams cannot change fundamental blockchain properties like transaction irreversibility; marketing claims must remain honest; and UX simplifications must not mask real risks or encourage reckless behavior. Education budgets, research bandwidth, and UI real estate are limited.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Retail users and prospective entrants; exchanges and on-ramps deciding whether to promote self-custody; wallet providers whose growth depends on user trust; regulators and consumer advocates concerned with mis-selling of “safe” self-custody; and ecosystem projects depending on a healthy non-custodial user base.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: One- to five-year window as the next wave of users arrives; impacts the total addressable market for non-custodial wallets, DeFi, and on-chain applications. At scale, a 5–10% change in adoption or average balance can translate to billions of dollars in assets under management.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Education campaigns, in-app warnings, security scorecards, and “simple mode” user interfaces have reduced some obvious pitfalls but have not eliminated fear. Some providers market “seedless” or MPC-based wallets as safer, yet incidents and media stories about lost funds or hacks continue to dominate user perception.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Surveys explicitly link fear of self-inflicted mistakes to reduced investment; human error remains the leading cause of loss. Assumptions: Clearer mental models and visible protections can shift behavior and risk perception. Uncertainties: How much reassurance comes from UX and education versus third-party guarantees such as insurance, and how perceptions vary by region and demographic.

1. Q: In the context of wallet-connected protocols and infrastructure, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: End-to-end asset safety for wallet users is undermined by vulnerabilities in smart contracts, consensus protocols, and supporting infrastructure that lie outside the wallet’s direct control but are invisible to most users.
   - **Background and current situation**: Historic incidents such as major decentralized autonomous organization hacks and multi-signature wallet bugs, reentrancy and overflow vulnerabilities, transaction malleability, 51% attacks on smaller chains, Sybil and eclipse attacks, and infrastructure-level denial-of-service or misconfiguration have together caused billions in losses. Wallets act as the primary user interface to these brittle systems, yet users typically blame the wallet brand when underlying protocols fail.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Reduce user exposure to protocol-level and infrastructure-level failures by orders of magnitude (for example, more than 90% reduction in incidents affecting wallet users over two to three years) through improved risk gating, monitoring, and integration choices. Clarify accountability so that users understand which risks are inherent to underlying networks versus wallet software.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Wallet teams cannot unilaterally fix chain protocols or third-party smart contracts; on-chain immutability limits post-hoc patching; and avoiding all risky ecosystems may conflict with user demand and business objectives. Instrumentation and risk-screening add latency, complexity, and operational cost.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Wallet product and security teams; decentralized application and DeFi protocol developers whose contracts users interact with; node operators and infrastructure providers; end users whose assets are at risk; insurers and institutional clients evaluating systemic risk; and regulators investigating large-scale failures.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Multi-year (two to five years) as protocols evolve and audits mature, with acute impact during high-volatility or high-total-value-locked periods. The problem spans all major public chains and affects both retail and institutional flows, with single incidents capable of wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Code audits, bug bounties, formal verification tools, upgradeable proxy contracts, and best-practice hardening have reduced some classes of bugs but not eliminated catastrophic failures. Some wallets add warnings or whitelists for certain contracts or chains, but coverage is uneven and often lags behind emerging threats.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Repeated high-profile hacks on decentralized applications, bridges, and infrastructure continue despite audits; users rarely distinguish between “wallet failure” and protocol failure. Assumptions: Better integration standards and runtime checks at the wallet layer can significantly reduce exposure without blocking legitimate use. Uncertainties: How far wallet providers can or should go in censoring or scoring external protocols, and how quickly new classes of vulnerabilities will emerge.

1. Q: In the context of cross-chain interoperability for multi-chain wallets, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Systemic fragility and user-facing complexity created by wallets’ dependence on insecure cross-chain bridges and heterogeneous chains to offer a “single interface” across multiple networks.
   - **Background and current situation**: Cross-chain bridges have suffered some of the largest hacks in crypto history, with multiple incidents each exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars, while newer Layer 2 networks and sidechains fragment liquidity and require separate infrastructure. Users are forced to juggle multiple networks, wrapped tokens, and bridges, increasing the chance of mis-sending assets or getting stuck in compromised contracts.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Enable multi-chain asset management where the probability of a user losing funds due to a bridge or interoperability failure is driven down by more than 90% over two to three years, and where everyday users can understand which network they are on and what risks they are taking. Reduce failed or stuck cross-chain transfers to well under 1% of attempts.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Interoperability protocols and standards are still evolving and often incompatible; many projects lack the resources to build bespoke, fully audited bridges; and wallets face pressure to support new chains quickly for competitive reasons. Regulatory and compliance requirements around cross-chain flows and sanctions screening add further constraints.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Wallet developers responsible for chain integrations; bridge and interoperability protocol teams; exchanges and custodians offering cross-chain services; DeFi protocols relying on wrapped assets; and end users whose funds are exposed during cross-chain moves.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: One- to four-year horizon as interoperability standards mature; affects all users holding assets across multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, including institutions with complex treasury setups. Single bridge failures can instantly impact hundreds of thousands of users and billions in locked value.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Lock-and-mint bridges, notary schemes, relays, atomic swaps, and centralized exchange “synthetic” transfers have all been deployed, each with distinct trade-offs in decentralization, user experience, and security. Despite many redesigns and audits, bridge exploits remain frequent and high-impact.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: A large share of major DeFi hacks in recent years involve bridges or cross-chain infrastructure; liquidity is fragmented across chains and rollups. Assumptions: Some standardized interoperability layer will eventually emerge as a de facto norm. Uncertainties: Which standards will win, how secure they will prove under real-world stress, and how quickly existing wallets can migrate without breaking users.

1. Q: In the context of institutional adoption of blockchain wallets and custody, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Deep institutional trust deficit caused by past centralized exchange and custodian failures combined with regulatory ambiguity, making it hard to design wallet and custody models that satisfy both decentralization ideals and “bank-grade” regulatory expectations.
   - **Background and current situation**: Historic collapses and hacks at major exchanges and custodians have destroyed confidence in centralized pools of customer assets, while self-custody and decentralized finance architectures conflict with rules that require client assets to be held by qualified custodians. Regulatory regimes diverge across jurisdictions, with inconsistent classifications of digital assets and rapidly evolving guidance.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Enable institutional-scale use of wallets and custody arrangements that meet 100% of applicable regulatory requirements in priority jurisdictions, while avoiding single-point organizational failure and preserving on-chain composability. Target growth in institutional assets under management without a proportional increase in custody-related enforcement actions or loss events.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Legal definitions of custody, segregation, and control can differ sharply by regulator; some decentralized finance primitives may be fundamentally incompatible with existing rules; and building bank-grade operations (segregation, capital buffers, insurance, audits) is expensive. Institutions are risk-averse and move slowly.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Institutional investors, asset managers, and corporate treasuries; custodial banks and crypto-native custody providers; decentralized finance protocols seeking institutional liquidity; regulators and standard-setting bodies; and end clients whose capital is ultimately at risk.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Two- to five-year horizon as legal frameworks consolidate; impacts hundreds of billions in potential institutional capital that could flow on-chain. Design choices made now can lock in architectures that are hard to change later.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Centralized exchanges doubling as de facto custodians; specialized crypto custodians; bank-chartered digital asset custodians; and institutional self-custody products with policy-based controls have all emerged, yet high-profile failures and enforcement actions continue. Regulatory initiatives in multiple regions are still in flux.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Past failures have caused multibillion-dollar client asset losses; regulators have begun enforcing custody rules in the crypto context. Assumptions: Institutions will only commit sizably once they can map wallet and custody setups cleanly into existing risk and compliance frameworks. Uncertainties: The eventual shape of global standards and how much flexibility they will allow for novel wallet architectures.

1. Q: In the context of human-factor security for blockchain wallets, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Escalating human-factor risk, where user errors, social engineering, insider threats, and even physical coercion remain the dominant causes of loss despite technical security improvements in wallet software and protocols.
   - **Background and current situation**: Studies consistently show that preventable user mistakes (mis-sent funds, unsafe backups, reused passwords) outnumber sophisticated protocol exploits as causes of loss. At the same time, attackers increasingly use large-scale phishing, voice-based social engineering, deepfakes, and insider bribery, while high-net-worth holders face growing threats of physical coercion and so-called “wrench attacks.” Nation-state actors treat crypto theft as a revenue stream, bringing significant resources to bear.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Cut human-error-driven loss events by at least 50% and materially reduce successful social-engineering incidents over one to three years while preserving acceptable usability. Improve detection and response so that a high percentage of attempted human-factor attacks are discovered and blocked before funds move.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Wallet teams have limited control over users’ devices, environments, and personal security practices; stronger controls can increase friction and prompt fatigue; and privacy constraints may limit behavioral monitoring. Law-enforcement response times are often slow relative to the speed of on-chain transfers.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: End users across all wealth levels; wallet providers and exchanges; employees with privileged access at service providers; law-enforcement and intelligence agencies; insurers underwriting crypto risk; and advocacy groups concerned about surveillance and user autonomy.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Ongoing, with near-term focus on the next 12–36 months as attack sophistication grows. Affects the entire crypto ecosystem, with particular concentration of risk among high-value accounts, institutional operators, and employees with sensitive access.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Security awareness campaigns, stronger multi-factor authentication, transaction confirmations, withdrawal whitelists, and hardware wallets have reduced some classes of attacks but not eliminated phishing, social engineering, and coerced access. Newer approaches like behavioral biometrics and transaction-risk scoring are emerging but not yet ubiquitous.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Human error and social engineering account for a large share of losses; well-resourced threat actors target both users and infrastructure staff. Assumptions: Better defaults, safer UX patterns, and layered controls can meaningfully change outcomes without destroying usability. Uncertainties: How attackers will adapt to new defenses, and what level of behavioral monitoring users and regulators will tolerate.

1. Q: In the context of advanced key management architectures such as MPC and threshold signatures for wallets, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: High implementation and operational risk in adopting MPC- and threshold-signature-based wallets, where protocol choice, library quality, and runtime operations can introduce new single points of failure or latent vulnerabilities.
   - **Background and current situation**: Modern multi-party computation and threshold protocols promise to eliminate single private-key holders by distributing key shares across devices, servers, or institutions. However, early generations of threshold ECDSA schemes have suffered serious cryptographic attacks, and real-world deployments depend on complex distributed infrastructure, trusted execution environments, and network coordination. Many teams lack deep cryptography expertise yet feel competitive pressure to market “MPC wallets.”
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Enable safe adoption of MPC and threshold architectures such that they materially reduce key-compromise risk compared with well-designed single-key or multi-signature wallets, without introducing comparable new risks. Target zero major loss events attributable to protocol-level flaws or gross implementation mistakes in production MPC wallets over multi-year horizons.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Protocols must meet modern security standards (for example, malicious or universally composable security with audited libraries), but engineering teams and budgets are limited. Infrastructure must achieve high availability across regions while preserving strict isolation of key shares. Backward compatibility with existing chains and signing algorithms is required, and regulatory expectations for operational resilience and auditability must be met.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Custodians and institutions deploying MPC wallets; wallet vendors integrating third-party MPC providers; protocol designers and academic cryptographers; cloud and hardware vendors providing trusted execution environments and hardware security modules; regulators and auditors assessing systemic risk.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Two- to five-year period during which MPC wallets move from niche to mainstream institutional and possibly consumer use. Failures at this layer can instantly compromise or freeze large treasuries and damage trust in the entire technology stack.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Multiple generations of threshold protocols and diverse open-source and proprietary libraries have been deployed, with some later found vulnerable or misconfigured. Industry has begun to standardize and audit, but legacy systems and uneven upgrades persist.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Real cryptanalytic attacks have broken or weakened earlier threshold ECDSA constructions; high-profile providers rely on complex MPC stacks and trusted execution environments. Assumptions: With careful selection and operation, MPC wallets can offer a strictly better security–usability frontier. Uncertainties: How quickly the ecosystem will migrate away from legacy protocols, how many hidden implementation bugs remain, and how regulators will evaluate and mandate controls for such systems.
