## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: Single-signature wallet users lose funds to phishing attacks and social engineering scams that trick them into revealing seed phrases, signing malicious transactions, or granting excessive smart contract approvals. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     Phishing and social engineering remain highly effective attack vectors against single-sig wallet users, exploiting human psychology rather than cryptographic weaknesses. Attackers use fake websites (spoofed domain names), impersonation (customer support, influencers, project teams), malicious transaction signatures (drainer contracts), and excessive token approvals to steal assets. These attacks contributed to the $2.2 billion in crypto theft during 2024, with phishing/social engineering representing an estimated 30-40% of wallet compromise incidents [Web: CoinCover, 2024; The Block, 2024].
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Common attack patterns: (1) Fake wallet/DeFi websites using typosquatting (unisvvap.com vs uniswap.com) or homograph attacks (using Cyrillic characters that look like Latin); (2) Discord/Telegram impersonators posing as support staff requesting seed phrases; (3) Airdrop scams requiring wallet connection to malicious sites; (4) Malicious browser extensions harvesting credentials; (5) "Drainer" smart contracts that users unknowingly approve, granting unlimited token access [Web: Group-IB, 2024]. Single-sig wallets provide no transaction review period or approval oversight - once users sign, transactions execute immediately and irreversibly [Assumption]. Current browser wallet UIs poorly communicate transaction risks, showing cryptic hex data instead of human-readable impact ("This contract will access all your USDC") [Assumption]. User security awareness remains low: studies show 60-70% of users don't understand seed phrase implications or contract approval risks [Assumption: extrapolated from general cybersecurity literacy studies].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Phishing/social engineering loss rate: est. 30-40% of wallet compromises → <15% (min) / <10% (target) / <5% (ideal) by Q4 2025; Financial losses: est. $600-800M/yr → <$250M/yr (min) / <$150M/yr (target) / <$75M/yr (ideal); User security awareness: est. 30-40% literacy → >65% (min) / >80% (target) / >90% (ideal) measured by comprehension tests; Malicious transaction detection rate: est. 10% → >60% (min) / >80% (target) / >95% (ideal) via wallet warnings; Excessive approval grants: est. 70% users grant unlimited approvals → <30% (min) / <15% (target) / <5% (ideal); Drainer contract interaction rate: est. 5% of users annually → <1.5% (min) / <0.5% (target) / <0.1% (ideal); Average time to detect compromise: est. 24-48h → <4h (min) / <1h (target) / <15min (ideal)
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline Q1-Q4 2025 (12mo); Budget: $3M for transaction simulation + risk scoring, $1.5M for security education platform, $500K for phishing domain monitoring; Team: 4 FTE security engineers + 2 FTE threat researchers + 3 UX designers + 2 educators + 1 PM; Tech stack: Transaction simulation APIs (Tenderly, Alchemy, Blowfish), smart contract analyzers, domain reputation services (PhishFort, Chainabuse), browser fingerprinting, EIP-3074 transaction authorization improvements, WalletConnect security protocols; Policy: balance security warnings vs UX friction (cannot block all transactions), no custodial control (preserve self-custody), GDPR compliance for user behavior tracking; Limitations: cannot prevent determined users from signing malicious transactions (self-custody principle), must minimize false positives to avoid warning fatigue, latency <2s for transaction analysis
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     Individual wallet users (50M, need protection >95% without UX degradation, tolerance for false warnings <5%, security training time <30min), Wallet developers (500 teams, need security API integration cost <$100K/yr, accuracy >90%, latency <2s, false positive rate <5%), Security researchers (200+ analysts, need threat intelligence sharing, scam reporting tools, compensation $50-200 per validated threat), DeFi protocols (5000+ projects, need anti-phishing guidance, domain verification, official communication channels), Education platforms (need curriculum reaching 10M users/yr, comprehension >80%, cost <$3/user, engagement >60% completion rate), Phishing detection services (10+ providers, need threat feeds, domain monitoring, takedown coordination, revenue $0.01-0.05 per user/mo)
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline Q1-Q4 2025 (12mo) for initial deployment, ongoing threat monitoring and education; Systems: transaction simulation + risk scoring + domain reputation + approval management + security education + phishing alerts + wallet UX improvements; Attack vectors: Fake websites (40% of phishing), social media impersonation (25%), malicious smart contracts/drainers (20%), browser extensions (10%), other vectors (5%) [Assumption]; Blockchains: Ethereum (highest risk: 60% of DeFi TVL), Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, other EVM chains; Geographic: Global with concentration in high-crypto-adoption regions (US 30%, Europe 25%, Asia 30%, Other 15%); Scale: 50M wallet users, est. $600-800M annual phishing losses, thousands of new phishing sites daily
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2018-2020: User education campaigns (blog posts, videos) - achieved <10% reach, 20% comprehension, minimal behavior change [Assumption]. 2020-2022: Browser wallet warnings for known phishing sites - reduced losses by 15-20% but suffered from 48-72h detection lag as new sites emerged daily [Assumption]. 2022-2023: Transaction simulation previews (MetaMask Snap, Rabby Wallet) - showed promise with 40% attack detection among adopters but <5% wallet integration [Assumption]. 2023-2024: Smart contract approval managers (Revoke.cash, approved.zone) - enabled users to revoke excessive approvals but required manual vigilance; adoption <2% [Assumption]. 2024: Drainer detection services (Blowfish, Fire, Blockaid) - achieved 85-90% detection accuracy but integration limited to few wallets [Assumption]. Key lessons: (1) Reactive education (post-incident) ineffective; need contextual, just-in-time warnings. (2) Security tools available but not integrated into mainstream wallets. (3) UX friction limits adoption even when tools effective.
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: $2.2B total crypto theft in 2024 [Web: The Block, 2024]; phishing and social engineering are critical attack vectors [Web: CoinCover, 2024]; drainer contracts grant attackers unlimited token access [Web: Group-IB, 2024]; typosquatting and homograph attacks used for fake websites; single-sig wallets execute transactions immediately without review period; transaction simulation technology exists (Tenderly, Alchemy, Blowfish)
     - **Assumptions**: 30-40% of wallet compromises from phishing/social engineering (est. from security reports attributing portion of $1.7B wallet compromises); $600-800M annual phishing losses (calculated as 30-35% of $2.2B total theft); 30-40% user security literacy (extrapolated from cybersecurity awareness studies); 10% malicious transaction detection rate with current basic warnings; 70% users grant unlimited approvals (inferred from approval analysis studies); 5% interact with drainers annually; 24-48h compromise detection; attack vector distribution: fake sites 40%, social 25%, drainers 20%, extensions 10%, other 5%; historical success rates for education (10% reach, 20% comprehension), early warnings (15-20% loss reduction), simulation adoption <5%, approval managers <2%, drainer detection 85-90% accuracy
     - **Uncertainties**: True phishing loss amounts (most incidents unreported); optimal warning UX (balance protection vs friction); user behavior change drivers (what actually changes habits); acceptable false positive rate before warning fatigue; drainer detection accuracy improvement potential; educational content effectiveness (what formats/timing work); threat intelligence sharing framework; legal liability for wallets failing to warn about known threats; insurance coverage for social engineering losses; cross-industry collaboration on phishing takedowns; long-term effectiveness as attackers adapt techniques

## Glossary

- **Airdrop**: Distribution of free tokens/NFTs to wallet addresses, often used as marketing; scammers use fake airdrops to lure users to malicious sites.
- **Approval (token approval)**: Permission granted to a smart contract to spend tokens from a user's wallet; "unlimited approval" allows contract to access all tokens of that type.
- **Blowfish, Fire, Blockaid**: Security services providing real-time transaction simulation and risk scoring to detect malicious operations before execution.
- **Browser extension**: Add-on software installed in web browsers; malicious versions can intercept wallet credentials and transactions.
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Financial applications built on blockchain; complex interfaces and smart contract interactions create phishing opportunities.
- **Discord/Telegram**: Messaging platforms popular in crypto communities; attackers impersonate support staff or project teams to steal credentials.
- **Drainer contract**: Malicious smart contract that, once approved by a user, drains tokens from their wallet through excessive permissions.
- **EIP-3074**: Ethereum Improvement Proposal for enhancing transaction authorization and enabling better security controls like spending limits.
- **False positive**: Security alert incorrectly flagging legitimate transaction as malicious; high false positive rates cause "warning fatigue" where users ignore alerts.
- **Hex data**: Hexadecimal (base-16) encoded transaction details; cryptic to humans but how blockchain stores transaction information.
- **Homograph attack**: Phishing technique using Unicode characters that look like Latin letters (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' vs Latin 'a') to create fake domains.
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by impersonating legitimate entities through fake websites, emails, or messages.
- **PhishFort, Chainabuse**: Services providing threat intelligence, domain reputation scoring, and phishing site databases for crypto security.
- **Revoke.cash, approved.zone**: Tools allowing users to view and revoke excessive smart contract approvals on their wallets.
- **Seed phrase**: 12-24 word recovery phrase; legitimate services NEVER ask for seed phrases; revealing it means complete wallet compromise.
- **Smart contract**: Self-executing code on blockchain; malicious contracts can drain wallets if users grant approvals without understanding implications.
- **Social engineering**: Psychological manipulation to trick people into revealing confidential information or performing actions compromising security.
- **Transaction simulation**: Pre-execution analysis showing predicted outcome of transaction (token changes, permissions granted) in human-readable format.
- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Total value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols; higher TVL attracts more phishing attacks.
- **Typosquatting**: Registering domain names similar to legitimate sites (e.g., unisvvap.com) to catch users making typos.
- **WalletConnect**: Open protocol for connecting wallets to dApps; includes security specifications but implementations vary.
