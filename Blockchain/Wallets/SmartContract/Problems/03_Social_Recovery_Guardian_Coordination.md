1. **[IMPORTANT]** Q: Smart contract wallet social recovery mechanisms face guardian selection, coordination, and responsiveness challenges that limit adoption and recovery success rates. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     Social recovery wallets eliminate seed phrase dependency by distributing recovery authority among trusted guardians (family, friends, institutions) [Web: Yellow.com, 2024]. However, users struggle with guardian selection (trust vs. availability trade-offs), coordination complexity (threshold determination, communication), and low guardian responsiveness (estimated 30-60% participation rate in recovery scenarios). Recovery failure rates estimated at 15-35% due to insufficient guardian participation, incorrect threshold settings, or guardian unavailability. Need to increase recovery success rate from current est. 65-85% baseline to >90% by Q3 2025 through improved UX, guardian onboarding, and coordination tooling.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Social recovery eliminates single seed phrase risk by using smart contract logic where M-of-N guardians approve new signing key creation if primary key lost [Web: Yellow.com, 2024; Web: Argent, 2024]. Typical implementations: Argent wallet (3-of-5 guardians), Loopring wallet (configurable M-of-N), Safe wallet with recovery module [Web: Argent, 2024]. Guardian types include (1) Personal contacts - family/friends with high trust but variable technical competence and availability, (2) Hardware devices - user-controlled backups with high security but loss risk, (3) Institutional guardians - professional services (Argent guardian service, hardware wallet providers) with high availability but centralization concerns [Web: Yellow.com, 2024]. Current user behavior shows: guardian count averages 3-5 per wallet, threshold typically set at 50-60% (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5), recovery initiation takes 24-72 hours for users to contact guardians, guardian response time averages 3-14 days with 30-60% requiring multiple contact attempts, overall recovery completion time 7-30 days with 15-35% failure rate due to guardian unavailability or non-response [Assumption: estimated from recovery service reports and user feedback]. Technical challenges: guardian key management (guardians often unfamiliar with wallets/signatures), notification systems (reliable guardian alerting), threshold selection guidance (balancing security vs. recoverability), recovery process UX (multi-step coordination across non-technical participants).
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Recovery success rate: 65-85% → >88% (min) / >92% (target) / >97% (ideal) by Q3 2025; Guardian response time: 3-14 days avg → <5 days (min) / <3 days (target) / <24 hours (ideal); Guardian participation rate: 30-60% first contact → >60% (min) / >75% (target) / >90% (ideal); Recovery completion time: 7-30 days → <10 days (min) / <7 days (target) / <3 days (ideal); Failed recoveries due to insufficient responses: 15-35% → <12% (min) / <8% (target) / <3% (ideal); User guardian setup completion rate: est. 40-60% → >70% (min) / >85% (target) / >95% (ideal) of wallet users configure guardians; Guardian onboarding time: est. 15-45 minutes → <10 minutes (min) / <5 minutes (target) / <2 minutes (ideal).
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1-Q3 2025 (9 months); Budget: UX research and design $100K-$300K, guardian coordination tooling development $300K-$800K, notification infrastructure $50K-$150K, user education and guardian onboarding $100K-$250K; Team: UX researchers (2-3 FTE, user interview and testing expertise), Product designers (2-3 FTE, wallet UX specialization), Full-stack engineers (4-6 FTE, mobile/web development, smart contract integration), DevOps (1-2 FTE, notification infrastructure, monitoring); Tech stack: Smart contract recovery modules (Solidity, gas-optimized for recovery operations), Mobile/web wallet apps (React Native, React, Vue), Notification systems (push notifications, email, SMS), Guardian management backend (Node.js, PostgreSQL), Blockchain integration (ethers.js, viem); User constraints: Non-technical guardians with limited crypto knowledge, guardian availability not guaranteed (travel, time zones, digital literacy), trust relationships vary (family intimacy vs. institutional professionalism); Social constraints: Users reluctant to burden friends/family with responsibility, privacy concerns about revealing wallet holdings to guardians, cultural differences in trust network structures; Technical constraints: On-chain recovery gas costs ($10-$50 per recovery operation on mainnet), guardian signature collection mechanisms (on-chain vs. off-chain coordination), threshold modification security (preventing malicious threshold reduction).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     Wallet users (estimated 5M-10M potential social recovery users, need recovery success >90% probability, setup time <15 minutes, avoid burdening guardians excessively), Guardians (est. 15M-50M individuals serving as guardians, need simple onboarding <5 minutes, clear instructions for recovery process, minimal ongoing responsibility <30 min per year), Wallet providers (est. 20-40 projects implementing social recovery, need competitive recovery success rates >90%, user setup completion >80%, guardian satisfaction scores >4/5), Institutional guardian services (est. 5-10 providers like Argent guardian, need operational scalability >100K users per service, response SLA <24 hours, security incident rate <0.01%), UX researchers (wallet ecosystem, need validated design patterns, user study data for guardian selection and recovery flows), Smart contract developers (recovery module implementers, need standardized recovery interfaces, gas-optimized implementations <150K gas per recovery, security audit requirements).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1-Q3 2025 (9 months design, development, and pilot deployment); Systems affected: Social recovery smart contract modules, guardian management systems, notification infrastructure (push, email, SMS), wallet mobile/web applications, guardian onboarding flows, recovery coordination UX; Chains: Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon), EVM-compatible chains; Scale: 5M-10M potential users (subset of smart contract wallet users where social recovery adds value over hardware wallets or institutional custody), 15M-50M potential guardians (3-5 guardians per wallet user), est. 50K-200K recovery operations annually (assuming 1-4% annual recovery rate among users), estimated 20-40 wallet projects implementing social recovery features.
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     Multiple approaches implemented: (1) Argent wallet pioneered social recovery with 3-of-5 guardian model including Argent guardian service - achieved high security but user setup completion estimated <50% due to guardian coordination complexity and onboarding friction; (2) Loopring wallet offered configurable M-of-N with flexible threshold - provided flexibility but increased user decision burden, threshold selection errors led to unrecoverable wallets (threshold set too high relative to guardian responsiveness); (3) Gnosis Safe recovery modules - powerful but required technical expertise, setup completion <30% among non-technical users; (4) Hardware wallet as guardian approach (Ledger, Trezor) - improved reliability but required users to maintain physical devices, reintroduced single-point-of-failure if hardware lost/damaged alongside primary key; (5) Institutional guardian services - high reliability (>95% response rate) but centralization concerns and monthly fees ($5-$15) limited adoption; (6) Email/SMS recovery verification - improved guardian UX but introduced security trade-offs (account takeover risks, SMS vulnerabilities). Key lessons: Guardian selection guidance critical to balance trust/availability/technical competence; Threshold defaults matter enormously - 2-of-3 more recoverable than 3-of-5 but less secure against collusion; Institutional guardians improve reliability but reduce decentralization; Non-technical guardian onboarding biggest UX challenge; Recovery testing/simulation valuable but rarely used by users; Hybrid models (personal + institutional guardians) show promising balance.
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: Social recovery eliminates seed phrase dependency through guardian-based key recovery [Web: Yellow.com, 2024]; Argent uses 3-of-5 guardian model [Web: Argent, 2024]; Guardians can include family, friends, trusted institutions [Web: Yellow.com, 2024]; If user loses primary key, guardians collectively authorize new signing key creation [Web: Yellow.com, 2024].
     - **Assumptions**: Recovery success rate 65-85% (estimated from wallet provider reports and user community feedback indicating 15-35% failure rate due to guardian non-response or insufficient threshold); Guardian response time 3-14 days (inferred from recovery service case studies and user support ticket timelines); Guardian participation rate 30-60% (estimated from recovery initiation reports showing multiple contact attempts needed); Recovery completion time 7-30 days (based on recovery process walkthroughs and user reports); User guardian setup completion 40-60% (estimated from wallet analytics showing percentage of users who complete guardian configuration vs. skip); Guardian onboarding time 15-45 minutes (based on UX studies of guardian setup flows); Annual recovery rate 1-4% of wallet users (estimated from loss/theft statistics and comparison to traditional wallet recovery requests); Guardian count typically 3-5, threshold 50-60% (observed from deployed wallet guardian configurations).
     - **Uncertainties**: Exact recovery failure rates across different wallet implementations and user demographics; True guardian response time distribution (median, p90, p99) and factors affecting responsiveness; Optimal guardian count and threshold recommendations for different user security/convenience profiles; User willingness to burden friends/family with guardian responsibilities; Guardian retention rates over time (do guardians maintain access to their keys?); Effectiveness of guardian simulation/testing features in improving real recovery success; Security vs. usability trade-offs in different guardian selection strategies; Cultural differences in trust network structures and guardian selection patterns; Long-term institutional guardian service sustainability and pricing models; Impact of guardian education and ongoing engagement on recovery success rates; Real recovery success rates for different guardian combinations (personal only, institutional only, hybrid).

## Glossary

- **Social Recovery**: Wallet recovery mechanism using trusted guardians (family, friends, institutions) who collectively authorize new signing key creation if primary key lost, eliminating single seed phrase dependency while preserving user sovereignty.
- **Guardian**: Trusted individual or service holding recovery authority for social recovery wallet. Signs recovery transactions when threshold met (M-of-N). Types include personal contacts, hardware devices, institutional services.
- **M-of-N Threshold**: Recovery approval requirement where M signatures out of N total guardians needed to authorize new key creation. Common configurations: 2-of-3 (67% threshold), 3-of-5 (60% threshold). Balances security against collusion vs. recoverability against unavailability.
- **Guardian Participation Rate**: Percentage of contacted guardians who successfully respond and sign recovery transactions within target timeframe. Current baseline estimated 30-60%. Critical metric for recovery success.
- **Recovery Success Rate**: Percentage of initiated recovery operations that successfully restore wallet access. Current baseline estimated 65-85%. Failures due to insufficient guardian responses, incorrect threshold, technical errors.
- **Institutional Guardian**: Professional guardian service (e.g., Argent guardian, hardware wallet provider) offering high availability (>95% response rate) and technical expertise. Trade-off: centralization concerns vs. reliability benefits.
- **Guardian Onboarding**: Process of adding guardian to wallet configuration, including guardian key generation/registration, relationship verification, recovery process education. Current time estimated 15-45 minutes, target <5 minutes.
- **Recovery Completion Time**: Duration from recovery initiation to successful wallet access restoration. Includes guardian contact time, signature collection, and on-chain recovery transaction. Current baseline 7-30 days, target <3 days.
- **Seed Phrase**: 12-24 word mnemonic backup enabling wallet recovery. Traditional single-point-of-failure that social recovery aims to eliminate. Risks: loss, theft, inheritance complications, memorization difficulty.
- **Threshold Selection**: User decision process determining M-of-N recovery requirement. Critical trade-off: higher threshold (3-of-5) more secure against collusion but harder to recover; lower threshold (2-of-3) easier recovery but less secure.
