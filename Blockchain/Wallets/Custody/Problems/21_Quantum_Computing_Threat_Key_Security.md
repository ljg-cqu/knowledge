# Quantum Computing Threat to Custody Key Security

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[Important]** Q: An institutional blockchain custody wallet provider must prepare for quantum computing threats that could break current elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, Ed25519, BLS) used in custody key management, potentially enabling future attackers to forge signatures or derive private keys from public keys, compromising assets worth billions across institutional portfolios within the 5-15 year quantum threat horizon.

   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Quantum computers threaten to break the elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, Ed25519, BLS) that secures custody wallet private keys and signatures for all major blockchains, potentially exposing assets to "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks where adversaries collect blockchain data today to crack keys when quantum computers mature in 5-15 years; institutional custodians holding $500M-50B+ in client assets must transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards within a 2-5 year timeline to maintain security guarantees, but face challenges with blockchain protocol support, performance overhead, and coordinating migrations across 50+ chains without service disruption or key compromise.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: As of August 2024, NIST finalized the first three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards—FIPS 203 (CRYSTALS-KYBER for encryption), FIPS 204 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures), and FIPS 205 (SPHINCS+ for signatures)—designed to resist quantum computer attacks [Standards Release: NIST, 2024-08]. Current blockchain custody relies on ECDSA (Bitcoin, Ethereum, most EVM chains), Ed25519 (Solana, Cardano, Polkadot), and BLS signatures (Ethereum consensus, many PoS chains), all vulnerable to Shor's algorithm which can solve discrete logarithm problems on quantum computers in polynomial time [Cryptographic Analysis: NIST PQC Project, 2024]. The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) threat model means adversaries can record blockchain transaction data and public keys today, then decrypt/forge signatures once sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge (estimated 2030-2040 for cryptographically relevant quantum computers, though some experts warn earlier) [Threat Model: SEC PQFIF Framework, 2025]. MPC wallet market reports explicitly cite quantum computing as a key challenge facing the $61.4M (2024) custody technology sector [Market Analysis: Intel Market Research, 2024]. Unlike centralized systems that can upgrade cryptography behind APIs, blockchain custody must coordinate with base layer protocol upgrades, potentially requiring hard forks, new address formats, and multi-year transition periods that expose assets to risks during migration.
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Within 24-36 months, develop and deploy a quantum-resistant custody wallet strategy that protects institutional client assets against quantum threats throughout the transition period and post-quantum era, with target metrics including: 100% of new custody addresses generated using hybrid classical/post-quantum signature schemes by Q2 2026; migrate ≥80% of existing high-value assets (>$10M per wallet) to post-quantum protected addresses by Q4 2027; reduce quantum attack surface to <5% of total assets under custody by Q1 2028; maintain signing performance within 2x current latency (<1s standard, <3s complex transactions); achieve compatibility with ≥90% of institutional client use cases (staking, DeFi, cross-chain) despite PQC overhead; complete third-party cryptographic audits (Trail of Bits, NCC Group) validating hybrid classical/PQC implementation; align with NIST PQC standards and SEC Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF); zero security incidents or asset losses attributable to quantum or quantum-hybrid cryptographic implementation errors.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Timeline: 24-36 months for research, implementation, testing, audit, and phased deployment before estimated quantum threat materialization (5-15 years, conservatively 2030+); Budget: $500K-1.5M for R&D + $200K-500K for audits + ongoing operational costs; Team: 4-6 cryptographic engineers with PQC expertise + 2-3 blockchain protocol specialists + 1-2 security auditors + 0.5 PM; Technical constraints: most blockchain protocols do not natively support PQC signatures (signature sizes 2-10x larger, verification 2-50x slower depending on algorithm); hybrid schemes (dual classical + PQC signatures) double signature overhead; must support 50+ blockchains with different cryptographic primitives and upgrade timelines; cannot break backward compatibility with existing custody infrastructure or client integrations; MPC implementations must adapt threshold signature protocols to PQC lattice-based or hash-based schemes with limited production implementations; regulatory requirement to maintain continuous custody without gaps during transition; client expectation of zero downtime or asset migration risks.
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Institutional clients (custody $500M-50B in assets, require long-term security guarantees through 2040+, sensitive to migration risks and costs), cryptographic engineering team (design hybrid classical/PQC schemes, implement MPC-compatible PQC protocols, target <3s signing latency), blockchain protocol foundations (Bitcoin Core, Ethereum Foundation, Solana Labs, etc., control base layer PQC upgrade timelines spanning 2-10 years), regulators and compliance officers (SEC PQFIF framework mandates transition to quantum-resistant systems, NIST standards compliance required [Regulatory Framework: SEC PQFIF, 2025]), security auditors (validate cryptographic implementation correctness, assess quantum attack surface, require formal verification for novel PQC-MPC combinations), operations teams (execute asset migrations, manage dual signing infrastructure, handle client communication about PQC transition), industry custodian peers (coordinate on standards and migration best practices to avoid fragmented approaches that complicate cross-custodian asset transfers).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 2-5 year planning and transition horizon before quantum threat becomes material (conservative estimate 2030-2040 for cryptographically relevant quantum computers capable of breaking ECC), affecting 100% of institutional custody wallet infrastructure, all blockchain protocols in use, and total assets under custody ranging from hundreds of millions to tens of billions USD; immediate term (2025-2027): R&D, pilot hybrid implementations, begin new address generation with PQC; mid-term (2027-2030): migrate majority of high-value assets, coordinate with blockchain protocol PQC upgrades, maintain dual classical/PQC signing; long-term (2030-2040+): fully PQC custody as quantum threat matures, decommission classical-only systems; failure to transition exposes entire institutional crypto custody industry to existential quantum decryption risk once threshold quantum computers emerge, potentially enabling retroactive theft of assets via forged signatures or private key derivation from public keys recorded on-chain.
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Early blockchain quantum resistance discussions (2015-2020) focused on theoretical PQC research but lacked standardized algorithms; NIST PQC standardization process (2016-2024) converged on CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-KYBER, and SPHINCS+ after extensive cryptanalysis [Standards History: NIST, 2024]. Some projects explored hash-based signatures (QRL using XMSS since 2018) but faced adoption challenges due to stateful signature limitations and performance [Implementation: QRL Foundation, 2018-2024]. Ethereum researchers proposed EIP drafts for PQC signature support but implementation remains years away pending protocol research and hard fork coordination [Research: Ethereum Foundation, 2023-2024]. BTQ Technologies announced quantum-safe Bitcoin using NIST PQC standards in October 2025, demonstrating proof-of-concept implementations but not production deployment [Innovation: BTQ Technologies, 2025-10]. Current custodians are largely in early planning stages, with hybrid classical/PQC schemes (both signature types required for transition period) emerging as pragmatic approach to maintain backward compatibility while adding quantum resistance [Industry Practice: Custody Providers Survey, 2024-2025]. Key lesson: blockchain protocol upgrade timelines (2-10 years for major changes) mean custody wallet providers must begin PQC transition well before quantum threat materializes, accepting interim hybrid complexity and overhead to avoid future irreversible asset exposure.
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: NIST released final PQC standards FIPS 203, 204, 205 in August 2024 specifying quantum-resistant algorithms [Standards: NIST, 2024-08]; SEC Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework (PQFIF) mandates transition to quantum-resistant systems for financial infrastructure [Regulatory: SEC PQFIF, 2025]; all major blockchain custody solutions currently use quantum-vulnerable ECDSA, Ed25519, or BLS signatures [Cryptographic Audit: Industry Analysis, 2024]; PQC signature sizes range 2-10x larger than ECDSA (e.g., Dilithium 2420 bytes vs. ECDSA 64-72 bytes), verification 2-50x slower [Performance Benchmarks: NIST PQC, 2024]; cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) capable of breaking 256-bit ECC estimated to require 10^6 to 10^7 physical qubits with error correction, likely 2030-2040+ timeline with high uncertainty [Quantum Computing Timeline: Industry Expert Consensus, 2024]; "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks already feasible for state actors and organized crime to record blockchain data for future quantum decryption [Threat Intelligence: SEC PQFIF, 2025].
     - **Assumptions**: Institutional custodians have 5-15 year window to transition to PQC before quantum threat materializes (conservative 2030 estimate); blockchain protocols will successfully implement PQC support within 5-10 years for major chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) though coordination challenges may delay; hybrid classical/PQC signature schemes will provide secure transition path without introducing new cryptographic vulnerabilities; clients will accept 2-3x performance overhead and migration costs to eliminate quantum risk; NIST PQC algorithms (Dilithium, KYBER, SPHINCS+) will not suffer major cryptanalytic breaks in next 5-10 years requiring re-standardization; regulatory pressure (SEC PQFIF) will accelerate industry-wide PQC adoption and protocol upgrades.
     - **Uncertainties**: Exact timeline for cryptographically relevant quantum computers (estimates range 2030-2050, some warn earlier breakthroughs possible); whether unforeseen cryptanalytic advances will break NIST PQC algorithms before quantum computers emerge (classical attacks on lattice or hash-based schemes); blockchain community consensus timeline for PQC hard forks on major chains (Bitcoin Core's conservative upgrade process may take 10+ years); optimal hybrid signature scheme design balancing security, performance, and compatibility; how to handle legacy addresses with quantum-vulnerable keys during transition (mandatory migrations vs. voluntary with sunset dates); client willingness to pay for PQC transition costs and accept UX degradation; whether "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks have already begun at scale; regulatory enforcement timeline for PQFIF compliance; emergence of alternative PQC approaches (e.g., isogeny-based cryptography) that might supersede current NIST standards.
