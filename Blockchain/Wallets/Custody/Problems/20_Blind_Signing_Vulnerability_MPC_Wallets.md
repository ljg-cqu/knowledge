# Blind Signing Vulnerability in MPC Custody Wallets

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: An institutional blockchain custody wallet provider using MPC/threshold signature architecture faces the blind signing problem, where signers approve transactions without fully understanding their content or implications, potentially authorizing fraudulent withdrawals or malicious smart contract interactions that bypass technical security controls.

   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: MPC custody wallets that distribute signing authority across multiple parties face a critical "blind signing" vulnerability where signers cannot independently verify transaction details (recipient, amount, smart contract logic) before approving, enabling attackers who compromise approval workflows or social engineer signers to execute unauthorized transactions worth hundreds of millions despite correct cryptographic implementation.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets have become the institutional standard for crypto custody as of 2024-2025, valued at $61.4M market size in 2024 with 8.1% CAGR to reach $120M by 2031 [Market Research: Intel Market Research, 2024]. However, most MPC implementations present signers with opaque transaction hashes or encoded data rather than human-readable details, forcing approval decisions on cryptographic signatures without semantic understanding [Security Analysis: Hypernative, 2025]. This "blind signing" gap means that even with distributed key shares and UC-secure protocols like CGGMP21, an attacker who compromises the transaction construction layer or social engineers multiple signers can drain institutional custody wallets by presenting malicious transactions disguised as legitimate operations. Industry reports show that over 80% of $2.2B stolen in 2024 blockchain attacks involved compromised accounts and social engineering rather than pure cryptographic breaks [Security Report: Halborn, 2024], indicating that blind signing creates an operational attack surface that undermines MPC's cryptographic guarantees.
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Within 6-12 months, eliminate blind signing by implementing transaction verification mechanisms that enable every MPC signer to independently validate transaction semantics (recipient addresses, amounts, contract interactions, risk scores) before signing, with target metrics including: 100% of high-value transactions (>$100K) must display human-readable details to all signers; reduce unauthorized transaction approval rate from current estimated 0.1-0.5% of flagged transactions to <0.01%; achieve zero successful social engineering attacks that result in asset loss via blind signing; maintain signing latency <2s for standard transactions and <10s for complex DeFi interactions; pass third-party security audits (Trail of Bits, Kudelski) demonstrating elimination of blind signing attack vectors.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Timeline: 6-12 months for design, implementation, and audit; Budget: $200K-500K for development + $50K-100K for audits; Team: 3-4 security engineers with MPC expertise + 1-2 UX designers + 0.5 PM; Technical constraints: must support 50+ blockchains with different transaction formats (EVM, UTXO, account-based), smart contract ABIs, and DeFi protocols; maintain backward compatibility with existing MPC infrastructure and signing flows; operate within existing signing latency SLAs (<500ms for most transactions); must not compromise MPC security guarantees or introduce new key exposure risks; regulatory requirement to maintain audit trails for all transaction approvals; cannot require signers to have deep blockchain expertise or manually decode hex.
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: MPC signing participants (institutional custodian staff, need clear transaction details in <5 seconds, handle 100-1000 signing requests/day, cannot decode raw hex or ABI), security and risk teams (need to detect anomalous transactions, block malicious approvals, target <0.01% false positive rate), institutional clients (custody $500M-5B in assets, require zero-loss guarantee, demand transaction transparency for regulatory reporting), compliance officers (must demonstrate controls to auditors, need complete approval audit trails), attackers/threat actors (exploit blind signing via compromised transaction construction, social engineering, or malicious DeFi integrations), external auditors and regulators (validate that custody controls prevent unauthorized transactions even with distributed signing).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 6-18 month horizon to design, deploy, and validate blind signing mitigation across all institutional custody wallet infrastructure, affecting 100% of MPC signing operations for assets ranging from hundreds of millions to billions USD under custody; immediate impact on daily signing volumes of 100-1000+ institutional transactions; a single successful blind signing exploit could result in losses of $10M-500M+ based on typical institutional transaction sizes and historical custody failures; long-term impact on institutional confidence in MPC custody as a bank-grade solution, with potential to unlock or block tens of billions in institutional capital allocation to digital assets.
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Early MPC implementations presented raw transaction hashes with no semantic validation, relying entirely on policy engines and multi-approval workflows outside the signing interface [Implementation Analysis: Fireblocks, 2024]. Some custodians implemented basic transaction detail displays (address, amount) but could not verify smart contract interactions or detect address poisoning attacks [Security Gap: Safeheron, 2024]. Recent 2024-2025 solutions are exploring transaction simulation and risk scoring engines that pre-execute transactions on local nodes and present outcome predictions to signers [Innovation Report: Hypernative, 2025], but these face challenges with accuracy for complex DeFi interactions, performance overhead, and maintaining security boundaries between simulation and signing. Policy-based whitelisting (known addresses/contracts) reduces blind signing risk but limits institutional flexibility for new DeFi strategies and cross-chain operations. Key lesson: transaction verification must balance security (comprehensive validation), usability (clear presentation to non-expert signers), and performance (sub-second latency for standard operations).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: MPC wallet market $61.4M in 2024, projected $120M by 2031 at 8.1% CAGR [Market Research: Intel Market Research, 2024]; blind signing identified as critical security gap in 2025 MPC custody analysis [Security Analysis: Hypernative, 2025]; 80% of $2.2B stolen in 2024 blockchain attacks involved compromised accounts and social engineering rather than cryptographic breaks [Security Report: Halborn, 2024]; institutional custody transactions typically range $100K-50M per transaction based on asset management flows; transaction simulation can detect 70-90% of malicious smart contract interactions in testing environments [Security Testing: Industry Practice, 2024].
     - **Assumptions**: Transaction simulation on local nodes can accurately predict outcomes for 95%+ of standard EVM transactions and 80-90% of complex DeFi interactions without introducing new attack vectors; signers will accept 2-10s latency increase for high-value transactions (>$1M) in exchange for transaction transparency; institutional clients will pay 20-30% premium for custody solutions that eliminate blind signing; regulatory frameworks will increasingly require transaction-level validation capabilities for qualified custodians; attacker sophistication in exploiting blind signing will increase with AI-enabled social engineering and deepfake capabilities.
     - **Uncertainties**: Optimal UX for presenting complex smart contract logic to non-expert signers without overwhelming or introducing new approval fatigue risks; whether transaction simulation can maintain security boundaries against adversarial inputs designed to exploit simulation-signing gaps; performance impact of full transaction verification on signing latency for cross-chain and Layer-2 operations; how to handle novel DeFi protocols and contract patterns not in training data for risk models; regulatory acceptance of simulation-based verification vs. formal verification methods; whether standardized transaction verification frameworks will emerge across MPC providers or remain proprietary implementations.

## Glossary

- **Blind signing**: A vulnerability in MPC and multisig wallets where signers approve cryptographic signatures for transactions without the ability to independently verify the semantic content (recipient, amount, contract logic), enabling social engineering and compromised transaction construction to bypass signing controls.
- **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)**: Cryptographic technique that distributes private key operations across multiple parties so that no single party ever possesses the complete key, eliminating single points of cryptographic failure in custody wallets.
- **Transaction simulation**: Pre-execution of blockchain transactions in isolated environments to predict outcomes (balance changes, contract interactions, risk indicators) before signing, enabling validation of transaction semantics.
- **UC-secure protocol**: Universally Composable security model that provides formal guarantees for cryptographic protocols like MPC even when composed with other protocols and in the presence of malicious adversaries (e.g., CGGMP21).
- **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**: Specification for encoding and decoding data when interacting with smart contracts, required for interpreting transaction data but not human-readable without tooling.
- **Address poisoning**: Attack technique where adversary creates addresses visually similar to legitimate addresses to trick users into sending funds to attacker-controlled wallets.
- **Signing latency**: Time from transaction submission to cryptographic signature completion, critical metric for institutional custody user experience (target: <500ms standard, <2s complex).
