## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: Blind signing—users signing blockchain transactions without seeing or understanding complete transaction details—represents a fundamental security vulnerability exploited in 60-75% of wallet phishing attacks, causing $200-400M annual losses as users unknowingly authorize malicious transfers, unlimited token approvals, smart contract delegations, or account control transfers (EIP-7702), with hardware wallets, mobile wallets, and complex DeFi interactions particularly vulnerable due to limited display capabilities and transaction opacity. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.

   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Blind signing enables users to sign transactions without understanding full details (recipient addresses, token amounts, smart contract function calls, state changes), causing 60-75% of successful phishing attacks and $200-400M annual losses. Root causes: (1) Hardware wallet display limitations (4-16 line screens cannot show full transaction data); (2) Complex smart contract interactions (encoded function calls, proxy contracts, delegate calls unreadable to users); (3) Wallet UX that shows raw hex data or simplified summaries hiding critical details; (4) Emerging EIP-7702 phishing attacks (users unknowingly delegate account control via EOA-to-contract conversion); (5) MPC wallet blind signing gaps (transaction details not verified across all signing parties). Need to reduce blind signing rate from 65-80% of transactions to <20% and blind-signing-related losses from $200-400M to <$50M annually by Q4 2025.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: Transaction signing process: User initiates action (send tokens, interact with DApp) → Wallet constructs transaction (to address, value, data field with encoded function call, gas parameters) → Wallet displays transaction preview → User confirms/signs → Transaction broadcast to blockchain [Process: Standard Wallet Transaction Flow]. Blind signing occurs when transaction preview inadequate: (1) **Hardware wallets** (Ledger, Trezor): Small screens (128×64 to 480×800 pixels) limit display, showing only partial addresses (first/last 4-6 characters), truncated data fields, unable to decode complex smart contract interactions; "blind signing" setting must be manually enabled for most DApp interactions, warning users of risk but offering no alternative [Research: Hardware Wallet UX Study, 2024]; (2) **Mobile/browser wallets** (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet): Display limitations on mobile screens, raw hex data shown for contract interactions (e.g., "0x095ea7b3..."), users cannot understand function being called, popular wallets only recently added transaction simulation features (MetaMask simulation 2023, adoption <30%) [Analytics: Wallet Transaction Simulation Adoption, 2024-Q4]; (3) **Complex DeFi interactions**: Multi-step transactions (swap + liquidity provision, flash loans), proxy contract patterns (implementation behind proxy, display shows proxy not logic contract), delegate calls (contract executes in context of user's wallet), batch transactions (multiple operations in single signature), encoded parameters (token IDs, amounts, addresses packed in hex) [Report: DeFi Transaction Complexity Analysis, 2024]; (4) **Emerging EIP-7702 phishing** (introduced Ethereum Pectra upgrade 2024): Allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily delegate control to smart contract, phishing sites trick users into signing EIP-7702 transactions that convert their EOA into contract-controlled account enabling arbitrary fund transfers [Analysis: EIP-7702 Phishing Risks, 2025-Q2; Report: GoPlus Security EIP-7702 Guide, 2025]; (5) **MPC wallet blind signing gaps**: Multi-party computation wallets split signing across parties, but if transaction details not verified by all parties independently (only signing cryptographic shares), compromised party can insert malicious transaction [Report: Hypernative MPC Blind Signing Gap, 2025]; (6) **Address poisoning combined with blind signing**: Attackers send dust transactions from visually similar addresses (matching first/last characters), users copying from transaction history and blind signing send to attacker address [Report: Address Poisoning Attacks, 2024]. Current impact: Blind signing exploitation in 60-75% of successful phishing attacks (users approve unlimited token spending, transfer NFTs to attacker, delegate control) [Analytics: Phishing Attack Vector Analysis, 2025]; estimated $200-400M annual losses directly attributable to blind signing (subset of total $880M+ phishing/social engineering losses) [Analysis: Blind Signing Loss Attribution, 2024]; 65-80% of all DeFi transactions involve some degree of blind signing (users cannot fully understand contract interaction details) [Survey: User Transaction Comprehension, 2024-Q3]; 85-90% of hardware wallet DApp interactions require enabling blind signing setting [Survey: Hardware Wallet User Behavior, 2024]. Mitigation attempts: Transaction simulation previews (Rabby Wallet, MetaMask, Rainbow) show expected balance changes, token approvals, NFT transfers before signing, reducing blind signing risk 40-50% but adoption <30% of users due to UX friction and simulation backend costs [Analytics: Transaction Simulation Effectiveness, 2024-Q4]; Ledger "Clear Signing" initiative (2024-2025) works with DApp developers to provide structured transaction data that hardware wallets can display human-readable, but requires per-DApp integration and adoption <15% of top DApps [Report: Ledger Clear Signing Adoption, 2025]; Wallet transaction warnings for high-risk patterns (unusual recipient, large approval amounts, contract delegations) but 60-70% of users bypass warnings [Analytics: Warning Bypass Rates, 2025-Q1].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Blind signing rate for critical transactions (large transfers >$1000, unlimited approvals, control delegation): 65-80% → <30% (min) / <20% (target) / <10% (ideal) by Q4 2025; Annual blind-signing-related losses: $200-400M → <$150M (min) / <$50M (target) / <$20M (ideal) by 2026; Transaction simulation adoption: <30% users → >60% (min) / >75% (target) / >90% (ideal) in major wallets; Hardware wallet clear signing support: <15% DApps → >50% (min) / >70% (target) / >90% (ideal) of top 500 DApps by Q3 2026; User comprehension of transaction details pre-signing: 15-20% → >60% (min) / >75% (target) / >90% (ideal) measured by post-signature comprehension test; EIP-7702 phishing prevention: 0% wallet support (new attack) → >95% (target) wallets warn or block unauthorized delegation by Q2 2025; MPC wallet blind signing elimination: current 40-50% MPC implementations vulnerable → <10% (target) / <5% (ideal) via mandatory multi-party verification by Q4 2025; Warning bypass rate for high-risk transactions: 60-70% → <30% (min) / <20% (target) / <10% (ideal) through improved UX and friction; Address verification accuracy: 30-40% users verify full addresses → >80% (min) / >90% (target) / >95% (ideal) through better display and tooling
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Timeline Q1 2025-Q4 2025 (12mo for wallet UX improvements and clear signing adoption), Q1 2025-Q4 2026 (24mo for DApp ecosystem integration); Budget per wallet provider $300K-$1M for transaction simulation infrastructure (backend API, smart contract decoding, balance change calculation), per DApp $30K-$100K for clear signing integration (structured transaction data APIs); Technical constraints: Hardware wallet display limitations (screen size, refresh rate, cannot show full smart contract source code), transaction simulation computational cost ($0.01-$0.05 per simulation, 10M daily transactions = $100K-$500K/day), smart contract interaction complexity (cannot simulate all edge cases, oracles and external calls add uncertainty), blockchain diversity (different VM architectures: EVM, SVM, CosmWasm, Move require separate decoders), proxy contract patterns obscure implementation (display shows proxy address not logic contract address), batch/multi-step transactions difficult to simulate accurately; User behavior challenges: Signature fatigue (frequent transaction signing reduces attention), limited technical literacy (70-80% users don't understand smart contract concepts), trust in familiar brands (users assume legitimate sites safe, enabling phishing), time pressure (DeFi arbitrage, NFT minting create urgency reducing review), mobile device usage (75-85% wallet interactions on mobile with smaller screens) [Survey: Wallet User Device Preferences, 2024]; Hardware wallet constraints: Cannot upgrade display hardware on existing devices (millions of devices with small screens already sold), clear signing requires DApp developer cooperation (wallet vendors cannot unilaterally fix), backward compatibility (must support legacy DApps without clear signing), supply chain security for firmware updates (malicious update could enable blind signing exploits); DApp developer constraints: Clear signing integration requires development effort, fragmented wallet ecosystem (must integrate with 10+ major wallets separately), smart contract upgrades may break clear signing metadata, gas costs for on-chain metadata storage prohibitive; Regulatory uncertainty: Unclear liability for wallet providers enabling blind signing (is it negligence or unavoidable technical limitation?), transaction simulation accuracy expectations (if simulation wrong and user loses funds, who is liable?), EIP-7702 regulatory classification (does delegation trigger custodial or security definitions?)
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Individual wallet users (100M+ crypto users, need <10s transaction review time, >95% comprehension of transaction effects, <0.1% blind-signing loss risk, clear warnings for high-risk transactions), Hardware wallet manufacturers (5+ major vendors including Ledger, Trezor, need clear signing API standards, DApp developer adoption >70%, firmware update security, screen size constraints balanced with security, manufacturing cost <$50 additional for larger screens), Software wallet developers (200+ providers, need transaction simulation infrastructure cost <$100K/month operational, smart contract decoding libraries for 20+ blockchains, UX that surfaces risks without friction, warning bypass rate <20%, user retention >85% despite added friction), DApp developers (5000+ DApps, 1000+ requiring transaction signing, need clear signing integration effort <50 dev-hours per DApp, structured transaction metadata standards, gas-efficient on-chain metadata if required, backward compatibility with non-clear-signing wallets), Smart contract auditors (100+ audit firms, need clear signing metadata verification in audit scope, transaction simulation accuracy validation, malicious metadata detection, phishing pattern recognition in contract logic), Transaction simulation providers (Tenderly, Alchemy Simulation, Blocknative, need API accuracy >98%, coverage of 95%+ smart contracts, latency <500ms, pricing sustainability at scale $0.01-$0.05/simulation, multi-chain support 20+ blockchains), Security researchers (500+ active researchers, need phishing pattern databases, EIP-7702 vulnerability disclosure protocols, address poisoning detection tools, bug bounties $10K-$100K for blind signing exploits), Blockchain protocol developers (Ethereum Foundation, Solana Foundation, others, need transaction format standards supporting clear signing, EIP-7702 phishing mitigations at protocol level, developer education resources), Insurance providers (20+ crypto insurance firms, need blind signing risk assessment, policy exclusions for user-signed malicious transactions vs exploits, claim validation procedures, premium adjustments for wallet security features)
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Timeline Q1 2025-Q4 2026 (24mo evaluation period); Affected systems: Hardware wallet firmware and display interfaces, software wallet transaction preview UX, transaction simulation backends (API infrastructure, smart contract decoders), DApp frontend transaction request flows, blockchain explorers (address verification tools), phishing detection systems, wallet security warnings and risk scoring, EIP-7702 transaction monitoring, MPC wallet transaction verification protocols; Geographic scope: Global with concentration matching wallet adoption (North America 35% users, Europe 25%, Asia-Pacific 30%, other regions 10%); Scale: 100M+ wallet users, 65-80% blind signing rate (65M-80M users affected), $200-400M annual losses, 5+ major hardware wallet vendors, 200+ software wallet providers, 5000+ DApps (1000+ requiring signing), 10M+ daily transactions (6.5M-8M involving some blind signing), <30% transaction simulation adoption, <15% clear signing DApp support, 60-75% of phishing attacks exploit blind signing, $0.01-$0.05 per simulation cost ($100K-$500K daily at scale), 85-90% hardware wallet DApp interactions require manual blind signing enable; Priority transaction types: Token approvals (unlimited ERC-20/ERC-721 spending, 40% of blind signing exploits), control delegation (EIP-7702, multi-sig, proxy contract upgrades, 25% of exploits), large transfers (>$1000, address verification failures, 20% of exploits), DeFi batch operations (multi-step swaps, flash loans, 15% of exploits)
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Previous mitigation evolution: (1) **Early hardware wallets** (2014-2018): Simple transaction display (recipient address, amount, fee) adequate for basic transfers but blind signing for all smart contract interactions [Report: Hardware Wallet Evolution, 2019]; (2) **Blind signing warnings** (2019-2021): Ledger and Trezor added "Blind signing disabled" default requiring manual enable for DApp interactions, reduced casual exposure but users enabling setting without understanding risk, no reduction in sophisticated phishing [Analytics: Blind Signing Setting Usage, 2022]; (3) **Wallet transaction summaries** (2020-2022): MetaMask, Trust Wallet show human-readable summaries ("Approve XYZ token for ABC protocol") but summaries incomplete (don't show unlimited amounts) or incorrect (generic "Contract Interaction" label), users develop false sense of security [Report: Transaction Summary Accuracy Study, 2023]; (4) **Transaction simulation** (2022-2024): Rabby Wallet (2022), MetaMask (2023), Rainbow added pre-signature simulation showing balance changes, NFT transfers, approvals; reduced blind signing losses 40-50% for adoption cohort but <30% overall adoption due to simulation backend costs ($100K-$500K/mo for large wallet), simulation failures on complex contracts causing user frustration, added latency 0.5-2s [Analytics: Transaction Simulation Effectiveness, 2024-Q4]; (5) **Ledger Clear Signing initiative** (2024-present): Hardware wallet vendor working with DApps (Uniswap, Aave, Lido, others) to provide structured transaction metadata (JSON format) that Ledger can display human-readable ("Swap 1.5 ETH for ≥3000 USDC"), requires per-DApp integration, <15% of top 500 DApps supported, backward compatibility challenges [Report: Ledger Clear Signing Adoption, 2025]; (6) **EIP-3770 address QR encoding** (2021-present): Standard for QR codes including chain ID and checksum to prevent wrong-chain sends and address typos, but adoption <10% of wallets and DApps, users still manually copying addresses [Survey: QR Code Adoption, 2024]; (7) **Wallet security warnings** (2023-present): Major wallets added warnings for high-risk patterns (new address, large approval, unusual contract), machine learning-based phishing detection, but 60-70% of users bypass warnings (habituation, false positives reducing trust), attackers adapt to avoid triggers [Analytics: Warning Bypass Rates, 2025-Q1]. Current best practices with gaps: (1) **Address book** feature in wallets (save trusted addresses with labels) has <20% adoption, users prefer copying from explorers/chat [Survey: Address Book Usage, 2024]; (2) **Manual address verification** (comparing first/last characters) is error-prone against address poisoning, only 30-40% users consistently verify [Survey: Address Verification Behavior, 2024]; (3) **ENS/domain names** (human-readable names like "vitalik.eth") improve address verification but <5% of transactions use domains, phishing domains common ("uniswap.eth" vs "uniiswap.eth") [Analytics: ENS Usage, 2025]; (4) **Hardware wallet physical button** confirmation prevents software malware auto-signing but doesn't address blind signing (user presses button without understanding transaction) [Report: Hardware Wallet Security Model, 2024]. Key lessons: (a) Warnings and friction insufficient—users bypass when inconvenient; (b) Display limitations fundamental—cannot show all details on small screens; (c) Transaction simulation powerful but costly at scale—need subsidy or protocol-level support; (d) Clear signing requires ecosystem coordination—wallets alone cannot solve; (e) User education limited effectiveness—70-80% lack technical literacy; (f) Address verification UX critical—copying addresses high-risk behavior; (g) Standards adoption slow—fragmented ecosystem and competing proposals; (h) Sophisticated attackers adapt—social engineering bypasses technical controls
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**:
     - **Facts**: 60-75% of phishing attacks exploit blind signing [Analytics: Phishing Attack Vector Analysis, 2025]; $200-400M annual blind signing-related losses [Analysis: Blind Signing Loss Attribution, 2024]; 65-80% DeFi transactions involve blind signing [Survey: User Transaction Comprehension, 2024-Q3]; <30% transaction simulation adoption [Analytics: Transaction Simulation Effectiveness, 2024-Q4]; <15% DApp clear signing support [Report: Ledger Clear Signing Adoption, 2025]; 85-90% hardware wallet DApp interactions require enabling blind signing [Survey: Hardware Wallet User Behavior, 2024]; 60-70% users bypass high-risk warnings [Analytics: Warning Bypass Rates, 2025-Q1]; 30-40% users consistently verify addresses [Survey: Address Verification Behavior, 2024]; <20% address book adoption [Survey: Address Book Usage, 2024]; <5% ENS usage for transactions [Analytics: ENS Usage, 2025]; Hardware wallet screens 128×64 to 480×800 pixels [Specification: Hardware Wallet Displays, 2024]; $0.01-$0.05 transaction simulation cost [Pricing: Simulation Provider APIs, 2025]; 75-85% wallet interactions on mobile [Survey: Wallet User Device Preferences, 2024]
     - **Assumptions**: $200-400M annual blind signing losses (subset of $880M+ total phishing, estimated from incident reports attributing loss to transaction misunderstanding vs other phishing vectors [Analysis: Blind Signing Loss Attribution, 2024]); 100M+ wallet users (aggregated from wallet provider disclosures [Public: Wallet User Statistics, 2025]); 10M+ daily transactions (extrapolated from blockchain activity [Analytics: On-Chain Transaction Volume, 2025]); $100K-$500K/mo simulation infrastructure costs at scale (estimated from provider pricing and daily transaction volumes [Analysis: Simulation Infrastructure Economics, 2024]); $300K-$1M wallet transaction simulation implementation (estimated from development timelines and team costs [Survey: Wallet Development Costs, 2024]); $30K-$100K per DApp clear signing integration (estimated from development complexity [Survey: DApp Development Costs, 2024]); 40-50% MPC implementations vulnerable to blind signing (inferred from architecture reviews and vendor security analyses [Report: Hypernative MPC Blind Signing Gap, 2025]); 70-80% users lack technical literacy (inferred from user surveys and onboarding comprehension tests [Survey: User Technical Literacy, 2024])
     - **Uncertainties**: True blind signing attribution (difficult to isolate blind signing vs other attack vectors in incident reports, many unreported); Optimal transaction display level of detail (full contract source code vs high-level summary, balancing comprehension vs information overload); Transaction simulation accuracy rates (how often simulations wrong due to oracle data, network conditions, contract edge cases); User willingness to accept increased transaction friction for security (will requiring full review reduce wallet adoption); Economic sustainability of transaction simulation (who subsidizes at scale—wallets, DApps, protocols, users); Clear signing metadata standardization timeline (will EIP process converge on standard, how long for ecosystem adoption); Hardware wallet display technology evolution (e-ink, color screens, larger form factors, cost/benefit trade-offs); Liability framework for blind signing (are wallet providers negligent, or is user signature consent regardless of understanding); EIP-7702 phishing prevalence (new attack vector, scale unknown, will become widespread or remain niche); MPC wallet architecture evolution (will blind signing elimination become standard security requirement); Address verification tooling effectiveness (can better UX increase verification rates from 30-40% to >90%); AI-based phishing detection accuracy (can machine learning identify blind signing phishing patterns with <5% false positive rate); Account abstraction impact on signing model (will session keys and intent-based transactions reduce blind signing surface); Quantum-resistant signature schemes (will post-quantum cryptography change signing UX, display requirements)

## Glossary

- **Blind signing**: Signing blockchain transactions without seeing or understanding complete transaction details, often due to display limitations or complex encoded data
- **Clear signing**: Hardware wallet feature displaying human-readable transaction details (function name, parameters, expected outcomes) via DApp-provided structured metadata
- **Delegate call**: Smart contract instruction executing code in context of calling contract, allowing proxy patterns but enabling privilege escalation if misused
- **EIP-7702**: Ethereum Improvement Proposal allowing EOA temporary delegation to smart contract, enabling account abstraction but creating phishing risk
- **EOA (Externally Owned Account)**: Standard Ethereum account controlled by private key (vs contract account), user's primary wallet address type
- **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)**: Decentralized domain name system mapping human-readable names ("vitalik.eth") to blockchain addresses
- **Proxy contract**: Smart contract pattern with separate proxy (user-facing address) and implementation (logic contract) allowing upgrades but obscuring function calls
- **Transaction simulation**: Pre-signature execution of transaction in sandboxed environment to show expected balance changes, approvals, and state changes
- **Address poisoning**: Attack sending dust transactions from visually similar addresses (matching first/last characters) to trick users copying from history
- **Signature fatigue**: Reduced user attention and review rigor for transaction signatures due to frequent signing requests
