# Backend Server Infrastructure Operational Security Bypassing MPC Protection

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Infrastructure Security & Operations Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: Cryptocurrency exchanges and MPC wallet providers implementing cryptographically secure multi-party computation (MPC) for key management face critical operational infrastructure vulnerabilities where attackers bypass distributed cryptographic controls by compromising backend servers, internal access systems, and operational workflows, resulting in $71M losses in July 2025 alone (CoinDCX $44M server breach, BigONE $27M supply chain attack on hot wallet logic), demonstrating that cryptographic security provides no protection against operational infrastructure compromise affecting est. 500+ exchanges managing $500B+ assets. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets eliminate single points of failure in private key management through distributed cryptography, but security model assumes operational infrastructure (servers executing MPC protocols, access control systems, internal networks, employee workstations) remains secure—an assumption repeatedly violated in practice [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025]. July 2025 attacks demonstrated bypass vectors: (1) CoinDCX $44M loss via server breach compromising internal operational wallet (attackers gained backend server access, exfiltrated hot wallet credentials, withdrew funds without touching MPC-protected cold storage) [Source: Halborn, July 2025; Thedefiant.io, July 2025]; (2) BigONE $27M loss via supply chain attack manipulating hot wallet logic through third-party software (compromised third-party software component in hot wallet infrastructure, injected unauthorized withdrawal logic, bypassed MPC authorization controls) [Source: Guardrail.ai, July 2025; OKX, July 2025]. Root causes: inadequate server hardening (default configurations, unpatched vulnerabilities, excessive privileges), weak access controls (insufficient authentication, overly broad permissions, lack of privileged access management), supply chain risks (unvetted third-party software in critical infrastructure, compromised dependencies), insufficient monitoring (delayed breach detection, limited visibility into server-level activity), operational security gaps (employee workstation compromise, phishing-based credential theft). Industry impact: 65% of Q2 2024 crypto losses ($500M of $770M total) attributed to centralized exchange infrastructure compromises vs. on-chain vulnerabilities, indicating systemic shift in attack vectors [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025]. Resolution requires: comprehensive server hardening (principle of least privilege, regular patching, secure configurations), zero-trust access controls (strong authentication, microsegmentation, privileged access management), supply chain security (software bill of materials, vendor security assessments, third-party code audits), continuous monitoring (behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, real-time alerting), operational security training (phishing prevention, secure development practices, incident response).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Cryptocurrency custody architecture: MPC wallets use distributed key generation (DKG) and threshold signatures where key shares distributed across n parties (typical 3-of-5 or 2-of-3 configurations), t-of-n threshold required for signing, no single party holds complete private key [Source: AWS, 2024]. Cold storage (95%+ of assets): MPC-protected keys in air-gapped environments, manual multi-party approval for withdrawals, prioritizes security over availability [Source: Coinbase Developer Docs, 2024]. Hot wallets (3-5% of assets for operational liquidity): MPC or multi-sig protected but connected to internet, automated signing for customer withdrawals, balance between security and operational efficiency. Backend infrastructure: Application servers (executing MPC signing protocols, coordinating between parties, processing transaction requests), database servers (storing encrypted key shares, transaction logs, user balances), API gateways (processing withdrawal requests, external integrations), internal networks (connecting components, isolating from public internet), employee workstations (administrators accessing production systems), third-party dependencies (software libraries, monitoring tools, cloud services). Current security posture gaps: Server hardening often insufficient (default operating system configurations, delayed patch management, excessive services running, overly permissive firewall rules [inferred from general industry practices]); Access controls fragmented (username/password authentication common, insufficient MFA enforcement, shared credentials for administrative access, broad network access permissions [inferred from security incidents]); Supply chain largely unmanaged (third-party software integrated without security reviews, dependency vulnerabilities untracked, limited SBOM maintenance [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025]); Monitoring reactive (log analysis manual, limited behavioral baselines, slow incident detection averaging 5-72 hours [estimated from breach disclosures]); Operational security inconsistent (phishing training inadequate, development practices insecure, insider threat controls minimal [inferred from incident patterns]). July 2025 CoinDCX incident: "Server breach" compromised internal operational wallet, attackers exfiltrated credentials for hot wallet system, withdrew $44M, CEO disclosed incident publicly, user funds not affected (CoinDCX absorbed losses), investigation ongoing [Source: Halborn, July 2025; Theblock.co, July 2025; Ampcuscyber, July 2025]. July 2025 BigONE incident: Supply chain attack manipulated hot wallet logic, third-party software component compromised, injected unauthorized withdrawal functionality, bypassed MPC authorization checks, $27M stolen, incident linked to sophisticated attacker with infrastructure penetration capabilities [Source: Guardrail.ai, July 2025; OKX, July 2025; Coinmonks, July 2025]. Industry pattern: Blockaid analysis of Q2 2024 losses shows 65% of crypto theft ($500M of $770M) from centralized exchange infrastructure compromises (backend systems, access controls, operational procedures) vs. 35% on-chain vulnerabilities (smart contract exploits, bridge hacks), indicating attackers shifting to infrastructure targets as easier attack surface [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025]. Regulatory pressure: SEC average fine increased to $426M in 2024, blockchain companies facing disproportionate enforcement for operational security failures, SOC 2 Type II compliance increasingly mandatory for institutional custody, requiring comprehensive internal controls [Source: Compliancehub.wiki, 2025; Chainstack, 2024]. Expert consensus: "MPC alone can't stop multi-million dollar exchange hacks"—cryptographic security layer necessary but insufficient without operational infrastructure hardening [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Breach prevention: Reduce backend infrastructure compromises from est. 10-15 major incidents/year (2024-2025 baseline: CoinDCX, BigONE, WazirX, plus unreported incidents) → <3/year (min) / <1/year (target) / 0/year (ideal) by Q4 2026. Loss mitigation: Reduce infrastructure-related theft from est. $500M/year (65% of $770M Q2 2024 extrapolated annually) → <$100M/year (min) / <$50M/year (target) / <$10M/year (ideal) by Q4 2026. Server hardening coverage: Achieve 100% of production servers implementing hardened configurations (CIS Benchmarks level 1 minimum, automated configuration management, weekly vulnerability scanning, <7 day patch cycle for critical vulnerabilities) by Q2 2026 (current: est. <50% coverage based on incident patterns). Access control maturity: Implement zero-trust architecture for 100% of privileged access (MFA with hardware tokens mandatory, privileged access management PAM system, just-in-time JIT access, session recording, quarterly access reviews) by Q3 2026 (current: est. 30-50% implement basic MFA, <20% have PAM systems). Supply chain security: Establish comprehensive supply chain risk management for ≥95% of critical third-party software (vendor security assessments, SBOM maintenance, automated dependency scanning, regular third-party audits, contractual security requirements) by Q4 2026 (current: est. <30% have formal programs). Monitoring effectiveness: Deploy behavioral analytics and anomaly detection achieving <15 min (min) / <5 min (target) / <1 min (ideal) detection time for suspicious infrastructure access or configuration changes by Q3 2026 (current: 5-72 hours average detection). Operational security training: Achieve ≥95% employee completion of quarterly security awareness training (phishing simulations, secure coding practices, incident response procedures) with <5% phishing simulation click rate by Q2 2026 (current: training often annual, click rates >15%). SOC 2 compliance: Obtain SOC 2 Type II certification for 100% of custody providers serving institutional clients by Q4 2026 (current: est. 40-60% have SOC 2, many Type I only). Regulatory compliance: Zero operational security-related enforcement actions or fines related to infrastructure compromise by Q4 2026 (2024 baseline: SEC fines averaging $426M for blockchain companies, many related to operational failures).
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for comprehensive infrastructure overhaul: server hardening + access control upgrade + supply chain program + monitoring deployment + training + certification); Accelerated 12-month track possible for high-priority components (hardening + access controls by Q4 2026). Budget: $2M-$8M per major provider (server hardening $500K-$2M infrastructure assessment, configuration management tools, vulnerability management platform; Access controls $800K-$3M PAM system, MFA hardware tokens, identity governance, network microsegmentation; Supply chain $300K-$1M SBOM tooling, vendor assessments, third-party audits; Monitoring $400K-$1.5M SIEM platform, behavioral analytics, threat intelligence; Training $200K-$500K security awareness platform, phishing simulations, secure development training; SOC 2 certification $300K-$800K readiness assessment, controls implementation, audit fees); Total industry-wide $1B-$4B (500+ exchanges × $2M-$8M average). Team: Per provider requires 5-10 infrastructure security engineers (server hardening, vulnerability management, network security, incident response), 3-5 identity and access management IAM specialists (PAM deployment, MFA rollout, access governance), 2-3 supply chain security analysts (vendor assessments, SBOM maintenance, third-party audits), 3-5 security operations center SOC analysts (monitoring, threat hunting, incident triage), 2-3 compliance specialists (SOC 2 readiness, audit coordination, regulatory reporting), 1-2 security awareness trainers (phishing campaigns, developer training, incident exercises). Technology: Server hardening (CIS Benchmarks configuration baselines, automated configuration management tools Ansible/Chef/Puppet, vulnerability scanners Qualys/Tenable), Access controls (PAM systems CyberArk/BeyondTrust, MFA Okta/Duo with FIDO2 hardware keys, microsegmentation Illumio/Guardicore, identity governance SailPoint/Saviynt), Supply chain (SBOM generation tools SPDX/CycloneDX, dependency scanners Snyk/Sonatype, vendor assessment platforms OneTrust/Prevalent), Monitoring (SIEM platforms Splunk/Sentinel, behavioral analytics Exabeam/Securonix, threat intelligence feeds), Training (awareness platforms KnowBe4/Proofpoint, secure coding training Secure Code Warrior/Checkmarx), Compliance (GRC platforms ServiceNow/MetricStream, SOC 2 automation Vanta/Drata). Operational constraints: Cannot disrupt existing production systems (hardening must be phased, gradual rollout), legacy infrastructure difficult to secure (outdated operating systems, unsupported software requiring migration), employee productivity impact (stricter access controls add friction, training takes time away from development). Regulatory requirements: SOC 2 Type II mandatory for institutional custody (annual audits, continuous monitoring), MiCA requirements for EU custody providers (operational resilience, incident reporting), SEC custody rule proposals emphasizing operational controls (asset segregation, independent oversight).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     Cryptocurrency Exchanges (500+ globally including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, regional exchanges, need backend infrastructure security to protect customer assets and maintain regulatory compliance, constraint: $2M-$8M implementation cost per exchange + ongoing operational overhead); MPC Wallet Providers (50+ institutional custody providers Fireblocks, BitGo, Anchorage, Coinbase WaaS, need operational security complementing cryptographic security, constraint: customers assume MPC guarantees security, infrastructure hardening not differentiated in marketing); End Users - Individual (est. 500M cryptocurrency users globally, need confidence in exchange security for asset custody, constraint: lack visibility into backend infrastructure security, rely on brand reputation); End Users - Institutional (pension funds, family offices, hedge funds managing $50B+ in crypto custody, need SOC 2 attestations and operational security evidence for fiduciary compliance, constraint: cannot tolerate $1M+ losses from operational failures); Infrastructure Security Teams (5-10 engineers per provider, need tools and resources to implement hardening, constraint: understaffed relative to threat landscape, competing priorities, legacy infrastructure challenges); Chief Information Security Officers CISOs (responsible for overall security posture, need board-level support for infrastructure investments, constraint: budget limitations, difficulty quantifying ROI of preventative security); Compliance Officers (managing SOC 2 audits and regulatory reporting, need evidence of effective controls, constraint: audit requirements evolving, documentation burden, continuous monitoring needed); Cloud Service Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure hosting exchange infrastructure, provide security tools but shared responsibility model, constraint: cannot prevent customer misconfigurations, overly permissive access policies); Auditors (Big Four firms and specialized crypto auditors conducting SOC 2 examinations, need comprehensive control documentation and testing evidence, constraint: limited crypto-specific audit expertise, SOC 2 scoping challenges for complex infrastructures); Regulators (SEC, MiCA authorities, requiring operational security standards for custody providers, constraint: struggle to keep pace with technology evolution, enforcement reactive after major incidents); Insurance Providers (cyber insurance and custody insurance underwriters, need risk assessments to price policies, constraint: limited actuarial data on infrastructure compromise losses, many incidents unreported); Victims of Infrastructure Attacks (CoinDCX users, BigONE users affected by July 2025 incidents, need asset recovery and transparency, constraint: many exchanges do not fully compensate users, disclosure limited); Security Researchers (analyzing infrastructure vulnerabilities, need coordinated disclosure channels, constraint: exchange bug bounty programs often limited to web application vulnerabilities, infrastructure out of scope); Law Enforcement (investigating infrastructure breaches, need forensic cooperation from exchanges, constraint: cross-jurisdictional challenges, cryptocurrency attribution complexity, many exchanges uncooperative).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for comprehensive infrastructure security program: assessment + hardening + access controls + supply chain + monitoring + training + certification); High-priority accelerated track Q1-Q4 2026 (12 months: hardening + access controls addressing most critical gaps). Systems: Backend application servers (executing MPC protocols, processing transactions, coordinating signing ceremonies, API endpoints), database servers (PostgreSQL/MySQL storing encrypted key shares, user data, transaction logs), hot wallet infrastructure (automated signing systems, balance management, withdrawal processing, MPC client applications), internal networks (VLANs, firewalls, microsegmentation, network access controls), employee workstations (Windows/macOS/Linux endpoints, administrator access, development environments), third-party software (monitoring agents, logging systems, backup solutions, communication tools, cloud services), infrastructure-as-code IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation managing cloud resources), CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitLab CI deploying code, potential supply chain injection point), cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure compute, storage, networking), API gateways (processing customer requests, rate limiting, authentication), load balancers (distributing traffic, potential single points of failure), DNS and CDN (domain resolution, DDoS protection, potential hijacking vectors). Current vulnerability state: CIS Benchmark compliance likely <50% of servers (based on typical enterprise baselines and incident patterns), privileged access management adoption <20% of providers, supply chain security formal programs <30%, SOC 2 Type II certification 40-60% of institutional custody providers, behavioral monitoring advanced analytics deployment <40%, phishing simulation click rates >15% indicating training gaps. Scale: 500+ cryptocurrency exchanges globally, 50+ MPC custody providers, 500M+ users with cryptocurrency holdings, $3T total crypto market capitalization, $500B+ assets under custody management, $770M quarterly theft (Q2 2024), 65% ($500M) from infrastructure compromises. Financial impact: July 2025 incidents: CoinDCX $44M + BigONE $27M = $71M in single month from infrastructure attacks; Extrapolated annual losses: $500M-$1B from backend infrastructure compromises if trend continues; Industry-wide implementation costs: $1B-$4B one-time (500 exchanges × $2M-$8M) + $200M-$800M annual (ongoing monitoring, training, audits); Regulatory risk: SEC fines averaging $426M in 2024 for blockchain companies, many related to custody operational failures; Insurance: Cyber insurance premiums increasing 20-30% annually, coverage excluding infrastructure compromise in some policies. Geographic scope: Global (cryptocurrency exchanges operate internationally, infrastructure hosted in multiple regions, cross-border regulatory complexity). Threat actors: Nation-state APT groups (targeting exchanges as high-value targets, sophisticated infrastructure penetration capabilities), organized cybercrime (financially motivated, exploit weak operational security), supply chain attackers (compromise third-party software affecting multiple downstream targets), insider threats (employees with excessive privileges, compromised credentials). Historical incidents: July 2025 CoinDCX $44M server breach, July 2025 BigONE $27M supply chain attack, February 2025 Bybit $1.5B (UI manipulation but also infrastructure compromise elements), July 2024 WazirX $230M (multisig compromise but operational security gaps), 2022 Ronin Bridge $600M (validator infrastructure compromise), 2019 QuadrigaCX $190M (operational security failure, CEO sole access to cold storage keys). Industry trend: Attackers shifting from on-chain exploits (smart contract vulnerabilities, 35% of losses) to off-chain infrastructure attacks (backend servers, access controls, 65% of losses in Q2 2024), driven by improved smart contract security practices making infrastructure relatively easier target [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025].
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2010-2018 early exchange era: Limited operational security focus (Mt. Gox 2014 $450M loss highlighted custody risks, but infrastructure security immature, primarily focused on "cold storage" concept without comprehensive operational controls); Lessons: Cold storage alone insufficient, hot wallet operational security critical, but specific hardening practices underdeveloped. 2019-2021 institutional custody emergence: Coinbase Custody, BitGo, Anchorage pioneered SOC 2 compliance for crypto custody (first SOC 2 reports published 2019-2020, establishing internal control baselines), implemented basic access controls (MFA adoption, role-based access control), server hardening using cloud provider security tools (AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center), but gaps remained (privileged access management limited, supply chain security nascent, monitoring reactive) [Source: Coinbase Developer Docs, Chainstack SOC 2, 2024]. 2022-2023 growing infrastructure attacks: Ronin Bridge March 2022 $600M (validator infrastructure compromised via phishing, inadequate access controls, highlighted operational security weaknesses), industry response: increased MFA adoption (hardware tokens like YubiKey becoming standard), privileged access management (CyberArk, BeyondTrust deployments accelerating), network microsegmentation (Illumio, Guardicore isolating production environments), but implementation incomplete across industry (estimated <20% exchanges have comprehensive PAM by 2023). 2024 infrastructure focus intensifies: AWS published MPC wallet architecture using Nitro Enclaves (trusted execution environments for key shares, hardware-based isolation, reproducible builds and attestation for supply chain security), providing reference architecture for operational security [Source: AWS, 2024]; Halborn published case study on infrastructure hardening for B2B custody provider (comprehensive penetration testing, configuration reviews, security architecture redesign), demonstrating methodology [Source: Halborn case study, 2024]; SOC 2 Type II adoption increased to est. 40-60% of institutional custody providers (annual audits, continuous monitoring, but controls vary in maturity). July 2025 wake-up call: CoinDCX $44M and BigONE $27M incidents in same month demonstrated MPC cryptographic security insufficient, backend infrastructure remains critical vulnerability, Blockaid analysis showing 65% of Q2 2024 losses from infrastructure vs. on-chain [Source: Thedefiant.io, Halborn, Guardrail.ai, 2025]; Industry response: Emergency security reviews (many exchanges conducting rapid infrastructure audits, engaging external consultants), access control tightening (accelerated PAM deployments, stricter MFA enforcement), supply chain initiatives (SBOM generation increasing, third-party software reviews), but comprehensive solutions take 12-24 months to implement. Current best practices emerging: Zero-trust architecture (verify every access request, microsegmentation, least privilege), hardware security modules HSMs for hot wallet key protection (FIPS 140-2 Level 3, Thales, Utimaco), trusted execution environments TEEs like AWS Nitro Enclaves (hardware isolation for MPC signing), continuous monitoring (SIEM with behavioral analytics, 24/7 SOC, threat intelligence integration), supply chain security programs (SBOM, vendor assessments, third-party audits, contractual security requirements), SOC 2 Type II certification (annual audits, comprehensive controls, transparency for institutional clients), regular penetration testing (quarterly external tests, annual red team exercises, infrastructure focus not just web applications). Key lessons from July 2025 incidents: (1) Cryptographic security (MPC, multi-sig) necessary but not sufficient; (2) Backend infrastructure hardening equal priority to key management; (3) Supply chain attacks increasing, third-party software requires security review; (4) Access controls must be zero-trust (assume breach, verify all access, limit lateral movement); (5) Monitoring must be real-time (5-72 hour detection lag enables attackers to complete theft); (6) SOC 2 compliance increasingly regulatory expectation for custody providers; (7) Industry coordination needed (attackers target multiple exchanges, shared intelligence critical).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: CoinDCX $44M loss July 2025 via "server breach" compromising internal operational wallet [Source: Halborn, July 2025; Theblock.co, July 2025; Ampcuscyber, July 2025]; BigONE $27M loss July 2025 via supply chain attack manipulating hot wallet logic through third-party software [Source: Guardrail.ai, July 2025; OKX, July 2025; Coinmonks, July 2025]; Blockaid analysis: 65% of Q2 2024 crypto losses ($500M of $770M) from centralized exchange infrastructure compromises vs. 35% on-chain vulnerabilities [Source: Thedefiant.io, July 2025]; SEC average fine $426M in 2024 for blockchain companies, disproportionate enforcement [Source: Compliancehub.wiki, 2025]; SOC 2 compliance increasingly mandatory for institutional custody [Source: Chainstack, 2024]; AWS published MPC wallet architecture using Nitro Enclaves for operational security [Source: AWS, 2024]; Typical custody architecture: 95%+ cold storage, 3-5% hot wallets [industry standard].
     - **Assumptions**: 500+ cryptocurrency exchanges globally (major exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, plus hundreds of regional/smaller exchanges); 50+ MPC custody providers (institutional focus: Fireblocks, BitGo, Anchorage, Coinbase WaaS, plus emerging providers); 500M cryptocurrency users globally (extrapolated from exchange registrations and wallet addresses); $500B+ assets under custody management (Coinbase institutional custody $130B as benchmark, extrapolated); $500M-$1B annual losses from infrastructure attacks (65% of Q2 2024 $770M extrapolated, $500M-$1B range accounting for seasonal variation and unreported incidents); Implementation costs $2M-$8M per provider (hardening $500K-$2M, access controls $800K-$3M, supply chain $300K-$1M, monitoring $400K-$1.5M, training $200K-$500K, SOC 2 $300K-$800K); <50% servers CIS Benchmark compliant (inferred from incident patterns indicating inadequate hardening); <20% providers have PAM systems (emerging technology, expensive, complex deployment); <30% have formal supply chain programs (recent focus area, immature practices); 40-60% SOC 2 Type II certified (institutional providers prioritize, smaller exchanges lack); Detection lag 5-72 hours average (based on breach disclosure timelines, time from compromise to detection); Phishing click rates >15% (typical enterprise baseline before intensive training); 10-15 major infrastructure compromise incidents/year 2024-2025 (CoinDCX, BigONE, WazirX, plus unreported incidents estimated from loss volumes).
     - **Uncertainties**: How many infrastructure attacks go unreported? (Exchanges reluctant to disclose, user losses quietly absorbed, true incident count unknown); What percentage of losses actually from infrastructure vs. other vectors? (Blockaid 65% based on Q2 2024 sample, may vary by quarter, attribution difficult); Will SOC 2 Type II become regulatory requirement? (Increasingly expected by institutional clients and regulators, but not yet universal mandate); What is optimal balance between security and operational efficiency? (Stricter access controls add friction, may slow legitimate operations, risk tolerance varies by exchange); Can zero-trust architecture be retrofitted to legacy infrastructure? (Many exchanges run on legacy systems, difficult to microsegment, may require infrastructure replacement); How effective are current PAM systems against sophisticated attackers? (Provide strong controls but not perfect, determined attacker with insider access may circumvent); What is acceptable detection latency? (5-72 hours current, aspiring to <15 minutes, but is real-time monitoring operationally feasible for all providers?); Will supply chain attacks increase or plateau? (BigONE incident suggests growing vector, but may also drive defensive improvements reducing success rate); What is long-term sustainability of operational security investment? ($2M-$8M one-time + ongoing costs, can smaller exchanges afford? Consolidation pressure?); How will quantum computing affect operational security requirements? (Post-quantum cryptography transition may require infrastructure upgrades, timeline uncertain 5-10 years); What role will AI/ML play in threat detection? (Behavioral analytics promising but requires large datasets, false positive rates, integration challenges); Will regulatory enforcement increase pressure? (SEC $426M average fines suggest yes, but cryptocurrency-specific custody rules still evolving).

## Glossary

- **Backend Infrastructure**: Servers, networks, databases, and systems executing MPC protocols and processing transactions, distinct from cryptographic key management layer; vulnerabilities enable attackers to bypass distributed key security.
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Center for Internet Security configuration hardening standards providing secure baseline settings for operating systems, databases, and applications; Level 1 focuses on basic security, Level 2 on defense-in-depth.
- **Hot Wallet**: Internet-connected cryptocurrency wallet holding 3-5% of exchange assets for operational liquidity (customer withdrawals, trading), automated signing for efficiency, balanced security-availability trade-off, contrasts with cold storage 95%+ assets.
- **Microsegmentation**: Network security technique isolating workloads into separate segments with granular firewall policies, limiting lateral movement if one segment compromised, zero-trust architecture component.
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Security solution managing and monitoring privileged accounts (administrators, root users), providing just-in-time access, session recording, credential vaulting, reduces insider threat and compromised credential risk.
- **Server Hardening**: Process of securing server by reducing attack surface: removing unnecessary services, applying security patches, implementing least privilege, configuring secure settings per CIS Benchmarks or similar standards.
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service Organization Control 2 report attesting to effectiveness of security controls over minimum 6-month period (Type I audits design at point in time), required by institutional custody clients for operational security assurance.
