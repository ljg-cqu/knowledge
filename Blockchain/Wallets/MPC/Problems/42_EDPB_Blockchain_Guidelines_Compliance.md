## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallet providers face new EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 on blockchain data processing requiring fundamental architecture changes (no on-chain personal data, off-chain storage, preference for private/permissioned blockchains, mandatory DPIAs, immutability conflict with right to erasure) by Q3 2025, affecting 50+ MPC providers serving 200M+ users, with non-compliance risking EU GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% global turnover, license revocation in EU member states ($100M+ annual revenue loss per major provider), and technical debt from retroactive architecture changes ($5M-$15M per provider for existing deployments). Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 (published April 2025, public consultation closed June 2025) establish comprehensive data protection requirements for blockchain technologies, creating compliance crisis for MPC wallet providers who store key shares, transaction metadata, and user identifiers on-chain [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]. Critical requirements: (1) No personal data on-chain (blockchain should only reference off-chain data, encrypted/hashed data remains personal data subject to GDPR) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; (2) Preference for private/permissioned blockchains (public blockchains create global accessibility risks, clear role assignment needed for controller/processor determination) [Guide: activeMind.legal, 2025]; (3) Mandatory DPIA for blockchain processing (immutability, international transfers, data subject rights enforcement risks) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; (4) Immutability conflicts with right to erasure (technical impossibility not acceptable justification, consent-based processing requires deletion capability) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; (5) Smart contracts must comply with Art. 22 GDPR (automated decisions require human intervention, transparency) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]. Current MPC architecture violations: Most providers store encrypted key shares directly on-chain (Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase WaaS use public blockchain or consortium chains for share coordination), transaction history includes wallet addresses linked to users (persistent identifiers constituting personal data), share refresh operations recorded on-chain (audit trail contains user linkage), smart contracts execute automated threshold validations (no human intervention for Art. 22 compliance), DPIAs not conducted specifically for blockchain components [Web Search: MPC deployment challenges, 2025]. Estimated 40-60% of current MPC deployments non-compliant if Guidelines strictly enforced, requiring $5M-$15M per major provider for architecture redesign (off-chain storage layers, private blockchain migration, DPIA execution, consent management, deletion mechanisms).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     EDPB issued Guidelines 02/2025 on processing of personal data through blockchain technologies on April 14, 2025, with public consultation closing June 9, 2025 [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]. Guidelines address fundamental tension: blockchain's defining characteristics (decentralization, immutability, transparency) conflict with GDPR principles (purpose limitation, storage limitation, right to erasure, data minimization) [Guide: activeMind.legal, 2025]. Core EDPB positions: (1) Blockchain data protection = privacy by design (Art. 25 GDPR mandatory from outset, not retrofit); (2) Personal data definition includes pseudonymous identifiers (wallet addresses, transaction hashes if linked to natural person); (3) Encrypted data remains personal (encryption/hashing with secret salt still subject to GDPR unless truly anonymized); (4) Immutability problematic (right to erasure Art. 17, rectification Art. 16 difficult to implement, technical impossibility not valid excuse); (5) Public blockchains high-risk (global accessibility creates uncontrolled third-country transfers, unclear controller/processor roles, recommend private/permissioned alternatives); (6) Smart contracts = automated decisions (Art. 22 GDPR applies if legal effects or significant impact on data subjects, human intervention required) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]. MPC wallet current architecture: Threshold signature schemes (TSS) distribute key shares across n parties requiring k signatures (typical 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 configurations) [Guide: Stackup, 2024]. Share storage predominantly on-chain or consortium blockchain: Fireblocks uses secure MPC nodes with share coordination via proprietary protocol (shares in HSMs + cloud, coordination metadata potentially on-chain), BitGo stores shares across customer device + BitGo servers + optional cold storage (share refresh operations logged for audit), Coinbase WaaS uses distributed key generation with shares in user environment + Coinbase infrastructure (transaction approval metadata recorded) [Web Search: MPC implementation, 2024]. Personal data in MPC systems: (1) Wallet addresses (pseudonymous identifiers linked to users through KYC, transaction history, IP addresses); (2) Transaction metadata (timestamps, amounts, counterparties potentially revealing patterns); (3) Key share refresh logs (audit trails showing which users participated, when, from where); (4) Smart contract interactions (DeFi approvals, NFT transfers, governance votes linked to identity); (5) Off-chain signatures (message signing for authentication, proof of ownership) [Web Search: MPC privacy risks, 2024]. EDPB Guidelines threat: Strict interpretation requires fundamental redesign (all personal data off-chain, blockchain only for cryptographic commitments or references), migration of existing deployments (re-architecting production systems with hundreds of thousands of active wallets, $5M-$15M per major provider estimated from infrastructure redesign + data migration + testing + compliance validation), competition disadvantage (early adopters of compliant architecture vs. laggards risking enforcement), regulatory uncertainty (Guidelines in consultation phase, final version may differ, enforcement timeline unclear but likely Q3-Q4 2025 based on GDPR precedent) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Regulatory compliance: Achieve 100% compliance with EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 final version by Q4 2025 (6 months from assumed Q2 2025 publication, based on typical GDPR guidance implementation timeline), verified through legal audit demonstrating: (1) Zero personal data stored on-chain (wallet addresses, transaction metadata, user linkages moved off-chain or effectively anonymized); (2) DPIA completed for all blockchain components (immutability risks, third-country transfers, data subject rights enforcement documented); (3) Private/permissioned blockchain used or public blockchain justified with exceptional safeguards; (4) Smart contracts comply with Art. 22 GDPR (human intervention mechanisms, transparency, contestability); (5) Right to erasure implementable (deletion or irreversible anonymization within 30 days of request per Art. 17). Architecture migration: Complete transition for existing deployments → ≥95% of active wallets migrated to compliant architecture by Q4 2025 (critical deadline before enforcement actions escalate), measured by: share storage in off-chain encrypted databases vs. on-chain (target: 100% off-chain for personal data, only cryptographic commitments on-chain); transaction history queryable from off-chain systems (target: <500ms latency vs. current on-chain retrieval); key refresh operations logged off-chain (target: audit-compliant without on-chain personal data exposure). Security preservation: Maintain MPC security guarantees during compliance transition → zero security degradation measured by: threshold security properties unchanged (k-of-n still required, no key reconstruction risk); key share distribution integrity (geographic diversity preserved despite off-chain storage); disaster recovery capability maintained (RPO <1h, RTO <4h despite architecture changes). Cost management: Control compliance expenditure → total cost $5M-$15M per major provider (legal analysis $500K-$1M for GDPR/EDPB expertise, architecture redesign $2M-$8M for off-chain storage layer + private blockchain evaluation + smart contract modifications, data migration $1M-$3M for transferring existing on-chain data to compliant off-chain systems, DPIA execution $200K-$500K for comprehensive blockchain risk assessment, ongoing operational overhead $300K-$800K/year for maintaining dual storage + compliance monitoring). User impact: Minimize disruption during migration → <0.1% wallet access failures, <5% user-facing latency increase, zero fund loss from migration errors.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q2 2025 - Q4 2025 (6 months: legal analysis and compliance gap assessment 2 months, architecture design and prototyping 2 months, production migration execution 3 months, post-migration validation and certification 1 month; assumes EDPB Guidelines finalized Q2 2025, enforcement actions beginning Q4 2025 based on GDPR enforcement patterns); Budget: $5M-$15M per major provider (legal consultations $500K-$1M for EDPB Guidelines interpretation + DPIA methodology + controller/processor determination, off-chain storage infrastructure $2M-$8M for encrypted databases + access control + disaster recovery + geographic distribution, blockchain evaluation $300K-$800K for private/permissioned alternatives vs. public blockchain justification, smart contract modifications $500K-$1.5M for Art. 22 compliance + transparency mechanisms, data migration tooling $1M-$3M for transferring historical on-chain data to off-chain systems without key reconstruction, testing and validation $500K-$1M for security audits + compliance verification + disaster recovery drills, ongoing operational increase $300K-$800K/year for maintaining off-chain infrastructure + compliance monitoring); Team: Requires 2-3 GDPR/EDPB specialists (interpreting Guidelines 02/2025, conducting DPIAs, determining controller/processor roles in multi-party MPC context), 1-2 data protection officers (required by Art. 37 GDPR for systematic processing, coordinating compliance program), 5-8 blockchain engineers (redesigning architecture for off-chain personal data storage, evaluating private/permissioned blockchains, implementing cryptographic commitments vs. raw data), 3-5 backend engineers (building off-chain storage layer, integrating with existing MPC signing protocols, ensuring <500ms query latency), 2-3 smart contract developers (modifying automated threshold validation for Art. 22 compliance, adding human intervention hooks, transparency mechanisms), 2-3 DevOps engineers (migrating production data, coordinating multi-region deployments, disaster recovery testing), 3-5 QA/security testers (validating no key reconstruction risk during migration, penetration testing off-chain storage, compliance verification); Technology constraints: Cannot weaken MPC security model (threshold properties must remain intact, no centralization of key material during off-chain migration), must preserve auditability (regulatory requirements for transaction history, but without on-chain personal data linkage), geographic distribution for disaster recovery (off-chain storage needs multi-region redundancy comparable to blockchain immutability), smart contract limitations (public blockchains cannot be easily modified for Art. 22 compliance, may require Layer 2 solutions or migration to private chains), legacy compatibility (existing user wallets deployed with on-chain architecture cannot be instantly upgraded, phased migration required); Regulatory uncertainty: Guidelines in final review (public consultation feedback may alter requirements, cannot finalize implementation until official publication), enforcement discretion (will EU DPAs strictly enforce? grace period duration unknown), extraterritorial application (do Guidelines apply to non-EU providers serving EU users? Schrems II precedent suggests yes but case law pending).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     MPC Wallet Providers (50+ companies: Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase WaaS, ZenGo, Web3Auth, Turnkey, Portal, Magic, Lit Protocol, Qredo, Binance Custody, others operating in EU or serving EU users, need compliance to avoid GDPR fines €20M or 4% turnover + license revocation in EU member states, constraint: $5M-$15M compliance cost per provider, 6-month timeline, technical complexity of migrating production systems without key loss); EU Users (50M+ crypto users subject to GDPR, benefit from enhanced privacy protections, right to erasure implementation, constraint: potential service disruption during provider migration, some providers may geo-block EU users rather than comply increasing barrier to financial services access); Institutional Clients (hedge funds, family offices, exchanges with $10M-$1B+ digital asset custody using MPC wallets, need providers to demonstrate EDPB Guidelines compliance for regulatory audits, constraint: migration coordination burden, potential downtime windows for architecture changes, concern about security degradation from off-chain storage); EU Data Protection Authorities (27 member state DPAs responsible for GDPR enforcement including EDPB Guidelines, need clear controller/processor determinations in MPC multi-party context, constraint: limited blockchain technical expertise, novel enforcement scenario setting precedent for Web3 industry); EDPB Secretariat (issued Guidelines 02/2025, finalizing after public consultation, need practical implementability balanced with data protection principles, constraint: feedback from 60+ respondents during consultation including industry associations arguing for blockchain-specific accommodations); Blockchain Developers (100+ developers building MPC wallet infrastructure, need technical guidance on compliant architecture, constraint: privacy by design conflicts with blockchain transparency, cryptographic innovations required for off-chain verification); Smart Contract Auditors (20+ firms like Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin auditing MPC smart contracts, need to verify Art. 22 GDPR compliance in automated threshold signature validation, constraint: legal interpretation of "significant effect" triggering Art. 22 unclear in crypto context); Legal Compliance Consultants (50+ law firms advising crypto companies on GDPR, need to interpret EDPB Guidelines application to novel MPC architecture, constraint: case law absent, regulatory guidance evolving, cross-border complexity with different DPA interpretations).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q2 2025 - Q4 2025 (6 months: legal analysis 2 months including EDPB Guidelines interpretation + DPIA methodology + data mapping of on-chain personal data; architecture design 2 months including off-chain storage layer design + private blockchain evaluation + smart contract modification planning; migration execution 3 months including pilot customers + production rollout in waves + post-migration validation; compliance certification 1 month including legal audits + DPA consultations if seeking approval + insurance underwriting for GDPR compliance coverage); Systems affected: Key share storage architecture (moving from on-chain/consortium blockchain to off-chain encrypted databases with geographic distribution, blockchain retains only cryptographic commitments or references), transaction history indexing (off-chain databases for wallet addresses + transaction metadata + user linkages, on-chain only anonymous transaction records), key refresh protocols (audit logs moved off-chain while maintaining cryptographic proof of proper execution on-chain), smart contracts (adding human intervention mechanisms for Art. 22 compliance, transparency layers for automated decisions), user consent management (implementing granular consent for blockchain processing vs. off-chain processing, withdrawal triggering deletion obligations), DPIA frameworks (blockchain-specific risk assessment methodology, immutability vs. right to erasure analysis, third-country transfer evaluation for public blockchains), disaster recovery (off-chain storage redundancy comparable to blockchain immutability, tested recovery procedures without key reconstruction); Current state: Estimated 40-60% of MPC deployments non-compliant if EDPB Guidelines strictly enforced (personal data on-chain without off-chain alternative, DPIAs not conducted for blockchain components, smart contracts lack Art. 22 safeguards, right to erasure not implementable given immutability), most providers using public or consortium blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, proprietary consortium chains for share coordination), transaction metadata often on-chain (wallet addresses, timestamps, amounts creating linkability to users via KYC/IP/transaction patterns), no systematic approach to privacy by design in blockchain components (architecture designed for security/performance/decentralization optimizing against privacy requirements), expected enforcement beginning Q4 2025 based on GDPR precedent (6-12 months after Guidelines publication, initial warnings then fines escalating for continued non-compliance); Scale: 50+ MPC wallet providers globally, 200M+ users (50M in EU subject to GDPR + extraterritorial application to non-EU users' data processed by EU-established controllers), $500B+ assets under custody (Coinbase Institutional $130B+, BitGo $64B+, Fireblocks $200B+ transacted annually, others), potential fines €20M or 4% global turnover per violation (major providers with €100M-€1B+ revenue facing €4M-€40M+ fines if non-compliant), license revocation risk (MiFID, AMLD5 licenses in EU require GDPR compliance, loss blocking €50B+ institutional market access), competitive impact (first movers to compliance gain regulatory approval + institutional trust, laggards face enforcement + reputation damage).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2016-2018: EU GDPR enacted (2016, enforced May 2018) with Art. 17 right to erasure conflicting with blockchain immutability [Regulation: EU GDPR, 2016]. Early blockchain projects (Bitcoin, Ethereum) operated without GDPR consideration (pseudonymity assumed sufficient, no concept of controllers/processors in decentralized networks). Result: Growing legal uncertainty, academic papers warning of GDPR-blockchain incompatibility. Key lesson: Blockchain community initially dismissed GDPR applicability, assumed decentralization exempts from controller obligations, but regulators disagree. 2019-2021: Various DPAs issued guidance on blockchain (France CNIL 2018 sandbox report, European Blockchain Observatory 2018 report, UK ICO 2020 guidance on blockchain and GDPR), recommending: (1) Store personal data off-chain; (2) Use private/permissioned blockchains; (3) Encryption insufficient (remains personal data); (4) Determine controller/processor roles clearly [Web Search: blockchain GDPR guidance, 2021]. MPC wallet providers (Fireblocks launched 2019, Coinbase WaaS 2021) implemented some measures: private consortium blockchains for some enterprise clients (BitGo, Fireblocks offer private deployments), encryption of on-chain data (share fragments encrypted before blockchain storage), off-chain transaction history (some providers maintain parallel databases for fast queries), but fundamental architecture remained on-chain for share coordination and audit trail. Key lesson: Partial compliance insufficient; encrypted data still personal per GDPR recital 26; private blockchains mitigate but don't eliminate GDPR obligations. 2022-2024: GDPR enforcement increased (€1.6B fines in 2023), but blockchain-specific cases limited (few precedents for blockchain controller/processor determinations, DPAs focused on traditional violations like consent/data breaches) [EU DPA enforcement statistics, 2023]. MPC providers conducted ad-hoc compliance reviews (legal memos on controller status, user consent flows for wallet creation, data retention policies), but comprehensive DPIAs for blockchain components rare, architecture redesign avoided due to cost/complexity. Result: Compliance debt accumulating, providers awaiting clear regulatory guidance before major investments. 2025: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 published April 2025, consolidating fragmented DPA guidance into comprehensive framework, raising bar significantly [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]. Industry response: Public consultation feedback (60+ submissions) argued for blockchain-specific accommodations (immutability necessity for security, pseudonymity adequate for public blockchains, controller/processor roles unclear in decentralized multi-party systems), but EDPB unlikely to grant blanket exemptions based on GDPR enforcement history. Current state: Major providers evaluating compliance gaps ($5M-$15M budgets allocated), some exploring private blockchain migration (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda for enterprise MPC), others designing off-chain storage layers (encrypted databases with blockchain commitments), but production deployment timelines tight (Q4 2025 target for compliance given expected enforcement).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 published April 14, 2025, public consultation closed June 9, 2025 [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; Guidelines require: (1) No personal data on-chain (prefer off-chain storage), (2) Privacy by design (Art. 25 GDPR mandatory), (3) DPIAs for blockchain processing (high risk due to immutability), (4) Private/permissioned blockchains preferred (public blockchains create global accessibility risks), (5) Smart contracts comply Art. 22 GDPR (human intervention for automated decisions) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; Encrypted/hashed data remains personal if linked to natural person [Guide: activeMind.legal, 2025]; Technical impossibility not valid excuse for GDPR non-compliance (controller responsible for designing compliant technical means) [Regulation: EDPB Guidelines 02/2025, 2025]; GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% global turnover (Art. 83) [Regulation: EU GDPR, 2016]; Wallet addresses constitute pseudonymous identifiers (personal data per GDPR recital 26 if linkable to user via KYC, IP, transaction patterns); MPC wallet providers predominantly use public blockchains or consortium chains for share coordination (Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase WaaS architectures documented in public materials) [Web Search: MPC implementation, 2024]; GDPR enforcement increasing (€1.6B fines in 2023, trend upward) [EU DPA enforcement statistics, 2023].
     - **Assumptions**: 50+ MPC wallet providers globally (Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase, ZenGo, Web3Auth, Turnkey, Portal, Magic, Lit Protocol, Qredo, Binance, others estimated from market landscape); 200M+ users worldwide with 50M in EU (extrapolated from Coinbase 108M users × ~50% EU + other providers); $500B+ assets under custody (Coinbase $130B+, BitGo $64B+, Fireblocks $200B+ annual transaction volume, other providers estimated); 40-60% of current deployments non-compliant if EDPB Guidelines strictly enforced (personal data on-chain, no DPIAs, smart contracts lack Art. 22 safeguards, estimated from architecture reviews); $5M-$15M per major provider for compliance (legal $500K-$1M, infrastructure $2M-$8M, migration $1M-$3M, DPIA $200K-$500K, ongoing +$300K-$800K/year, estimated from enterprise compliance projects and infrastructure costs); Q4 2025 enforcement timeline (6 months from Guidelines publication Q2 2025, based on GDPR enforcement precedent where grace periods 6-12 months before fines escalate); EDPB Guidelines final version substantially similar to April 2025 draft (public consultation may result in clarifications but unlikely major relaxations given GDPR precedent of strict interpretation).
     - **Uncertainties**: Will EDPB Guidelines final version significantly differ from April 2025 draft? (Public consultation feedback may alter requirements, 60+ submissions including industry pushback, but GDPR history suggests limited accommodations); What is enforcement timeline? (Q4 2025 estimated but DPAs have discretion, may allow grace period or issue warnings before fines); How will DPAs interpret "personal data on-chain"? (Are cryptographic commitments acceptable? Hashed wallet addresses? Zero-knowledge proofs? Guidelines provide principles but case-by-case assessment needed); Can public blockchains ever be GDPR-compliant for MPC wallets? (Guidelines prefer private/permissioned but don't absolutely prohibit public if exceptional justification + safeguards, threshold unclear); What constitutes "human intervention" for Art. 22 compliance in threshold signatures? (Smart contract automatically validates k-of-n signatures - is this automated decision with significant effect? Legal interpretation uncertain); Will encrypted key shares stored on-chain be considered personal data? (Mathematically useless without threshold but linked to user wallet, Guidelines suggest yes but ambiguity remains); What is acceptable migration timeline for existing deployments? (Immediate compliance impossible for production systems with hundreds of thousands of wallets, but will DPAs grant 12-24 months? Unknown); How to implement right to erasure given blockchain immutability? (Deletion of off-chain data sufficient? Or must on-chain cryptographic commitments be "forgotten"? Guidelines say deletion/irreversible anonymization required but technical feasibility debated); Will private blockchain migration preserve MPC security guarantees? (Hyperledger Fabric, Corda offer privacy but different trust models than public blockchains, security implications unclear); What is cost-benefit of compliance vs. geo-blocking EU? (Some providers may exit EU market rather than spend $5M-$15M, but forfeit €50B+ addressable market); How will multi-party MPC controller/processor roles be determined? (User + wallet provider + optional escrow = joint controllers? Or provider = controller, user = data subject? Guidelines provide framework but practical application uncertain).

## Glossary

- **Art. 22 GDPR**: Prohibition on solely automated decision-making producing legal effects or significantly affecting data subjects; requires human intervention, transparency, right to contest. Relevant for MPC smart contracts executing automated threshold signature validations.
- **Art. 25 GDPR**: Privacy by design and by default requirements; controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure GDPR compliance from system design stage, not as retrofit.
- **Controller**: Entity determining purposes and means of personal data processing; liable for GDPR compliance including data subject rights, security, DPIAs. In MPC context, may be wallet provider, user, or joint controllers depending on architecture.
- **DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)**: Art. 35 GDPR requirement for high-risk processing; must identify risks to data subjects, evaluate necessity and proportionality, document safeguards. Mandatory for blockchain processing per EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 due to immutability, third-country transfers, data subject rights challenges.
- **EDPB (European Data Protection Board)**: Independent EU body ensuring consistent GDPR application across member states; issues guidelines, recommendations, binding decisions. Guidelines 02/2025 on blockchain technologies establish comprehensive data protection requirements.
- **Immutability**: Blockchain characteristic where recorded data cannot be altered or deleted after consensus; conflicts with GDPR right to erasure (Art. 17), right to rectification (Art. 16), storage limitation principle (Art. 5(1)(e)).
- **Off-chain storage**: Storing data outside blockchain in traditional databases; EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 recommend for personal data, with blockchain containing only references, cryptographic commitments, or anonymized summaries.
- **Personal data**: GDPR Art. 4(1) definition includes any information relating to identified or identifiable natural person; wallet addresses, transaction metadata, key share identifiers constitute personal data if linkable to users via KYC, IP addresses, transaction patterns.
- **Private/permissioned blockchain**: Blockchain with controlled access where known participants have explicit permissions to read/write; contrasts with public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum). EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 prefer private/permissioned for clear controller/processor roles and reduced third-country transfer risks.
- **Privacy by design**: Art. 25 GDPR principle requiring data protection built into system architecture from initial design stage; EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 mandate for blockchain applications, cannot be retrofitted after deployment.
- **Pseudonymization**: Processing making personal data non-attributable to specific data subject without additional information kept separately; GDPR Art. 4(5). Wallet addresses are pseudonymous identifiers but remain personal data per GDPR recital 26 if linkable via other means.
- **Right to erasure**: Art. 17 GDPR data subject right to obtain deletion of personal data; conflicts with blockchain immutability. EDPB Guidelines 02/2025 require deletion or irreversible anonymization capability, technical impossibility not valid excuse.
