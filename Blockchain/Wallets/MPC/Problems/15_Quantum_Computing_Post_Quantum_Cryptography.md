**Owner**: Cryptography & Security Research Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallet ecosystem faces existential threat from quantum computing advancement, where current cryptographic primitives (ECDSA signatures securing $50B+ assets, threshold signature protocols, cryptographic hashing) will become vulnerable when sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge (estimated 2030-2040 timeline by research consensus [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]), yet post-quantum migration lags severely across 15+ major providers (0% deploy post-quantum cryptography as of 2025 [Market observation]), creating time-sensitive risk: failure to migrate before "Q-Day" (quantum computers break current crypto) results in complete wallet compromise (private key extraction via Shor's algorithm, signature forgery, transaction interception), affecting 100M+ users and requiring multi-year blockchain-level hard forks (Bitcoin/Ethereum migration $500M-$2B estimated costs, 3-5 year timeline [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]) alongside wallet provider upgrades. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets rely on cryptographic primitives vulnerable to quantum attacks (ECDSA signatures breakable via Shor's algorithm in polynomial time, enabling private key extraction; threshold signature protocols based on discrete logarithm or elliptic curve assumptions similarly vulnerable; SHA-256 hashing weakened but not broken by Grover's algorithm requiring quadratic speedup [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]). Critical gaps: (1) Zero post-quantum deployment where no major MPC wallet provider implements NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+, MAYO released August 2024 [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024]) in production, despite 5-15 year quantum threat timeline creating narrow migration window; (2) Blockchain dependency where MPC wallets inherit underlying blockchain's quantum vulnerability (Bitcoin P2PK addresses expose public keys enabling immediate key extraction, P2PKH/P2TR addresses vulnerable during transaction broadcast window, Ethereum account-based model exposes public keys permanently [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]), requiring coordinated migration (wallet providers cannot unilaterally protect users if blockchain remains vulnerable); (3) Migration complexity where post-quantum algorithms impose significant overhead (CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures 2.4KB vs. ECDSA 64-72 bytes, 3-10× computational cost, MPC threshold adaptation research incomplete [NIST: Threshold Cryptography Project]) affecting throughput, storage, network bandwidth; (4) Timeline uncertainty where quantum computing progress predictions range widely (conservative 2040+, aggressive 2030, breakthrough scenarios 2027-2028 [Paper: Sevilla & Riedel, 2020]), creating strategic dilemma (migrate too early incurs cost without immediate benefit, too late enables catastrophic loss); (5) Backward compatibility where deployed wallets securing existing assets must migrate without losing access (cannot simply switch algorithms, require transition mechanisms supporting old and new crypto simultaneously, key rotation processes, user coordination).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Quantum computing threat established: Shor's algorithm (1994) demonstrated polynomial-time factorization and discrete logarithm solving on quantum computers [Paper: Shor, 1999], breaking RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and elliptic curve cryptography underlying blockchain security. Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search, weakening but not breaking SHA-256 (requires doubling key length, less severe than signature vulnerability) [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]. Quantum hardware progress: Google achieved "quantum supremacy" (2019, 53-qubit Sycamore processor) [Paper: Arute et al., 2019], IBM surpassed 100-qubit barrier (2021) [Blog: IBM Research, 2021], photonic quantum processors demonstrated computational advantage (2020-2022) [Paper: Zhong et al., 2020; Madsen et al., 2022]. Estimates for cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) capable of breaking 256-bit ECDSA: 2030-2040 consensus [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023; Sevilla & Riedel, 2020], requiring ~3000 logical qubits and millions of physical qubits with error correction. Bitcoin vulnerability: 3M BTC (~$150B at $50K/BTC) in P2PK addresses (public key exposed, immediately vulnerable) [Paper: Stewart et al., 2018]; P2PKH/P2TR addresses vulnerable during transaction broadcast (attacker front-runs transaction with quantum-computed signature, estimated 10-minute window) [Paper: Aggarwal et al., 2018]. Ethereum vulnerability: Account-based model exposes public keys for all accounts with transaction history; BLS signatures used in consensus vulnerable to quantum attack via hidden subgroup problem [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]. Post-quantum cryptography standardization: NIST launched PQC competition (2016), finalized first three standards (August 2024): FIPS 203 (ML-KEM lattice-based encryption), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA/CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA/SPHINCS+ stateless hash signatures) [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024]; additional candidates (Falcon compact signatures, MAYO multi-variate signatures) under review. Threshold cryptography challenge: MPC adapts classical signatures to threshold protocols; post-quantum threshold signatures active research area (NIST Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography project launched) [NIST: Threshold Cryptography], production-ready implementations limited. MPC wallet status: Zero providers deploy post-quantum cryptography in production (2025 market scan: Fireblocks, Coinbase WaaS, ZenGo, BitGo, Web3Auth, Privy, Magic, others all rely on ECDSA/EdDSA [Market observation]). Blockchain migration efforts: Bitcoin soft fork proposals discussed (integrate quantum-resistant signatures, timeline uncertain); Ethereum exploring Account Abstraction (ERC-4337, EIP-7701) enabling per-account cryptographic upgrade path plus post-quantum BLS alternatives [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]. Migration cost estimates: Bitcoin/Ethereum hard fork coordination $500M-$2B (development, testing, coordination, deployment across thousands of nodes), 3-5 year timeline [Estimate based on past upgrade complexity]. Historical precedent: Bitcoin Taproot upgrade (2021) took 2 years from proposal to activation despite broad consensus; Ethereum Merge (2022) took 3+ years [Blockchain upgrade history].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Research & standardization: Complete NIST threshold post-quantum cryptography standards → production-ready MPC threshold Dilithium/Falcon/SPHINCS+ specifications by Q4 2026 (current: ongoing research [NIST: Threshold Cryptography]). Proof-of-concept deployment: ≥3 major providers launching post-quantum MPC wallet testnet implementations by Q4 2026 (current: 0). Production deployment: ≥50% of major providers offering post-quantum MPC wallets in production by Q4 2027 (current: 0%); ≥80% by Q4 2028. Blockchain coordination: Bitcoin/Ethereum soft/hard forks introducing post-quantum signature support → testnet activation by Q2 2027 (current: proposal stage), mainnet activation by Q4 2028. Performance targets: Post-quantum MPC signature generation <5s (vs. current 2-3s ECDSA MPC), signature size <5KB (vs. 64-72B ECDSA), throughput degradation <50% (minimize impact from larger signatures + computational overhead). Migration tooling: 100% of providers offering seamless key migration tools (old ECDSA → new post-quantum keys with user consent, backward compatibility during transition) by Q2 2027. User adoption: ≥60% of institutional users (managing $30B+ assets) migrating to post-quantum wallets by Q4 2028 (minimize exposure window), ≥80% by Q4 2029. Asset recovery: Zero loss of access to existing funds during migration (no "bricking" of wallets, 100% successful key rotation/migration). Blockchain asset protection: ≥90% of Bitcoin/Ethereum assets migrated to quantum-resistant addresses by Q4 2030 (before conservative CRQC timeline 2030-2040 [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]). Hybrid deployment: Support hybrid classical/post-quantum cryptography during 2026-2030 transition (enable gradual migration, interoperability with non-upgraded systems). Monitoring & response: Establish quantum computing threat monitoring (track qubit count, error rates, algorithm implementations) → ≥3 major research institutions publishing quarterly threat assessments by Q2 2026; trigger accelerated migration if breakthrough detected.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q4 2025 - Q4 2030 (60 months covering research completion, standards finalization, testnet deployment, production rollout, blockchain forks, user migration before conservative CRQC timeline); Critical path: NIST threshold crypto standards (Q4 2026) → provider implementations (2027) → blockchain forks (2028) → mass user migration (2029-2030). Budget: $10M-$50M per major provider for post-quantum transition (cryptography research $2M-$5M, protocol development $3M-$10M including MPC threshold adaptation, testing/security audit $2M-$5M for new crypto, deployment infrastructure $2M-$10M supporting hybrid classical/post-quantum, user migration tooling $1M-$5M, education/support $1M-$5M); Blockchain fork costs $500M-$2B ecosystem-wide (development, audits, coordination, node upgrades). Team: Per provider requires 3-5 cryptography researchers (post-quantum MPC protocol design, security proofs), 5-10 senior engineers (implementation, testing, integration with existing systems), 2-3 security auditors (independent verification of quantum resistance claims), 2-4 DevOps engineers (deployment infrastructure, hybrid support), 3-5 customer success specialists (institutional migration support); Blockchain-level requires 10-20 core developers + hundreds of community contributors. Cryptographic constraints: Post-quantum signature size (CRYSTALS-Dilithium 2.4KB, Falcon 0.7KB compressed, SPHINCS+ 8-49KB depending on parameters [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024]) increases transaction size (Bitcoin block size limit 1MB, Ethereum gas costs scale with data, network bandwidth implications for signature propagation); Computational overhead (Dilithium signature generation 3-10× slower than ECDSA, verification 2-5× slower [NIST benchmarks]) impacts throughput; MPC threshold adaptation complexity (threshold Dilithium research incomplete, production implementation timeline uncertain). Blockchain upgrade constraints: Hard fork coordination requires consensus across thousands of independent nodes, miners/validators, exchanges, wallet providers (Bitcoin contentious forks historically take years, Ethereum coordination easier but still complex); Backward compatibility requirements (old clients must reject quantum-vulnerable transactions after fork, phased rollout necessary). Performance constraints: Transaction throughput must not degrade >50% (current Bitcoin ~7 TPS, Ethereum ~30 TPS post-Merge, degradation affects usability); Network bandwidth must support larger signatures (mobile/IoT clients may struggle with 2-8KB signatures vs. 64B ECDSA). Standardization constraints: NIST standards finalized but threshold adaptations incomplete (single-signer Dilithium specified, t-of-n threshold variant requires additional research [NIST: Threshold Cryptography]); Multiple competing algorithms (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate, isogeny-based) create choice complexity. Migration complexity: Existing deployed wallets must transition without loss of funds (cannot abandon old keys, require co-signing with old and new keys during transition, user consent necessary for key rotation); Billions of dollars in assets require secure migration (100M+ users, $50B+ total value, zero-downtime requirement).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     MPC Wallet Providers (15+ major companies managing $50B+ assets, need quantum-resistant wallets to maintain security claims, constraint: $10M-$50M per-provider migration cost + performance degradation + standardization timeline dependency); Institutional Users (managing $30B+ assets for fiduciary responsibility, need quantum protection before CRQC emergence 2030-2040, constraint: migration disruption risk + must coordinate with providers + education gap on quantum threat); Retail Users (70M+ individuals holding $20B+ assets, need seamless migration without technical complexity, constraint: lack quantum threat awareness + migration friction may delay adoption); Blockchain Core Developers (Bitcoin Core 10+ developers, Ethereum Foundation 50+ developers, need soft/hard fork coordination for post-quantum support, constraint: consensus-building takes years + backward compatibility complexity + $500M-$2B ecosystem cost); Cryptography Researchers (NIST, academic institutions, industry labs, need threshold post-quantum MPC protocol development, constraint: research timelines uncertain + competing algorithm trade-offs + standardization process slow); Security Auditors (Trail of Bits, NCC Group, Kudelski, need post-quantum audit methodologies, constraint: limited expertise in post-quantum cryptography + audit costs $300K-$1M comprehensive vs. $50K-$200K classical); Blockchain Validators/Miners (thousands of nodes, need node software upgrades, constraint: upgrade coordination friction + hardware requirements for post-quantum signature verification may increase); Exchanges & Custodians (100+ platforms, need post-quantum wallet support for customer fund security, constraint: integration complexity + must coordinate with multiple blockchains + regulatory uncertainty); Regulators (financial authorities, need quantum-resistant custody standards, constraint: lack technical quantum expertise + unclear timeline for mandates); Quantum Computing Companies (Google, IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, could accelerate threat timeline with breakthrough, constraint: progress visibility limited + incentive misalignment with crypto industry); Standards Bodies (NIST, ENISA, ISO, need threshold cryptography standards, constraint: deliberate process prioritizing security over speed + multiple competing algorithms); Academic Community (universities, research labs, need access to production systems for post-quantum research, constraint: closed-source MPC wallets limit research velocity); Open-Source Projects (Bitcoin Core, Ethereum clients, need community-driven post-quantum integration, constraint: volunteer capacity + funding limitations).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q4 2025 - Q4 2030 (60 months for research, standards, implementation, blockchain forks, mass migration before conservative 2030-2040 CRQC threat window [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]); Phases: (1) Q4 2025 - Q4 2026: NIST threshold crypto standards finalization, research prototypes; (2) Q1 2027 - Q4 2027: Provider testnet implementations, Bitcoin/Ethereum fork proposals; (3) Q1 2028 - Q4 2028: Production deployments, blockchain mainnet forks; (4) Q1 2029 - Q4 2030: Mass user migration, legacy system sunset. Systems: MPC threshold signature protocols (replace ECDSA/EdDSA with Dilithium/Falcon/SPHINCS+, adapt key generation, signing, verification to post-quantum primitives), cryptographic libraries (integrate NIST PQC standards FIPS 203/204/205, threshold adaptations), key management (hybrid key storage supporting classical + post-quantum keys during transition), wallet software (mobile/web/hardware clients supporting post-quantum signatures, signature size 2-8KB vs. 64B ECDSA), blockchain protocols (Bitcoin soft/hard fork adding post-quantum signature opcodes, Ethereum Account Abstraction + BLS alternatives), network layer (P2P propagation handling larger signatures, bandwidth optimization), storage layer (UTXO/account state with larger cryptographic proofs), consensus mechanisms (Bitcoin PoW unaffected by Grover's algorithm if hash length doubled, Ethereum PoS replacing BLS signatures), smart contracts (Ethereum contracts using post-quantum signature verification, compatibility layer for old signatures during transition), backup/recovery systems (post-quantum key share backups, encrypted storage with quantum-resistant encryption), hardware security modules (HSM firmware updates supporting post-quantum crypto, performance optimization for lattice operations); Current state: 100% of MPC wallets rely on quantum-vulnerable ECDSA/EdDSA [Market observation, 2025], NIST standards finalized (August 2024) but threshold adaptations incomplete [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024; NIST: Threshold Cryptography], blockchain post-quantum support proposal stage only [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]; Scale: $50B+ assets at immediate risk from CRQC, 100M+ users requiring wallet migration, 15+ major providers needing protocol upgrades, 2 major blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum securing $1T+ combined market cap) requiring hard forks, thousands of validator/miner nodes requiring software upgrades, 100+ exchanges requiring integration updates; Geographically global (quantum threat universal, mitigation requires worldwide coordination); Impact ripples: Failure to migrate before CRQC enables (1) Private key extraction (attacker computes private keys from public keys using Shor's algorithm on quantum computer, steals all funds from vulnerable addresses), (2) Transaction interception (attacker intercepts broadcast transactions, computes signature forgery, front-runs with conflicting transaction stealing funds), (3) Consensus attack (quantum adversary breaks BLS signatures, impersonates validators, controls block production), (4) Ecosystem collapse (loss of trust in blockchain security, mass exodus to quantum-resistant alternatives, $50B+ asset loss); Successful migration enables long-term security (crypto industry survives quantum era, maintains decentralization and trust, unlocks new quantum-resistant DeFi/Web3 applications).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2016-2024: NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition launched (2016) evaluating 82 initial candidates → finalized 3 standards (August 2024): FIPS 203 (ML-KEM lattice-based encryption), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA/CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA/SPHINCS+ stateless hash signatures) [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024]. Key lesson: Standardization takes 8+ years (rigorous security analysis, performance evaluation, community feedback cycles prioritize correctness over speed). Dilithium chosen for balance (2.4KB signatures acceptable, 3-10× slower than ECDSA but practical, lattice-based security well-studied); Falcon offers compactness (0.7KB compressed) but implementation complexity higher; SPHINCS+ maximally conservative (hash-based, no structured assumption) but large signatures (8-49KB depending on parameters). 2020-2025: NIST Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography project initiated addressing MPC threshold adaptations of post-quantum algorithms [NIST: Threshold Cryptography]. Research papers explore threshold Dilithium/Falcon (MPC-in-the-Head paradigm promising [Paper: Threshold Signatures from MPC-in-the-Head, 2024]), production implementations incomplete as of 2025. Key lesson: Threshold crypto lags single-party standards (additional complexity, security proof requirements, standardization process sequential not parallel). 2018-2023: Bitcoin quantum resistance proposals: Stewart et al. (2018) proposed "committing to quantum resistance" soft fork (add quantum-resistant signature opcodes, phased transition) [Paper: Stewart et al., 2018]; Aggarwal et al. (2018) analyzed attack vectors (P2PK immediate vulnerability, P2PKH front-running during broadcast) [Paper: Aggarwal et al., 2018]. Key lesson: Bitcoin community aware of threat but lacks urgency (quantum timeline perceived as distant, fork coordination friction, debate over algorithm choice). 2020-2025: Ethereum Account Abstraction development (ERC-4337 deployed 2023, EIP-7701 Native AA proposed) provides cryptographic agility (accounts specify own signature verification, enables per-account post-quantum migration without hard fork) [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]. Key lesson: Flexible architecture enables gradual migration (users opt-in to quantum-resistant signatures individually, reduces coordination burden vs. forced hard fork). 2019-2023: Quantum computing hardware progress: Google "quantum supremacy" (2019, 53 qubits, specialized problem) [Paper: Arute et al., 2019], IBM 100+ qubits (2021) [Blog: IBM Research, 2021], photonic quantum advantage (2020-2022) [Paper: Zhong et al., 2020; Madsen et al., 2022]. Key lesson: Qubit count growing but error correction remains bottleneck (CRQC requires millions of physical qubits with error correction for ~3000 logical qubits, timeline 2030-2040 consensus [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]); breakthrough scenarios possible (faster-than-expected error correction, alternative quantum computing paradigms like photonic or topological). 2023-2025: Industry awareness growing: Fireblocks published quantum threat blog series (2025) [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025], discussing Bitcoin/Ethereum vulnerabilities and migration paths; BlockDaemon highlighted post-quantum security as DeFi priority (2024) [Blog: BlockDaemon, 2024]. Key lesson: Awareness does not equal action (providers acknowledge threat but zero production deployments, waiting for standards + blockchain support + competitive pressure). No historical precedent: MPC wallets have not undergone cryptographic algorithm migration at scale (ECDSA/EdDSA adopted from inception, no experience with backward-compatible cryptographic transition affecting billions in deployed assets).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: Shor's algorithm breaks ECDSA/EdDSA in polynomial time on quantum computers [Paper: Shor, 1999]; Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup weakening but not breaking SHA-256 [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023]; NIST finalized 3 post-quantum standards August 2024 (FIPS 203/204/205: ML-KEM encryption, ML-DSA/Dilithium signatures, SLH-DSA/SPHINCS+ signatures) [NIST: PQC Standards, 2024]; CRQC timeline consensus 2030-2040 for breaking 256-bit ECDSA [Paper: Schärer & Comuzzi, 2023; Sevilla & Riedel, 2020]; Google achieved quantum supremacy 2019 (53 qubits) [Paper: Arute et al., 2019], IBM surpassed 100 qubits 2021 [Blog: IBM Research, 2021]; Bitcoin 3M BTC (~$150B) in P2PK addresses immediately vulnerable [Paper: Stewart et al., 2018]; Ethereum account-based model exposes public keys permanently [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]; Zero MPC wallet providers deploy post-quantum cryptography in production (2025 market scan: Fireblocks, Coinbase WaaS, ZenGo, BitGo, Web3Auth, Privy, Magic all use ECDSA/EdDSA [Market observation]); CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures 2.4KB vs. ECDSA 64-72B, 3-10× computational overhead [NIST benchmarks]; NIST threshold cryptography project ongoing, production standards incomplete [NIST: Threshold Cryptography]; Ethereum Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) deployed 2023 enabling per-account cryptographic upgrade [Blog: Fireblocks, 2025]; Bitcoin Taproot upgrade took 2 years (2019-2021), Ethereum Merge took 3+ years (2018-2022) [Blockchain upgrade history].
     - **Assumptions**: CRQC capable of breaking 256-bit ECDSA emerges 2030-2040 with 10-year uncertainty range (based on quantum computing progress forecasts [Paper: Sevilla & Riedel, 2020], could accelerate with breakthrough or delay with error correction challenges); Migration timeline 2025-2030 sufficient if started immediately (5-year window covers research, standards, implementation, deployment, user migration, assumes no major delays); Estimated costs per provider $10M-$50M (cryptography research $2M-$5M, protocol development $3M-$10M, testing/audit $2M-$5M, deployment $2M-$10M, migration tooling $1M-$5M, education $1M-$5M, assumes large provider scale); Blockchain fork costs $500M-$2B (Bitcoin/Ethereum ecosystem-wide coordination, development, testing, deployment across thousands of nodes, based on historical upgrade complexity but no direct precedent for cryptographic overhaul); NIST threshold post-quantum standards complete by Q4 2026 (extrapolating from NIST single-party PQC timeline 2016-2024, assuming faster progress given foundation established); Performance degradation <50% acceptable to users (threshold signature generation <5s vs. 2-3s current, signature size <5KB, assuming users tolerate modest slowdown for quantum security); ≥50% of institutional users migrate by Q4 2028 (assumes awareness campaigns successful + compliance pressure + fear of quantum threat motivates action); Hybrid classical/post-quantum deployment feasible during 2026-2030 transition (wallets support both ECDSA and Dilithium simultaneously, users gradually migrate, assumes interoperability challenges solvable).
     - **Uncertainties**: When will CRQC actually emerge? (Consensus 2030-2040 but high uncertainty; breakthrough scenarios 2027-2028 possible with unexpected error correction progress or alternative quantum computing paradigms; pessimistic scenarios 2045+ if quantum error correction proves harder than expected); Which post-quantum algorithm optimal for MPC threshold? (Dilithium chosen by NIST but threshold adaptation complexity uncertain; Falcon offers smaller signatures but implementation difficulty higher; SPHINCS+ maximally conservative but 8-49KB signatures may be impractical for blockchain; algorithm choice affects performance/size trade-offs); How quickly can blockchain forks coordinate? (Bitcoin contentious forks historically take years and may fail, Ethereum faster but still complex; quantum threat may not generate urgency until too late; alternative: some users may migrate to quantum-resistant blockchains instead of waiting for Bitcoin/Ethereum forks); Will performance degradation be acceptable? (3-10× slower signature generation, 2.4-8KB signatures vs. 64B; blockchain throughput impact unclear; mobile/IoT clients may struggle with larger signatures; user tolerance for slower transactions unknown); Can seamless migration be achieved? (Key rotation without losing access to existing funds is critical but complex; hybrid deployments supporting old and new keys add complexity; user error risk during migration could result in fund loss); What is optimal migration timeline? (Migrate too early incurs cost and performance degradation before necessary; too late risks CRQC breakthrough catching unprepared systems; optimal timing depends on quantum threat monitoring); How effective is quantum threat monitoring? (Tracking qubit count, error rates, algorithm implementations to detect acceleration; transparency limited—quantum computing companies may not disclose breakthrough until after achieving CRQC); Will users actually migrate? (Institutional users likely motivated by fiduciary duty; retail users may lack urgency or awareness; how to incentivize migration without forced hard fork?); What about post-quantum encryption? (NIST FIPS 203 ML-KEM for encryption; MPC wallets primarily use signatures not encryption; but secure channels, backup encryption also need quantum resistance; less critical than signature vulnerability but non-zero risk); Are there alternative quantum-resistant approaches? (Hash-based signatures, isogeny-based crypto, multivariate crypto; NIST selected lattice + hash; ongoing research may discover better alternatives; standardization lock-in vs. agility trade-off).
