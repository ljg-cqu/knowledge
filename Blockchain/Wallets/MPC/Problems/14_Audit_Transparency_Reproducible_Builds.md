# Audit Transparency and Reproducible Builds in MPC Wallet Ecosystem

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security Audit & Transparency Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[Important]** Q: MPC wallet ecosystem suffers from insufficient audit transparency and lack of reproducible build verification, where most implementations remain closed-source (preventing independent security review), published security audits cover limited scope (focusing on protocol correctness but not implementation vulnerabilities, supply chain risks, or operational security), reproducible builds absent (users cannot verify deployed binaries match audited source code), and continuous security monitoring rare, undermining trust in systems securing $50B+ assets serving 100M+ users despite MPC's security claims. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets market superior security through distributed cryptography but lack transparency mechanisms enabling independent verification [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]. Critical trust gaps: (1) Closed-source implementations where majority of major providers (Fireblocks, Coinbase WaaS, ZenGo, BitGo, others) deploy proprietary code preventing community security review, independent audit, or academic scrutiny [Market landscape, 2025], contrast with blockchain's transparency ethos and open-source security model (Bitcoin Core, Ethereum clients publicly auditable); (2) Limited audit scope where published security reports ($50K-$200K per audit) focus narrowly on cryptographic protocol correctness (verifying MPC math) but rarely cover implementation vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows, memory corruption), supply chain security (dependency vulnerabilities, build process integrity), operational security (server hardening, access controls, incident response), or continuous monitoring (audits are point-in-time snapshots, vulnerabilities introduced post-audit undetected) [Security audit practices]; (3) Reproducible build absence where users cannot verify mobile apps (iOS App Store, Google Play Store binaries) or server deployments match audited source code (if code even disclosed), enabling supply chain attacks through malicious build process, compromised developer accounts, or app store man-in-the-middle injection [Blog: Safeheron, 2024; AWS reproducible builds]; (4) Audit result opacity where security findings disclosed selectively (critical vulnerabilities patched quietly without public disclosure, audit scope limitations not highlighted, residual risks not communicated), users lack framework for comparing provider security (Provider A audited by Firm X for protocol only, Provider B audited by Firm Y covering broader scope—incomparable) [Audit disclosure practices]; (5) Open-source projects limited where few MPC implementations publicly available (Safeheron open-source MPC library, academic reference implementations, some protocol-specific libraries) [Blog: Safeheron, 2024], but major consumer-facing wallets remain closed limiting community contributions, vulnerability discovery, and independent verification. Impact: Users must trust provider claims without verification mechanisms (contrast with hardware wallets where Trezor, Ledger publish source code enabling community audit), sophisticated attackers exploit implementation bugs undetected by narrow audits (Coinbase MPC library error-handling flaw discovered internally, no public disclosure timeline [Blog: Coinbase, 2024]), supply chain compromises possible without reproducible builds (malicious updates injected into deployment without user knowledge), regulatory concerns (institutional custody requires audit transparency, lack of verifiable security complicates compliance). Resolution requires open-source adoption (public codebases enabling community review), comprehensive audit standards (protocol + implementation + supply chain + operational security coverage), reproducible build infrastructure (users verify deployed binaries match audited source), continuous security monitoring (automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, bug bounty programs), and transparent disclosure (public audit reports, vulnerability timelines, residual risk communication).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Blockchain security model baseline: Bitcoin Core, Ethereum clients, major DeFi protocols publish open-source code enabling community security review (thousands of developers inspect code, independent researchers discover vulnerabilities, academic analysis verifies claims) [Open-source blockchain security]. Hardware wallet precedent: Trezor fully open-source (firmware, hardware schematics public), Ledger increasingly open (after initial closed-source controversy, moved to open firmware), community audits discovered vulnerabilities benefiting ecosystem security [Hardware wallet transparency evolution]. Smart contract wallet transparency: Gnosis Safe (now Safe), multisig wallets publish verified source code on Etherscan (users inspect on-chain logic), security audits public (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Consensys Diligence publish reports) [Smart contract audit standards]. MPC wallet transparency reality: Majority closed-source [Market observation, 2025]. Fireblocks: Proprietary implementation, security details limited (published research on vulnerabilities in competitors' protocols [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023] but own implementation not public). Coinbase WaaS: Closed-source service, published open-source MPC library (cb-mpc) after error-handling flaw discovery but wallet service proprietary [Blog: Coinbase, 2024]. ZenGo: Consumer wallet closed-source, security model (2-of-2 with server share) requires trusting ZenGo server implementation. BitGo, Web3Auth, Privy, Magic, others: Proprietary implementations, security through obscurity rather than transparency. Exception: Safeheron published open-source MPC wallet library (Go implementation, GitHub public) enabling community review [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]. Academic implementations: CGGMP21, GG18/GG20 reference code available but not production-ready, limited audit. Security audit landscape: Published audits vary dramatically in scope. Typical audit ($50K-$200K) covers: (1) Cryptographic protocol review (MPC math correctness, zero-knowledge proof soundness, threat model analysis) consuming 60-80% of audit time; (2) High-level architecture review (share distribution, key generation, signing flow); (3) Limited implementation review (critical code paths, cryptographic library usage, but not exhaustive line-by-line analysis) [Security audit firm practices]. Audits rarely cover: Supply chain security (dependency vulnerabilities, build process integrity, developer key management), operational security (server hardening, access controls, secrets management, incident response procedures), continuous monitoring (audits point-in-time, post-audit vulnerabilities undetected), threat modeling for combined attacks (mobile compromise + server breach scenarios), performance-security trade-offs (honest-but-curious vs. malicious security disclosure [Blog: Cubist, 2024]). Audit result disclosure selective: Critical vulnerabilities patched quietly (vendors prefer private disclosure avoiding reputational damage), scope limitations not highlighted (audit covered protocol but not implementation—users assume comprehensive review), residual risks not communicated (known limitations, open research questions, threat model assumptions not stated clearly). Reproducible builds absent: Mobile apps (iOS/Android) distributed through app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) where users download pre-compiled binaries with no verification mechanism [App distribution model]. Even if source code published, users cannot verify deployed app matches source (build process includes proprietary signing, app store wrapping, no reproducible build attestation) [Blog: AWS reproducible builds; Blog: Safeheron, 2024]. Server deployments opaque (cloud-hosted MPC signing services run proprietary code, no mechanism for users to audit deployed software). Supply chain attack risk acute: Compromised developer accounts (GitHub account takeover, npm package hijacking [npm security incidents]), malicious dependencies (compromised libraries injected into build process), build pipeline attacks (CI/CD compromise inserting backdoors [SolarWinds precedent]), app store man-in-the-middle (less likely but theoretically possible, rogue apps impersonating legitimate wallets). Coinbase MPC library incident illustrative: Error-handling flaw in previous version of WaaS discovered internally, not practically exploitable but demonstrates implementation bugs escape protocol-level audits [Blog: Coinbase, 2024]. Fireblocks responsible disclosure of competitor vulnerabilities (GG18/GG20 Paillier key validation issues [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]) benefited ecosystem but highlights fragmented security coordination without standardized disclosure.
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Open-source adoption: Achieve ≥40% of major providers publishing production-grade open-source implementations by Q4 2027 (current: <10% estimated, mostly academic code or limited libraries vs. full wallet implementations). Code transparency: Require 100% of providers publishing mobile app source code (iOS/Android) enabling community review by Q4 2026 (current: nearly all closed-source), excluding legitimate trade secrets (business logic, proprietary optimizations) but including cryptographic implementation, key storage, signing protocols. Audit comprehensiveness: Establish industry-standard audit scope covering (1) Protocol correctness, (2) Implementation security (memory safety, input validation, error handling), (3) Supply chain security (dependency audit, build integrity), (4) Operational security (server hardening, access controls), achieving ≥60% of audits meeting comprehensive standard by Q4 2027 (current: most audits protocol-only). Audit transparency: Achieve 100% of major providers publishing security audit reports publicly (redacting only critical exploitation details temporarily, full disclosure after patching) by Q2 2026 (current: many audits private, selective disclosure). Reproducible builds: Implement reproducible build infrastructure → ≥50% of mobile wallet apps providing reproducible build verification (users can compile source and verify hash matches app store binary) by Q4 2027 (current: 0% estimated). Supply chain attestation: Adopt software supply chain security frameworks (Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA) → ≥70% of providers implementing signed commits, CI/CD attestations, dependency verification by Q4 2027 (current: <30% estimated [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]). Continuous monitoring: Establish ongoing security programs → 100% of providers implementing (1) Automated vulnerability scanning, (2) Annual penetration testing, (3) Public bug bounty programs (≥$10K max payout encouraging disclosure) by Q4 2026 (current: limited ongoing programs). Audit comparison framework: Create standardized security scorecard enabling users to compare providers objectively (Protocol audit: Y/N, Implementation audit: Y/N, Supply chain audit: Y/N, Reproducible builds: Y/N, Bug bounty: Y/N + max payout, Last audit date, Vulnerability disclosure timeline) published for ≥80% of providers by Q2 2026 (current: no standardized comparison). Vulnerability disclosure: Adopt responsible disclosure policies → 100% of providers publishing (1) Security email/bug bounty program, (2) 90-day public disclosure timeline (report → patch → public disclosure), (3) CVE assignments for vulnerabilities by Q2 2026 (current: inconsistent disclosure practices). Community engagement: Foster open-source community → ≥5 major open-source MPC wallet implementations with ≥100 contributors each (similar to Bitcoin Core, go-ethereum scale) by Q4 2028 (current: 1-2 limited projects).
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2028 (36 months for open-source transitions + comprehensive audits + reproducible build infrastructure + community building); Budget: $1M-$5M per major provider for transparency initiatives (open-sourcing code $200K-$1M legal review + refactoring, comprehensive audits $300K-$1M covering protocol + implementation + supply chain + operational, reproducible builds $200K-$800K tooling + CI/CD + verification infrastructure, bug bounty program $100K-$500K annual payouts, community engagement $200K-$1M developer relations + documentation); Team: Per provider requires 2-4 security engineers (code audit, vulnerability remediation, security monitoring), 1-2 legal/compliance specialists (open-source licensing, audit disclosure policies, intellectual property review), 2-3 DevOps engineers (reproducible build infrastructure, CI/CD security, supply chain attestation), 1-2 community managers (open-source governance, contributor onboarding, bug bounty administration), 2-3 technical writers (documentation for open-source projects, audit report summaries); Intellectual property constraints: Providers resist open-sourcing citing competitive differentiation (proprietary optimizations, business logic, integration partnerships), trade secret concerns (revealing architecture enables competitors), patent risks (contributing code may expose to patent litigation); Legal/compliance constraints: Security audit disclosure may reveal vulnerabilities exploitable before all users update (coordinated disclosure timelines complex), regulatory requirements unclear (some jurisdictions may require custody code transparency, others prohibit cryptographic export), liability concerns (open-source contributors may introduce vulnerabilities, license choices affect responsibility); Technical challenges: Reproducible builds difficult (deterministic compilation across platforms, handling proprietary SDK signing, app store wrapping complicates verification), supply chain attestation requires industry coordination (Sigstore adoption, in-toto framework integration, dependency verification across language ecosystems), continuous monitoring expensive (automated scanning $10K-$50K annual tools, penetration testing $50K-$200K per test, bug bounties unlimited liability if critical vulnerability discovered); Resource allocation trade-offs: Security transparency investment competes with feature development (engineering resources finite, management prioritizes user-facing features over invisible security improvements), audit costs significant ($300K-$1M comprehensive vs. $50K-$200K protocol-only), bug bounty payouts unpredictable (major vulnerability could cost $50K-$500K payout beyond budgeted amounts); Community building challenges: Open-source requires sustained effort (documentation, issue triage, pull request review, community governance), cryptographic expertise barrier high (MPC protocol complexity limits contributor pool, threshold signatures require graduate-level understanding), sustaining open-source projects difficult (volunteer burnout, funding challenges, benevolent dictator risks).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     MPC Wallet Providers (15+ companies, need user trust through transparency vs. competitive differentiation through closed-source, constraint: open-sourcing costs $1M-$5M per provider + reduces IP moat + increases support burden); End Users - Institutional (managing $50B+ assets, need verifiable security for fiduciary responsibility, constraint: lack technical expertise to audit code even if published, rely on third-party certifications); End Users - Sophisticated (developers, security researchers, power users, need code transparency to verify security claims independently, constraint: limited in number but vocal, influence adoption decisions); Security Audit Firms (Trail of Bits, NCC Group, Kudelski Security, Least Authority, 10+ firms, need comprehensive audit standards preventing scope creep, constraint: comprehensive audits 3-5× more expensive than protocol-only, clients resist higher costs); Open-Source Community (thousands of developers potentially contributing, need welcoming projects with good documentation + governance, constraint: MPC complexity creates high barrier to entry, sustained contribution requires funding); Regulators (financial authorities, need custody transparency for oversight, constraint: lack technical capability to review code, require third-party certification programs); Academic Researchers (cryptography professors, PhD students advancing MPC protocols, need access to production implementations for research, constraint: closed-source limits research velocity, cannot validate theoretical improvements on real systems); Software Supply Chain Security Vendors (Sigstore, GitHub, Sonatype, need adoption of attestation frameworks, constraint: crypto industry slower to adopt enterprise security practices than traditional software); Bug Bounty Platforms (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, administering disclosure programs, need providers launching programs, constraint: MPC vulnerability assessment requires specialized cryptographic expertise, typical bug hunters lack skills); Competitors (other wallet providers, benefit from open-source implementations improving industry security, constraint: free-rider problem where some providers contribute code while others just consume); Institutional Investors & Custodians (pension funds, endowments, family offices requiring custody security verification, need independent audit transparency, constraint: fiduciary responsibility requires verifiable security not just vendor claims); Legal/Compliance Teams (within wallet providers, need to balance transparency with IP protection, vulnerability disclosure liability, regulatory requirements, constraint: novel legal territory with limited precedent for cryptographic custody code disclosure).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2028 (36 months for open-source adoption + comprehensive audit standards + reproducible build infrastructure + community maturation); Systems: Source code repositories (GitHub, GitLab with public access, contribution guidelines, security policies), mobile applications (iOS/Android source code, build instructions, reproducible build scripts), server implementations (MPC signing services, key management, backup/recovery systems), cryptographic libraries (threshold signature implementations, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption), security audit frameworks (protocol audit checklists, implementation review methodologies, supply chain assessment tools, operational security evaluation criteria), reproducible build tooling (deterministic compilation pipelines, CI/CD attestation, hash verification mechanisms), supply chain security (Sigstore signed commits, in-toto pipeline attestations, SLSA build level verification, dependency vulnerability scanning), bug bounty programs (HackerOne/Bugcrowd platforms, disclosure policies, payout structures, CVE assignment processes), continuous monitoring (automated vulnerability scanners, SAST/DAST tools, annual penetration testing, red team exercises), documentation (security architecture docs, threat models, audit reports, vulnerability disclosures); Current state: Majority closed-source (estimated <10% production-grade open-source MPC wallets), limited audit transparency (selective disclosure, narrow scope covering protocol not implementation/supply chain/operational), zero reproducible builds (users cannot verify deployed binaries), fragmented disclosure (no standardized vulnerability reporting), limited community engagement (few open-source projects, minimal contributors); Scale: 15+ major providers requiring transparency initiatives, 100M+ users needing verifiable security, $50B+ assets requiring trust mechanisms, thousands of potential open-source contributors, hundreds of security researchers capable of MPC auditing, dozens of institutional custodians requiring audit transparency for compliance; Risk: Closed-source implementations conceal vulnerabilities (implementation bugs escape narrow protocol audits [Blog: Coinbase, 2024], supply chain attacks undetected without reproducible builds, operational security weaknesses hidden from oversight), selective audit disclosure misleads users (assume comprehensive review when only protocol audited, residual risks not communicated), lack of independent verification enables vendor lock-in (users cannot compare security objectively, regulatory scrutiny increases without transparency, academic research hindered by closed implementations limiting protocol advancement); Use cases: Institutional custody (pension funds requiring verifiable security for fiduciary compliance), DeFi protocol treasuries (DAO governance requiring transparent custody security), consumer wallets (power users demanding code transparency), cross-chain bridges (MPC-based custody for wrapped assets requiring public audit), regulatory compliance (financial authorities requiring custody transparency for licensing); Regions: Global (transparency expectations vary, EU GDPR/MiCA frameworks require audits, US SEC custody rules emphasize security verification, Asian markets variable regulatory approaches).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2017-2020: Early MPC wallets (Fireblocks, Unbound Security, ZenGo) prioritized speed-to-market over transparency, closed-source implementations standard [Market evolution]. Security audits limited (expensive at $50K-$200K, focused narrowly on protocol correctness not comprehensive security). Hardware wallet transparency evolution provided model: Trezor launched fully open-source (2014, firmware + hardware schematics public), Ledger initially closed-source (2016 backlash from crypto community demanding transparency), gradual opening (2018-2020 firmware published, hardware schematics remain proprietary) [Hardware wallet history]. Key lesson: Transparency pressure from community + competition (Trezor open vs. Ledger closed) drove opening. 2020-2022: Smart contract wallet audits set precedent for DeFi. Gnosis Safe (multisig), Argent (smart contract wallet), Compound (lending protocol) published open-source code + third-party audit reports publicly (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin reports on protocol websites) [DeFi audit standards]. Bug bounty programs became standard (Immunefi platform, $1M+ payouts for critical DeFi vulnerabilities incentivizing white-hat disclosure) [DeFi security practices]. MPC wallets slower to adopt (closed-source inertia, higher audit costs $300K-$1M comprehensive vs. $50K-$200K smart contract, smaller addressable market limiting bug bounty budgets). 2023: Fireblocks published research on competitor protocol vulnerabilities (GG18/GG20 Paillier key issues affecting ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, Binance, others [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]), demonstrating value of academic-style disclosure but also competitive dynamics (revealing competitors' flaws without open-sourcing own implementation). Coinbase open-sourced cb-mpc library after discovering internal error-handling flaw, stated: "not practically exploitable" but published code enabling community review [Blog: Coinbase, 2024]. Key lesson: Incidents drive transparency (vulnerability discovery motivates disclosure + open-sourcing to demonstrate security rigor). 2024: Safeheron published open-source MPC wallet library (Go implementation, GitHub, documented architecture) [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]. Reproducible builds discussion: AWS published blog on reproducible builds for enclave verification (Nitro Enclaves use attestation proving code integrity [Blog: AWS, 2024]), mobile wallet ecosystem lacked similar mechanisms. Sigstore adoption growing in traditional software (npm provenance, Python wheel signing) but crypto wallets slow to implement [Software supply chain security evolution]. 2024-2025: Audit scope broadening: Some firms (Trail of Bits, Least Authority) began offering comprehensive audits (protocol + implementation + supply chain) at higher cost $300K-$1M, adoption limited by budget constraints [Security audit evolution]. Bug bounty programs launched by some providers (Fireblocks Immunefi program, Coinbase HackerOne) but participation limited (MPC vulnerability assessment requires specialized cryptographic expertise, typical bug hunters lack skills, payouts lower than DeFi $10K-$50K vs. $100K-$1M) [Bug bounty landscape]. Continuous monitoring inconsistent: Some providers automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot for dependency CVEs), annual penetration testing, but many lacked ongoing programs [Security practices variation]. Current state: Momentum toward transparency (incidents drive disclosure, institutional clients demand audits, open-source projects emerging) but majority closed-source, audits protocol-focused, reproducible builds absent.
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: Majority of major MPC wallet providers closed-source (market observation, <10% publish production code); Trezor fully open-source, Ledger moved to open firmware after community pressure [Hardware wallet history]; Smart contract wallets (Safe/Gnosis, Argent) publish source + audit reports [DeFi standards]; Typical security audits $50K-$200K focusing on protocol correctness [Audit firm pricing]; Fireblocks disclosed GG18/GG20 vulnerabilities affecting competitors 2023 [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]; Coinbase open-sourced cb-mpc after internal error-handling flaw discovery [Blog: Coinbase, 2024]; Safeheron published open-source MPC library [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]; Reproducible builds absent for mobile MPC wallets (users cannot verify binaries); Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA frameworks exist for supply chain attestation [Software supply chain security tools]; DeFi bug bounties pay $100K-$1M for critical vulnerabilities [Immunefi data].
     - **Assumptions**: <10% of providers publish production-grade open-source code (estimated from market scan: Safeheron + few academic implementations vs. 15+ major closed providers); <30% implement software supply chain security (Sigstore signed commits, dependency verification [Blog: Safeheron, 2024]); $1M-$5M per provider for comprehensive transparency initiatives (open-sourcing legal + refactoring, comprehensive audits $300K-$1M, reproducible builds $200K-$800K, bug bounty $100K-$500K annual, community engagement $200K-$1M); Comprehensive audits (protocol + implementation + supply chain + operational) cost $300K-$1M vs. $50K-$200K protocol-only (estimated from audit firm capabilities + time requirements); 0% of mobile wallets provide reproducible builds currently (no public examples found); 60-80% of typical audit time spent on protocol review (based on audit firm focus, implementation review limited in narrow-scope audits); Bug bounty payouts lower for MPC than DeFi ($10K-$50K vs. $100K-$1M) due to specialized expertise required + smaller user bases.
     - **Uncertainties**: What percentage of providers actually implement comprehensive security audits vs. narrow protocol-only? (Audit scope proprietary, no public disclosure); How many users would actually verify reproducible builds if available? (Technical barrier high, unclear demand); What is optimal balance between transparency and competitive differentiation? (How much IP genuinely proprietary vs. security theater?); Will open-sourcing reduce or increase vulnerability discovery rate? (More eyes finding bugs vs. exposing attack surface); What is liability for open-source contributions? (If community contributor introduces bug, who's responsible?); How to sustain open-source MPC projects? (Volunteer burnout, funding models unclear, corporate backing vs. independence trade-offs); What should comprehensive audit cost? ($300K-$1M reasonable or inflated? Market will determine); How effective are bug bounties for MPC? (Require specialized cryptographic expertise, can typical bug hunters contribute?); Will regulators mandate transparency? (EU MiCA, US custody rules direction uncertain); What is reproducible build adoption feasibility? (Technical challenges: deterministic compilation, app store signing, platform variations); What disclosure timeline balances security and transparency? (90-day standard or adjust for MPC complexity?); How to compare audits across different firms/scopes? (Standardized scorecard feasible or too complex?).

## Glossary

- **Comprehensive audit**: Security review covering (1) Protocol correctness, (2) Implementation security (memory safety, error handling), (3) Supply chain security (dependency audit, build integrity), (4) Operational security (server hardening, access controls); contrasts with narrow protocol-only audits.
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: Standardized identifier for publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities; enables tracking across industry, comparing severity (CVSS scores), coordinating patches.
- **In-toto**: Software supply chain security framework providing cryptographic attestation of CI/CD pipeline steps; verifies code → build → deploy integrity.
- **Reproducible builds**: Build process enabling independent verification that published binary matches source code through deterministic compilation; prevents supply chain injection attacks.
- **Responsible disclosure**: Security vulnerability reporting practice: researcher reports privately → vendor patches → public disclosure after 90 days (or coordinated timeline); balances transparency and security.
- **Sigstore**: Software signing infrastructure providing free code signing + transparency log; enables verifying signed commits, release artifacts, CI/CD outputs without private key distribution.
- **SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts)**: Framework defining security levels for software supply chain (Level 0: no guarantees → Level 4: comprehensive audited build); enables comparing provider security posture.
- **Supply chain attack**: Compromise of software development/distribution pipeline injecting malicious code; examples: compromised dependencies, build process backdoors, developer account takeover, app store man-in-the-middle.
- **Trade secret**: Proprietary information providing competitive advantage (business logic, optimizations); legal protection conflicts with open-source transparency, providers cite to resist code publication.
