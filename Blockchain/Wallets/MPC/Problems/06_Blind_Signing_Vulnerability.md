# Blind Signing Vulnerability in MPC Wallets

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallet users face blind signing vulnerabilities where multiple parties approve transactions without understanding their actual behavior, enabling attackers to execute malicious contract interactions, drainer attacks, and approval scams despite distributed key security. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets solved private key security through distributed cryptography but left transaction approval vulnerable to blind signing attacks, where users authorize transactions without understanding contract behavior, parameters, or downstream effects. Attackers exploit this gap through approval scams (unlimited ERC-20 allowances), drainer contracts (recursive withdrawals), phishing simulations (fake transaction previews), and malicious DApp integrations, causing est. $1.8B+ in 2024 crypto theft despite MPC key protection. Institutional custody providers, exchanges, and consumer wallet platforms (serving 100M+ users) face regulatory pressure to implement transaction verification while maintaining <3s approval latency.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     MPC wallets distribute key control but require each signer to approve transaction payloads (raw bytes: to address, value, data field) without semantic interpretation [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. Users see "Approve transaction to 0x742d...35A3" but not that data field contains "approve(spender, 2^256-1)" granting unlimited token access [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. Basic simulation exists but misses complex attack patterns: drainers use legitimate contract patterns that look safe in isolation but chain together maliciously, phishing sites present fake transaction previews matching benign operations while submitting different payloads, approval scams request "reasonable" 100 token allowance in UI while encoding unlimited approval [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. Hardware wallets face same blind signing vulnerability (Ledger, Trezor display only partial data due to screen constraints) [Blog: Blockaid, 2024]. Current detection relies on basic checks: known malicious addresses (99% of attackers use fresh addresses [implied from Hypernative, 2025]), gas price anomalies (legitimate transactions also spike gas during congestion), transaction value (approval attacks use 0 ETH transfers) [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. Regulatory pressure mounting: EU MiCA requires custody providers demonstrate transaction verification, SEC custody rule 206(4)-2 requires "reasonable assurances" that client transactions match instructions [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. 2024 crypto theft $2.2B with est. 80% involving transaction-level attacks bypassing MPC key security [Report: Chainalysis, 2025].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Attack prevention: Reduce blind signing losses from est. $1.8B/year (current 80% of $2.2B total theft) → <$500M/year (min) / <$200M/year (target) / <$50M/year (ideal) by Q4 2025. Detection accuracy: Achieve malicious transaction detection with 95% true positive rate (min) / 99% (target) / 99.9% (ideal) and <1% false positive rate (max) / <0.1% (target). User experience: Maintain transaction approval latency <5s (min) / <3s (target) / <1s (ideal) including verification. Regulatory compliance: Achieve 100% MiCA transaction verification requirements by Q3 2025, SEC custody rule compliance for institutional providers. Enterprise adoption: Enable institutional custody providers to demonstrate transaction verification to auditors (currently <30% can do so) → ≥80% (min) / ≥95% (target) by Q4 2025.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025 - Q4 2025 (9 months); Budget: $800K-$2M for verification engine development + behavioral analysis models + integration; Team: 3-4 security researchers + 4-6 backend engineers + 2-3 ML engineers + 1-2 compliance specialists; Technology: Real-time transaction simulation (<1s latency), behavioral analysis of contract interactions, historical attack pattern database, multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism), semantic transaction decoding (ERC-20, ERC-721, DeFi protocols); Compatibility: Must integrate with existing MPC signing flows without requiring protocol changes, backward compatible with current wallet deployments; User experience: Cannot add >3s latency to transaction approval (would cause 15-25% abandonment), must present verification results in non-technical language for consumer users; Accuracy: False positives <1% (blocking legitimate transactions damages user trust and creates support burden).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     End Users - Consumer Wallets (est. 50M+ using MPC wallets, need protection from approval scams and drainers, constraint: <3s transaction approval expected); End Users - Institutional Traders (est. 5,000+ professional traders, need rapid verification for high-frequency trading, constraint: verification latency blocks time-sensitive strategies); MPC Wallet Providers (15+ companies: Fireblocks, ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, BitGo, need regulatory compliance demonstration, constraint: $800K-$2M integration cost per provider); Cryptocurrency Exchanges (20+ major platforms, need customer protection from phishing attacks, constraint: cannot force verification on users who want "fast mode"); Custody Providers (100+ institutional, need SEC custody rule compliance, constraint: auditors require transaction verification audit trails); DApp Developers (1,000+ building Web3 applications, need legitimate transactions approved quickly, constraint: false positives damage user experience); Regulators (EU MiCA, SEC, need custody providers demonstrate transaction verification, constraint: cannot dictate specific technical implementations).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025 - Q4 2025 (9 months research + development + deployment); Systems: Transaction verification engine, smart contract simulation layer, behavioral analysis models, attack pattern database, semantic transaction decoder, multi-chain RPC integration, MPC signing flow integration; Scale: 15+ MPC wallet providers, 100M+ end users, 1,000+ DApp integrations; Current impact: est. $1.8B annual losses from blind signing attacks (80% of $2.2B 2024 crypto theft), <30% institutional providers can demonstrate transaction verification for auditors; Regulatory risk: EU MiCA non-compliance penalties up to 5% annual turnover or €5M, SEC custody rule violations result in license suspension; Use cases: Consumer wallets, institutional custody, exchange withdrawal verification, DeFi protocol interactions, NFT marketplace transactions; Regions: Global (regulatory pressure highest in EU, US, but attacks worldwide).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2018-2020: Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) attempted "blind signing" warnings on screen but users ignored due to lack of context, screen size limits prevented showing complete transaction details [Blog: Blockaid, 2024]. 2021-2022: Basic address blacklists deployed by MetaMask and others, blocking known scam addresses; ineffective as attackers use fresh addresses for 99% of attacks [implied from Hypernative, 2025]. 2022-2023: Transaction simulation adopted (Tenderly, Blocknative) showing state changes (token balance -100 USDC, +50 ETH), but missed approval scams (approvals show 0 value transfer despite granting unlimited access) and drainer contracts (legitimate-looking first interaction, malicious subsequent calls) [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. 2023-2024: OpenSea, Uniswap added approval limit warnings ("This transaction requests unlimited approval"), reduced some attacks but users still approve without understanding implications [implied from Hypernative, 2025]. 2024: Hypernative launched behavioral transaction verification analyzing historical contract behavior, call chains, and attack pattern matching; early adoption by institutional providers [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]. Key lesson: Signature-based blacklists fail against fresh addresses; simulation alone misses complex attack chains requiring behavioral and historical context; user warnings insufficient without semantic interpretation of malicious behavior.
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: $2.2B crypto theft in 2024 [Report: Chainalysis, 2025]; 80% of attacks involve transaction-level exploits bypassing key security [implied from theft patterns]; MPC wallets display raw transaction fields (to, value, data) without semantic interpretation [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]; Hardware wallets face same blind signing vulnerability [Blog: Blockaid, 2024]; EU MiCA requires transaction verification for custody providers (effective Q3 2025) [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]; SEC custody rule 206(4)-2 requires "reasonable assurances" [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]; Basic simulation misses approval scams, drainer contracts, and phishing attacks [Blog: Hypernative, 2025]; 99% of attackers use fresh addresses (blacklists ineffective) [implied from attack patterns].
     - **Assumptions**: est. $1.8B blind signing losses (80% of $2.2B total = $1.76B, rounded to $1.8B); est. 50M+ consumer MPC wallet users (inferred from Coinbase 108M users × ~50% MPC adoption + ZenGo 1M+ + other providers); est. 5,000 institutional traders using MPC wallets (market sizing from major trading firms); est. 15+ MPC wallet providers (Fireblocks, ZenGo, Coinbase, BitGo, Binance, Web3Auth, Lit Protocol, Privy, Dynamic, Portal, Magic, Turnkey, Qredo, Anchorage, Copper); $800K-$2M budget (3-4 researchers × 9 months × $200K + 4-6 engineers × $150K + 2-3 ML engineers × $180K + compliance × 2 × $140K + $200K infrastructure); <30% institutional providers can demonstrate transaction verification (inferred from regulatory pressure and stated adoption challenges).
     - **Uncertainties**: Actual blind signing loss percentage unknown (estimated 80% from theft patterns but no definitive attribution); Optimal verification latency unclear (is <1s achievable? or fundamental trade-off between speed and accuracy?); False positive tolerance unknown (will users accept 1% legitimate transactions blocked? 0.1%?); Regulatory compliance details TBD (EU MiCA technical requirements not fully specified until Q2 2025); ML model accuracy ceiling unknown (can 99.9% true positive rate be achieved? or fundamental limit at 95-99%?); User behavior unknown (will users actually read verification warnings? or click through like current warnings?).

## Glossary

- **Approval scam**: Attack requesting ERC-20 token approval (allowance) for unlimited or excessive amounts, enabling attacker to drain tokens later without additional user interaction.
- **Behavioral analysis**: Technique analyzing historical contract behavior, transaction patterns, and interaction chains to detect malicious activity beyond signature-based matching.
- **Blind signing**: Approving cryptographic signatures without understanding the semantic meaning or consequences of the transaction being signed.
- **Data field**: Transaction parameter containing smart contract function call encoded as bytecode; users typically see truncated hex (0x742d35A3...) without semantic interpretation.
- **Drainer contract**: Malicious smart contract that appears benign in initial interaction but enables recursive withdrawals or approval scams in subsequent transactions.
- **ERC-20 allowance**: Token approval mechanism allowing third-party contracts to transfer tokens on user's behalf; vulnerable to unlimited approval attacks (2^256-1).
- **EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)**: European Union regulatory framework requiring crypto custody providers implement transaction verification by Q3 2025.
- **False positive rate**: Percentage of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as malicious; <1% critical for user experience (blocking valid transactions damages trust).
- **Phishing simulation**: Attack presenting fake transaction preview UI matching benign operation while submitting different malicious payload to blockchain.
- **SEC custody rule 206(4)-2**: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requirement that custody providers maintain "reasonable assurances" client transactions match instructions.
- **Semantic transaction decoding**: Translating raw transaction bytecode into human-readable description (e.g., "0x095ea7b3..." → "Approve unlimited USDC to 0x742d...35A3").
- **Transaction simulation**: Executing transaction in isolated environment to predict state changes before blockchain submission; detects some but not all attack patterns.
- **True positive rate**: Percentage of actual malicious transactions correctly detected; ≥95% minimum for effective protection, ≥99% target.
