## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: Institutional users of MPC wallet custody and wallet-as-a-service (WaaS) platforms face systemic counterparty and insolvency risk where a single provider bankruptcy, license revocation, or abrupt shutdown can freeze billions in digital assets, turn customers into unsecured creditors, and leave asset recovery dependent on multi-year court proceedings rather than cryptographic guarantees. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     Third-party MPC custody and WaaS providers centralize critical key shares, policy engines, and transaction orchestration so that a single provider insolvency or operational shutdown can render institutional clients temporarily or permanently unable to move funds, even though MPC is marketed as removing single points of failure. Recent high-profile collapses of centralized platforms (FTX, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi) left customers with billions of dollars in frozen crypto and complex bankruptcy claims [News: Investopedia, 2024; News: CNBC, 2022], while legal analysis shows that commingled customer assets are often treated as property of the estate, making users unsecured creditors rather than beneficial owners [News: CNBC, 2022]. For MPC-based custody, this combines legal counterparty risk with technical availability risk: if the provider-controlled signing share, MPC coordinator, or key backup infrastructure is seized, shut down, or mismanaged, clients may lose timely control of on-chain assets even when keys are cryptographically split.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Crypto custody risk extends beyond hacking to include counterparty and insolvency scenarios where the custodian’s financial distress, fraud, or mismanagement leads to client assets being frozen, re-hypothecated, or lost [Article: Vaultody, 2025]. Vaultody highlights four enterprise custody risk categories—security threats, operational & human error, counterparty & insolvency risk, and regulatory & compliance risk—with counterparty & insolvency risk explicitly noting that a custodian’s insolvency can freeze assets and that even segregated accounts have been mishandled [Article: Vaultody, 2025]. Safeheron describes how third-party crypto custody providers offer insurance and regulatory compliance but still expose users to fraud or insolvency risk and single points of failure if not using rigorous multisig or MPC [Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. CNBC emphasizes that, unlike bank deposits (FDIC up to $250K) or broker accounts (SIPC up to $500K), there is no equivalent investor protection scheme for crypto exchange or custody failures, and users may find that pooled customer assets are treated as property of the failed exchange in bankruptcy, with Mt. Gox creditors still waiting to recover billions of dollars a decade after its 2014 collapse [News: CNBC, 2022]. The FTX collapse in 2022, driven by misappropriation of customer deposits and commingling of funds, triggered billions in investor losses and a broader “crypto contagion” that pushed multiple lenders into bankruptcy [News: Investopedia, 2024]. At the same time, Safeheron reports that hackers stole over $2.2B in crypto in 2024, often exploiting centralized custody or weak internal controls [Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. For MPC-based custodians, legal and operational frameworks have not kept pace with cryptographic advances: many institutional deployments rely on a provider-operated key share and coordination service, proprietary backup procedures, and ToS that do not clearly guarantee asset segregation, independent recovery paths, or customer-controlled failover if the provider becomes insolvent, loses licenses, or experiences long-term outages [Article: PwC, 2023; Article: Vaultody, 2025].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Custody continuity: Ensure that institutional clients can regain independent control over ≥95% (min) / ≥99% (target) / 100% (ideal) of on-chain assets held through MPC custody within 7 days of a provider insolvency or permanent service shutdown (baseline: many centralized failures left customers with effectively 0% immediate access and multi-year recovery timelines [News: CNBC, 2022; News: Investopedia, 2024]). Recovery time objective (RTO): Reduce RTO for full portfolio migration from a failed MPC provider to an alternate custodian or self-hosted MPC stack from months/years (baseline: exchange bankruptcies and operational collapses requiring lengthy court processes) to <30 days (min) / <7 days (target) / <48 hours (ideal) for technical and legal transition. Legal segregation: Achieve clear legal classification of MPC-custodied assets as segregated client property (not estate property) in at least 3 major jurisdictions (US, EU, UK) by Q4 2026, validated by independent legal opinions and reflected in custody agreements for ≥90% of AUM (baseline: many current ToS allow commingling and treat users as unsecured creditors [News: CNBC, 2022]). Architecture resilience: Design MPC architectures such that no single commercial provider, legal entity, or cloud region controls a quorum of signing shares for ≥95% of institutional AUM by Q2 2026 (baseline: many deployments rely on provider-operated co-signing shares and proprietary coordinators [Article: Vaultody, 2025; Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]). Risk reduction: Decrease the estimated portion of institutional AUM that would be fully frozen for >30 days in a major provider failure from ~50% (min) / ~70% (likely) [Assumption, inferred from centralized exchange failures and current custodial concentration] to <10% (min) / <5% (target) / <1% (ideal) by Q4 2026.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025–Q4 2026 (24 months) to redesign custody contracts, adjust MPC architectures, and test emergency migration procedures across multiple jurisdictions. Budget: Large MPC custodians may need to allocate $2M–$5M over 2 years for legal restructuring, business continuity planning (BCP), technical redundancy, and customer migration tooling; smaller providers may have only $500K–$1M available [Assumption, based on typical enterprise legal and infrastructure program costs]. Regulatory constraints: Crypto custody is regulated differently across the US, EU, UK, Singapore, and Switzerland, with evolving requirements on client asset segregation, capital reserves, and disclosure; any continuity solution must comply with local custody rules and insolvency regimes [Article: PwC, 2023; Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. Operational limitations: Many institutional clients lack the infrastructure, security teams, or willingness to self-host MPC co-signers or run independent key-share nodes, constraining designs that require clients to operate hardware or HSMs in multiple regions. Business model constraints: MPC providers rely on lock-in via proprietary policy engines, key management backends, and cloud infrastructure; exposing standardized export/migration pathways and distributing control may conflict with short-term revenue incentives. Technology dependencies: Achieving continuity often requires multi-cloud deployment, hardware security modules or secure enclaves, cross-provider key-share portability, standardized backup formats, and robust audit trails [Article: Vaultody, 2025]; these introduce complexity and potential new failure modes. Legal uncertainty: Insolvency courts may treat MPC key shares, backups, and transaction metadata as part of the provider’s estate absent explicit trust structures or client-asset segregation mechanisms [Article: PwC, 2023].
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     Institutional Clients (hedge funds, asset managers, corporates, exchanges) rely on MPC custody for treasury, trading, and client assets; they need assured asset continuity (≥99% of assets movable within 7 days of provider failure) and clear segregation of client property, but are constrained by limited internal security teams and regulatory obligations to use “qualified custodians.” MPC Wallet Providers and WaaS Platforms (Fireblocks-like services, custodial MPC vendors, infrastructure providers) architect and operate key-share infrastructure and policy engines; they need sustainable business models and compliance across jurisdictions, but may resist designs that reduce lock-in or increase portability. Regulators and Supervisors (SEC, CFTC, EU regulators, UK FCA, MAS) define custody, segregation, and capital rules; they need assurance that client assets are protected even in insolvency, with clear legal frameworks for MPC custody, but operate under political and legislative constraints and limited technical MPC expertise. Insolvency Practitioners, Trustees, and Courts manage failed custodians, interpret ToS, and decide whether pooled assets are estate property or segregated; they need clear legal structures and documentation to prioritize customer claims but currently must adapt traditional insolvency frameworks to novel MPC models [Article: PwC, 2023]. Cloud and Infrastructure Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, HSM vendors) host MPC key shares and backends; they must provide robust availability and failover, but also support data access for migration while complying with court orders and data protection laws. Insurance Carriers and Auditors (crypto custody insurers, SOC 2 auditors) influence acceptable continuity standards; they require standardized controls and evidence of robust BCP/DRP before underwriting or providing clean audit opinions [Article: PwC, 2023].
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025–Q4 2026 for design, legal restructuring, implementation, and testing of continuity plans, with ongoing refinement beyond 2026 as regulations and case law evolve. Systems: MPC key generation and signing protocols, custody account models (omnibus vs. segregated on-chain accounts), policy engines and approval workflows, backup and recovery systems, legal trust structures, custody agreements and ToS, business continuity and disaster recovery processes, and regulatory reporting pipelines [Article: PwC, 2023; Article: Vaultody, 2025]. Scale: Dozens of MPC custody providers and WaaS platforms, hundreds of institutional clients, and an estimated tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in crypto assets custodied via MPC architectures [Assumption, extrapolated from major custodians’ AUM and institutional adoption trends]. Geographic scope: Major custody hubs in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific (US, EU, UK, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong), each with distinct insolvency and client asset protection regimes. Impact: In a worst-case insolvency of a large MPC provider, a single failure could freeze access to client assets across multiple exchanges, DeFi integrations, and corporate treasuries, triggering liquidity crises, missed obligations, and reputational damage comparable to or exceeding prior centralized exchange collapses [News: Investopedia, 2024; News: CNBC, 2022].
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     Centralized custody and exchange failures (Mt. Gox 2014, FTX 2022, Celsius and Voyager 2022) highlighted that customers can become unsecured creditors with frozen funds for years, pushing regulators and market participants to demand better segregation, proof-of-reserves, and governance [News: CNBC, 2022; News: Investopedia, 2024]. Some custody providers have responded by using segregated on-chain accounts, regular audits, and explicit statements about client-asset ownership, but legal outcomes in insolvency still depend heavily on contract language and jurisdiction. Vaultody promotes enterprise-grade controls including split-key MPC hosted across client and provider, multi-cloud MPC architectures, robust business continuity and recovery plans, and granular role-based access control to reduce custody and insolvency risk [Article: Vaultody, 2025]. Safeheron advocates for combining cold storage, multisig/MPC, insurance, and segregated wallets to protect client assets even if the provider faces financial trouble [Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. Some MPC vendors enable customers to run self-hosted co-signers or on-premise key-share nodes so that the provider alone cannot block signing, but these patterns are not yet industry standard and may not fully address legal classification of assets in insolvency. A few jurisdictions have begun clarifying crypto custody rules and client asset protection, but there is still limited case law directly addressing MPC custody, and most continuity assurances rely on internal policies rather than externally enforceable structures [Article: PwC, 2023].
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: Custody risk includes security threats, operational & human error, counterparty & insolvency risk, and regulatory & compliance risk; a custodian’s insolvency or mismanagement can result in assets being frozen or lost, even when segregated accounts exist [Article: Vaultody, 2025]. Third-party crypto custody providers expose users to fraud and insolvency risk, and single points of failure persist if not using robust multisig or MPC with proper operational design [Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. In 2024 hackers stole over $2.2B in crypto assets, with many incidents involving centralized platforms and weak internal controls [Web Search: Safeheron, 2024]. There is no FDIC/SIPC-style guarantee for crypto exchange or custody failures; pooled customer assets may be treated as property of the estate in bankruptcy, leaving users as unsecured creditors [News: CNBC, 2022]. Mt. Gox creditors have waited years to recover billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency since its 2014 collapse [News: CNBC, 2022]. The FTX collapse involved misappropriation and commingling of customer funds and led to billions in investor losses and a regulatory crackdown [News: Investopedia, 2024]. PwC highlights that crypto custody providers must ensure availability, confidentiality, and integrity of private keys and backups across the key lifecycle, and that loss of key availability or integrity can make digital assets irrecoverable [Article: PwC, 2023].
     - **Assumptions**: Tens of MPC custody and WaaS providers collectively secure tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in institutional digital assets (extrapolated from major custody AUM disclosures and institutional adoption of MPC); a large provider failure could freeze a substantial share (e.g., >20–30%) of institutional on-chain liquidity if independent migration paths are not in place. Current ToS and custody agreements for many MPC-based services likely treat client assets in ways similar to centralized exchanges, where commingling and omnibus accounts blur ownership, leaving users as unsecured creditors in insolvency absent explicit trust or segregation structures. Typical large providers would need to invest $2M–$5M over 2 years to redesign MPC architectures, legal frameworks, and BCP/DRP to support robust continuity, while smaller providers face proportionally high fixed costs. Baseline exposure is that a majority of institutional AUM held via MPC could be effectively frozen >30 days in the event of a provider insolvency today, due to lack of standardized migration tooling, operational rehearsals, and legal clarity; this is inferred from historical centralized failures and current concentration of custody.
     - **Uncertainties**: Exact global AUM held via MPC custody and the percentage concentrated in the top providers are not publicly disclosed; estimates rely on partial disclosures and industry reports. The legal treatment of MPC key shares, backups, and associated infrastructure in insolvency proceedings varies by jurisdiction and has limited precedent; future case law could strengthen or weaken client asset protections. The extent to which emerging regulations (e.g., MiCA in the EU, evolving US custody rules) will explicitly address MPC custody structures, segregation, and continuity requirements remains unclear. It is uncertain how many institutional clients are willing or able to operate self-hosted MPC co-signers or independent key-share nodes at scale. The long-term willingness of providers to embrace open standards for key-share portability, cross-provider recovery protocols, and shared continuity testing is unknown, as these may reduce competitive lock-in. The systemic impact of a major MPC provider failure on overall market liquidity, DeFi protocols, and institutional confidence is difficult to quantify in advance.

## Glossary

- **Counterparty & insolvency risk**: The risk that a custodian, exchange, or wallet provider becomes insolvent or otherwise fails, causing client assets to be frozen, re-hypothecated, or treated as property of the estate rather than segregated client property.
- **Custody risk**: Combined risk that digital assets become inaccessible or are lost due to theft, fraud, mismanagement, operational failure, or provider insolvency, even when cryptographic controls like MPC are in place.
- **MPC (Multi-Party Computation) custody**: A custody model where private keys are replaced by cryptographic key shares distributed across multiple parties or devices, so that no single entity holds the full key, but signing requires a threshold subset of participants.
- **Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS)**: Hosted wallet infrastructure provided as an API or platform, often including MPC key management, policy engines, and transaction orchestration operated by a third-party provider for institutional clients.
- **Segregated client assets**: Legal and operational structure where client assets are held separately from the provider’s own assets and are intended to remain the client’s property, even in insolvency; effectiveness depends on contract language and jurisdiction.
- **Unsecured creditor**: A creditor without collateral or specific security interest in particular assets, whose claims in insolvency rank behind secured creditors and may recover only a fraction of the owed amount.
- **Business continuity plan (BCP)**: Formal plan defining how an organization maintains essential operations during and after disruptive events (e.g., provider insolvency, data center failure), including failover, communication, and recovery procedures.
- **Disaster recovery (DR)**: Technical subset of continuity focused on restoring systems, data, and infrastructure after a major incident, often with specific recovery time and recovery point objectives.
- **Omnibus account**: Custody structure where multiple clients’ assets are pooled in shared addresses or accounts, simplifying operations but making individual ownership and segregation less explicit in insolvency.
- **Proof-of-reserves**: Technique for demonstrating that a custodian holds sufficient on-chain assets to match client liabilities, typically using cryptographic proofs and/or third-party audits.
- **Key availability**: The ability to access and use cryptographic keys or shares when needed; loss of availability (e.g., due to provider shutdown or corrupted backups) can make assets effectively irrecoverable even without a security breach.
