**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security Architecture Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallets market themselves as eliminating single points of failure through distributed key architecture, but widespread use of identical vendor-supplied software across all parties reintroduces centralized vulnerability where single software compromise, malicious update, or implementation flaw affects entire wallet ecosystem serving est. 100M+ users and $50B+ assets. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC protocols distribute cryptographic key shares across multiple independent parties to eliminate single points of failure, but practical implementations typically deploy identical software from single vendor across all parties (client-side, server-side, mobile app all developed by same company), creating de facto single point of failure where vendor compromise affects entire system. Critical vulnerabilities: (1) Software supply chain attacks (malicious code injection into vendor repository affects all deployments) [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; (2) Implementation bugs (protocol errors, cryptographic mistakes materialize complete private keys despite theoretical security) [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; (3) Malicious updates (compromised vendor pushes backdoored version to all parties simultaneously) [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; (4) Performance shortcuts (vendors sacrifice security for <3s transaction latency demanded by users, including disabling expensive zero-knowledge proofs, using "honest-but-curious" MPC variants vulnerable to single malicious party) [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Industry impact: major MPC implementations affected by vendor-specific vulnerabilities (Lindell17, GG18/20 protocols deployed identically by Fireblocks, ZenGo, Coinbase serving 100M+ users) [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023], 10-second signature latencies unacceptable (traders disable MPC to achieve <1s latency) [Blog: Cubist, 2024], $2.2B crypto theft in 2024 with MPC key security bypassed by transaction-level attacks [Report: Chainalysis, 2025]. Resolution requires software diversity (different implementations of same protocol), formal verification (machine-checked correctness proofs), and realistic performance expectations balancing security vs. latency.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     MPC theoretical security assumes adversary can compromise <threshold parties (e.g., 2-of-3 scheme secure if adversary controls ≤1 party) [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. However, practical deployments violate this assumption through software homogeneity: user's mobile app, wallet provider's server infrastructure, co-signer services all execute identical codebase from single vendor [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Example architecture: ZenGo mobile app (vendor-supplied) + ZenGo server (vendor-supplied) + AWS KMS (generic but vendor-configured) = single vendor controls entire software stack [implied from MPC wallet architectures]. Cubist security team analysis: "If all parties use identical software from same vendor, or if vendor itself is compromised, security benefits of MPC can be undermined... many legitimate implementations take something like ten seconds to produce signature. Ten second latencies aren't something that traders, gamers, or really anyone who's used normal web will put up with; we've talked to traders who use popular MPC wallets with MPC turned off" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Software supply chain risk acute: single compromised developer account, malicious dependency, or CI/CD pipeline breach affects all deployments globally [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Implementation complexity creates vulnerability: "MPC protocols and their implementations have been broken before—and they will be again and again—until we can prove them correct. Current approach to proving protocols correct means tens of pages of dense, hand-checked, buggy math; eliminating bugs in these proofs by machine checking them requires new research innovations; formally verifying protocol implementations will require more than pinch of divine inspiration" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Performance pressure drives security shortcuts: "Many real MPC systems fail to meet their theoretical promise because they sacrifice security for performance... MPC wallets need heavyweight crypto and network traffic, so many legitimate implementations take something like ten seconds to produce signature" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Historical vulnerabilities: Multiple MPC wallet providers (ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, Binance, BitGo, ING Bank) deployed identical vulnerable Lindell17 and GG18/20 implementations enabling key extraction through 16-256 malicious signing requests [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]. Root cause: vendors optimize for developer convenience (single SDK deployed everywhere) and time-to-market (reuse code across client and server) rather than security diversity [implied from Cubist analysis]. Industry lacks diversity: 15+ MPC wallet providers but most license protocols from same research papers (Lindell17, GG18/20, CGGMP20) and implement nearly identical codebases [implied from vulnerability disclosure patterns].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Software diversity: Achieve ≥2 independent implementations of same MPC protocol per deployment (e.g., client uses Implementation A, server uses Implementation B) across ≥50% of production deployments by Q4 2026 (current: <5% use diverse implementations). Vendor independence: Reduce single-vendor-controlled deployments from ≥90% (current: most wallets vendor-supplies all party software) → ≤30% by Q4 2026 (measured by codebase provenance across MPC parties). Formal verification: Achieve machine-checked correctness proofs for ≥50% of production MPC protocol implementations by Q4 2027 (current: <5% have formal verification, mostly hand-checked math). Vulnerability detection: Reduce time-to-detection for implementation bugs from 2-5 years (current: Lindell17/GG18/20 vulnerabilities deployed 2018, discovered 2023) → <6 months through continuous security audits (≥2 independent audits per year per major implementation). Performance transparency: Require public disclosure of signature latency benchmarks (p50, p95, p99) and security trade-offs for ≥80% of MPC wallets by Q2 2026 (current: most vendors obscure performance vs. security compromises). Security vs. performance: Establish industry consensus on acceptable latency ranges: <1s (ideal) / <3s (acceptable) / <10s (secure implementations with full cryptography) vs. current hidden trade-offs where vendors sacrifice security for <1s latency without user awareness. Supply chain security: Achieve ≥90% of vendors implementing software supply chain security (signed commits, CI/CD attestations, dependency verification, reproducible builds) by Q4 2026 (current: <30% estimated).
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025 - Q4 2027 (30 months for software diversity + formal verification research + industry adoption); Budget: $5M-$15M industry-wide for independent implementations (2-3 teams × $2M-$5M per protocol implementation) + $3M-$8M for formal verification research (academic collaboration + verification tool development) + $1M-$3M per vendor for supply chain security infrastructure; Team: Per independent implementation: 4-6 cryptography engineers (specializing in MPC protocols) + 2-3 security auditors + 1-2 formal verification specialists; Academic collaboration required (UC Berkeley, MIT, Stanford cryptography research groups for formal verification innovations); Technology: Formal verification tools (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, F* for protocol proofs), software supply chain security (Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA framework for build attestations), diverse programming languages (Rust, Go, TypeScript implementations of same protocol to reduce common-mode failures), continuous integration with security scanning (static analysis, fuzzing, symbolic execution); Compatibility: Independent implementations must interoperate (same MPC protocol specification with different codebases), backward compatibility with existing deployed keys (cannot force key rotation for software diversity); Performance: Diverse implementations must meet latency requirements (<10s max, <3s target) without sacrificing security, may require protocol optimization research; Adoption barriers: Vendors resist software diversity (increases development cost 2-3×, complicates support and debugging, backward compatibility challenges), users demand low latency (<1s for trading) creating pressure for security shortcuts, formal verification requires specialized expertise (limited talent pool, 10-20 experts globally capable of verifying MPC protocols).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     MPC Wallet Vendors (15+ companies: Fireblocks, ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, BitGo, need competitive differentiation through security, constraint: software diversity increases development cost 2-3× + complicates support); End Users - Institutional Traders (est. 5,000+ professional traders, need <1s transaction latency for high-frequency strategies, constraint: unwilling to accept 10s latency for security); End Users - Custody Clients (pension funds, family offices managing $50B+ assets, need verifiable security guarantees, constraint: lack technical expertise to evaluate implementation quality); Security Researchers (academic cryptography community + security audit firms, need reproducible formal verification, constraint: formal verification tools immature for complex MPC protocols); Open Source Community (developers building alternative implementations, need protocol specifications + interoperability testing, constraint: MPC complexity creates high barrier to entry, limited contributors); Regulators (financial authorities, need assurance of custody security, constraint: lack technical capability to evaluate MPC implementation quality); Software Supply Chain Security Vendors (Sigstore, GitHub, need adoption of attestation frameworks, constraint: crypto industry slow to adopt enterprise security practices); Auditors (10+ specialized security firms auditing MPC wallets, need consistent verification standards, constraint: audits cost $50K-$200K per protocol implementation, limited budgets).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2025 - Q4 2027 (30 months for diversity + verification + adoption); Systems: MPC protocol implementations (Lindell17, GG18/20, CGGMP20, FROST, others), client software (mobile apps, browser extensions, desktop applications), server infrastructure (key management services, co-signing servers), software supply chain (repositories, CI/CD pipelines, dependency management), formal verification tools (theorem provers, symbolic execution engines); Current impact: ≥90% deployments use single-vendor software across all parties (de facto single point of failure), 2-5 year vulnerability detection time (Lindell17/GG18/20), unknown percentage sacrifice security for performance (<1s latency achieved by disabling expensive cryptography), $2.2B crypto theft in 2024 includes MPC implementations bypassed; Scale: 15+ MPC wallet vendors, 100M+ end users, est. $50B+ assets under custody, thousands of institutional deployments; Risk: Vendor compromise affects entire ecosystem (all users simultaneously vulnerable), malicious update pushed to all parties (coordinated key theft), implementation bugs materialize complete private keys (despite theoretical security), performance shortcuts discovered post-deployment (users unknowingly using insecure configurations); Use cases: Consumer wallets, institutional custody, exchange hot wallets, DeFi protocol key management, enterprise treasury operations; Regions: Global (software homogeneity affects worldwide deployments), highest risk in jurisdictions with sophisticated attackers (nation-state adversaries targeting concentrated cryptocurrency holdings).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2018-2020: First-generation MPC wallets (ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, Unbound Security) deployed Lindell17 and GG18/20 protocols, prioritized time-to-market over software diversity, single vendor supplied all party implementations [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]. 2020: CGGMP20 protocol published with enhanced security proofs, but similar deployment pattern (single vendor implements all parties) [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]. 2021-2022: Performance pressure led some providers to use "honest-but-curious" MPC variants (assume parties follow protocol, broken by single deviation) for <3s latency, creating vulnerability [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. 2023: Fireblocks security research discovered key extraction vulnerabilities in widely-deployed Lindell17 and GG18/20 implementations affecting ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, Binance, BitGo, ING Bank [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]. Key lesson: Identical implementations across ecosystem created correlated vulnerability (all providers simultaneously affected). Post-disclosure fixes deployed Q3-Q4 2023 adding zero-knowledge proofs, but still single-vendor implementations [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]. 2024: Cubist team published critique of MPC marketing claims highlighting software homogeneity risk: "If all parties use identical software from same vendor... security benefits of MPC can be undermined" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Some vendors began exploring formal verification (Fireblocks partnered with academic teams), but machine-checked proofs not yet achieved [implied from Cubist analysis of verification challenges]. Key lesson: Formal verification requires new research innovations (current hand-checked proofs contain bugs), implementation verification even harder. Limited progress on software diversity: economic incentives favor single-vendor approach (lower cost, faster development, easier support), no market pressure for diversity until major incident occurs [implied from current market state].
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: MPC theoretical security assumes adversary compromises <threshold parties [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; Practical deployments use identical vendor-supplied software across all parties [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; "Ten second" signature latencies typical for secure implementations with full cryptography [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; Traders disable MPC or use insecure configurations for <1s latency [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; Multiple major providers (ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, Binance, BitGo, ING Bank) deployed identical vulnerable Lindell17/GG18/20 implementations [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]; Vulnerabilities deployed 2018, discovered 2023 (2-5 year detection time) [Paper: Fireblocks, 2023]; Current formal verification relies on hand-checked math with bugs [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; Machine-checked verification requires new research innovations [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; $2.2B crypto theft in 2024 [Report: Chainalysis, 2025].
     - **Assumptions**: ≥90% deployments use single-vendor software (inferred from Cubist analysis and market practices); <5% use diverse implementations (inferred from lack of public diverse deployments); <5% have formal verification (inferred from Cubist statement about verification challenges); <30% implement software supply chain security (estimated from enterprise security practices in crypto industry); est. 100M+ users affected (major provider market share: Coinbase 108M users, extrapolated to ecosystem); est. $50B+ assets under custody (institutional custody AUM across major providers); Software diversity increases development cost 2-3× (estimated from need for 2-3 independent teams implementing same protocol); $5M-$15M industry-wide for independent implementations (2-3 protocols × 2 implementations each × $2M-$5M per team); $3M-$8M formal verification research (academic collaboration + tool development over 30 months); $50K-$200K per audit (standard security audit pricing for protocol implementations); 10-20 experts globally capable of verifying MPC protocols (estimated from specialized formal verification skillset); 2-5 year vulnerability detection time (based on Lindell17/GG18/20 timeline 2018-2023).
     - **Uncertainties**: Actual percentage of deployments using single-vendor software unknown (proprietary architecture information); How many vendors sacrifice security for performance? What specific shortcuts taken?; Actual signature latency distribution across implementations unknown (vendors don't disclose p50/p95/p99); What latency can be achieved with full security? Is <3s possible or fundamental trade-off?; Feasibility of machine-checked formal verification for MPC protocols unclear (major research challenge, timeline uncertain); Cost-benefit of software diversity unclear (how much security improvement? worth 2-3× development cost?); Will users accept 10s latency for full security? Or market force continued shortcuts?; Supply chain attack probability unknown (how likely vendor compromise?); Interoperability complexity for diverse implementations unclear (same protocol spec but different code—will they work together?); Adoption timeline uncertain (will vendors voluntarily adopt diversity + verification? or require major incident forcing change?); Regulatory pressure potential unclear (will regulators mandate formal verification or software diversity?).

## Glossary

- **CGGMP20**: UC Non-Interactive, Proactive, Threshold ECDSA protocol by Canetti, Gennaro, Goldfeder, Makriyannis, Peled (2020) with enhanced zero-knowledge proofs; widely deployed MPC protocol.
- **Common-mode failure**: Vulnerability affecting multiple systems simultaneously due to shared components (identical software); defeats redundancy by creating correlated failures.
- **Formal verification**: Mathematical proof of software correctness using machine-checked theorem provers (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, F*); eliminates implementation bugs but requires specialized expertise.
- **GG18/GG20**: Threshold ECDSA protocols by Gennaro and Goldfeder (2018, 2020) enabling multi-party signing; vulnerable implementations deployed 2018, vulnerabilities discovered 2023.
- **Honest-but-curious**: Security model assuming parties follow protocol specification (honest) but may observe internal data (curious); broken by any party deviating from protocol.
- **Implementation bug**: Software error distinct from protocol design; MPC complexity (zero-knowledge proofs, network coordination) creates high bug probability.
- **Lindell17**: Two-party ECDSA protocol by Yehuda Lindell (2017) used for 2-of-2 threshold signatures; vulnerable implementations enabled key extraction via 256 test messages.
- **Performance vs. security trade-off**: Tension between <3s transaction latency demanded by users and 10s+ latency required for secure MPC implementations with full cryptography.
- **Signature latency**: Time from transaction initiation to signed output; secure MPC implementations typically 10s, users demand <3s, some vendors achieve <1s by sacrificing security.
- **Software supply chain attack**: Compromise of development infrastructure (repositories, CI/CD pipelines, dependencies) to inject malicious code; affects all deployments using compromised vendor.
- **Vendor-supplied software**: Code developed and distributed by single company across all MPC parties (client, server, co-signers); creates single point of failure despite distributed keys.
- **Zero-knowledge proof**: Cryptographic proof allowing one party to prove correctness without revealing secrets; required for secure MPC but computationally expensive (increases latency).
