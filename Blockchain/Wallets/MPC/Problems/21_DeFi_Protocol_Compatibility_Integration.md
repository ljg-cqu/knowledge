**Owner**: DeFi Integration & Product Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[Important]** Q: MPC wallet users and institutional DeFi participants face significant compatibility barriers accessing decentralized finance protocols (staking, lending, yield farming, liquidity provision) due to smart contract assumptions of single-signer EOA wallets, 2-15 second MPC signing latency incompatible with time-sensitive DeFi operations, gas optimization challenges where multi-round threshold signatures require additional on-chain verification, and limited support for complex DeFi transaction flows (flash loans, multi-step composable operations, MEV protection) requiring $300K-$1M integration investment per major MPC provider to build DeFi connectivity infrastructure. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets' distributed architecture creates friction accessing $100B+ DeFi ecosystem (Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Curve, Lido staking) [Web Search: DeFi Integration, 2024]. Key barriers: (1) Smart contract assumptions where DeFi protocols designed for EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets with instant signing (<1s), fail to handle MPC's 2-15s latency causing transaction timeouts, slippage errors, and failed approvals [Web Search: DeFi Integration, 2024]; (2) Gas inefficiency where MPC generates standard ECDSA signatures indistinguishable from EOA (blockchain compatibility), but distributed coordination overhead and potential batching requirements increase transaction costs 10-30% vs. direct EOA usage [estimated]; (3) Time-sensitive operations where liquidations, flash loans, arbitrage, and MEV-sensitive swaps require sub-second execution, incompatible with MPC's multi-round protocols (4-9 rounds × 200-500ms per round = 2-5s minimum latency) [Web Search: Stackup, 2025]; (4) Multi-step transaction flows where DeFi composability (approve token → deposit collateral → borrow → swap → provide liquidity in single transaction sequence) requires coordinating 5-10 MPC signatures, adding 10-150s total latency making complex strategies impractical [estimated]; (5) Limited protocol support where 1,000+ DeFi protocols each have custom integration requirements (Aave lending parameters, Uniswap pool interactions, Curve staking mechanics), requiring MPC wallets build protocol-specific adapters at $50K-$200K per integration [estimated]; (6) Custody model mismatches where some DeFi protocols (Compound governance, Aave credit delegation) assume single key holder with immediate signing authority, breaking with MPC's distributed approval requirements (2-of-3, 3-of-5 signers must coordinate) [Web Search: DeFi Integration, 2024]. Affects 50M+ crypto users, 10K+ institutional DeFi participants, $300K-$1M integration costs per major MPC provider, limiting MPC wallet users to basic DeFi operations (simple swaps, basic staking) while missing advanced strategies (leveraged positions, yield farming, liquidity provision).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     DeFi ecosystem scale: $100B+ Total Value Locked (TVL) across 1,000+ protocols on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche [DeFi Llama, 2024]. Major protocols: Aave ($20B+ TVL, lending/borrowing), Uniswap ($10B+ TVL, decentralized exchange), Lido ($30B+ TVL, liquid staking), Curve ($5B+ TVL, stablecoin swaps), MakerDAO ($8B+ TVL, CDP stablecoin), Compound ($3B+ TVL, lending) [estimated 2024 figures]. Traditional DeFi users: EOA wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger) with instant transaction signing (<1s local ECDSA), enabling rapid DeFi interactions (approve ERC-20 → stake in 2 transactions × 1s = 2s total) [industry standard]. Smart contract assumptions: DeFi protocols designed 2018-2020 when EOA wallets dominated (>95% market share), assuming (1) Instant signing (transaction submitted to mempool <1s after user approval); (2) Single signer (no coordination delay); (3) Predictable gas costs (standard ECDSA signature verification ~21K gas) [Ethereum yellow paper]. MPC wallet DeFi friction: (1) Latency incompatibility where 2-15s MPC signing causes: transaction pool expiration (many DeFi UIs timeout after 30s, MPC multi-step flows exceed limit), price slippage (market moves during 15s signing, causing "slippage tolerance exceeded" errors), failed approvals (ERC-20 approval transaction pending while DeFi protocol expects immediate deposit, sequencing breaks) [Web Search: DeFi Integration, 2024]; (2) Time-sensitive operations incompatible: liquidations (Aave, Compound require immediate execution when collateral ratio breaches threshold, 15s delay allows others to front-run), flash loans (borrow-use-repay in single block, MPC coordination crosses multiple blocks), arbitrage (price discrepancies close within seconds, MPC latency misses opportunities), MEV protection (Flashbots bundles require specific block inclusion, MPC signing delay shifts to later block) [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]; (3) Multi-step flows impractical: yield farming strategy (approve token → deposit collateral → borrow stablecoin → swap to another token → provide liquidity to pool → stake LP tokens = 6 transactions × 5s MPC = 30s, during which prices shift, nonces misalign, reverts occur) [estimated]; (4) Gas overhead: batching multiple MPC signatures for efficiency requires complex transaction bundling (EIP-4337 account abstraction, smart contract wallets), adding 50K-100K gas (~$5-$10 at 100 gwei, 10-30% overhead vs. direct EOA) [estimated from EIP-4337 costs]; (5) Protocol-specific challenges: Compound governance (voting requires immediate signature, 3-of-5 MPC coordination delays vote until proposal period closes), Aave credit delegation (delegator signs off-chain message granting credit line, requires synchronous multi-party approval conflicting with real-time borrower needs), Uniswap V4 hooks (custom logic triggered during swaps, assumes instant signature verification) [Web Search: DeFi Integration, 2024]; (6) Integration costs: each DeFi protocol requires custom MPC wallet adapter (encode parameters, handle protocol-specific errors, optimize signing flows), costing $50K-$200K per protocol × 20 major protocols = $1M-$4M per MPC provider [estimated]. Current state: MPC wallets support basic DeFi (Uniswap swaps, simple Aave deposits) but struggle with advanced features (leveraged positions, flash loans, MEV strategies, governance participation); institutional DeFi participants (market makers, liquidity providers, treasury management) using MPC wallets report operational challenges and fall back to EOA wallets or custodial solutions sacrificing distributed security for DeFi access [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Protocol coverage: Achieve native integration with ≥20 major DeFi protocols (Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Lido, MakerDAO, Compound, Balancer, SushiSwap, Yearn, Convex, Rocket Pool, Frax, GMX, Pendle, Eigenlayer, Ethena, Morpho, Spark, Instadapp, DeFi Saver) by Q4 2026. Transaction latency: Reduce end-to-end DeFi transaction time from 2-15s (current MPC signing) → <3s (min) / <2s (target) / <1s (ideal) through optimistic signing, pre-signatures, and protocol-specific optimizations by Q3 2026. Multi-step flow efficiency: Enable complex DeFi strategies (approve → deposit → borrow → swap → provide liquidity = 5-6 steps) in <15s total (vs. 30-90s current sequential MPC signing) through transaction batching, parallel signing, and EIP-4337 account abstraction by Q4 2026. Gas cost parity: Achieve gas costs within 10% of EOA baseline (currently 10-30% overhead from batching, account abstraction) through protocol optimizations and signature aggregation by Q3 2026. Time-sensitive operation support: Enable flash loan execution (<1 block time = 12s Ethereum), liquidation participation (respond within 5s of trigger), MEV protection (Flashbots bundle inclusion) through predictive pre-signing and optimistic execution by Q4 2026. User adoption: Increase MPC wallet users actively participating in DeFi from est. <10% (currently limited to basic swaps/staking) → ≥50% (accessing full DeFi functionality including lending, liquidity provision, yield farming) by Q4 2027. Institutional integration: Achieve ≥50 institutional DeFi participants (market makers, funds, DAOs, treasuries) deploying MPC wallets for DeFi operations without sacrificing security for operational efficiency by Q4 2027. Developer experience: Reduce integration effort for MPC wallet providers from $300K-$1M (current custom per-protocol adapters) → <$50K (standardized DeFi connectivity layer with pre-built protocol integrations) by Q2 2026. Slippage tolerance: Maintain DeFi transaction success rate ≥95% (currently 80-90% due to slippage from MPC latency) by reducing signing time and implementing price monitoring with automatic resubmission by Q3 2026.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months: DeFi connectivity layer architecture Q1-Q2 2026, protocol integrations Q2-Q4 2026, optimization Q1-Q3 2027, institutional adoption Q2-Q4 2027); Budget: $3M-$8M per major MPC provider (DeFi connectivity layer $1M-$2M, protocol integrations $50K-$200K × 20 protocols = $1M-$4M, gas optimizations $500K-$1M, developer tools $500K-$1M, operations $500K-$1M); Team: Per provider requires 8-15 blockchain engineers (protocol integration specialists, smart contract developers, gas optimization experts), 3-5 backend engineers (transaction coordination, signing optimizations), 2-3 product managers (DeFi roadmap, institutional requirements), 3-5 DevOps (infrastructure scaling, monitoring), 2-3 security researchers (DeFi-specific attack vectors, MEV front-running protection); Technology constraints: MPC signing latency fundamentally 2-15s (cannot eliminate cryptographic computation + network rounds), must optimize through pre-signing, optimistic execution, and protocol-specific shortcuts; Gas costs inherently higher for account abstraction (EIP-4337 adds 50K-100K gas), tradeoff between security (distributed signing) and efficiency (direct EOA); Flash loans require single-block execution (12s Ethereum, 2s Polygon), limiting MPC protocols to fastest implementations (CGGMP20 4-round ~2-4s vs. GG18 9-round ~10-15s); MEV protection (Flashbots, MEV-Boost) requires predictable block inclusion, but MPC signing variability (2-15s range) complicates bundle construction; Multi-step transaction coordination requires nonce management (sequential transaction ordering), but DeFi composability assumes single atomic operation (one transaction calling multiple protocols), EIP-4337 account abstraction enables batching but adds complexity; Smart contract wallet approach (Safe/Gnosis multisig) provides DeFi compatibility but sacrifices MPC's off-chain privacy (threshold coordination visible on-chain, higher gas costs 100K-200K per transaction); Protocol-specific limitations: some DeFi protocols hardcode assumptions (Compound governance 1 vote per address requires single signer, Aave credit delegation expects synchronous approval, Uniswap V4 hooks may not support delayed signing); Network congestion: during high gas periods (>500 gwei), MPC latency combines with mempool delays causing 5-15 minute transaction confirmation, unacceptable for DeFi; Backward compatibility: optimizations must support existing MPC deployments (cannot require users re-generate keys or migrate to new protocols).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     MPC Wallet Users - Retail DeFi (est. 5M users seeking yield farming, staking, liquidity provision, need <3s transaction times for reasonable UX, constraint: unwilling to sacrifice security for DeFi access, frustrated by current limitations); MPC Wallet Users - Institutional DeFi (est. 10K market makers, liquidity providers, DAO treasuries, need full DeFi functionality including flash loans, leveraged positions, MEV strategies, constraint: currently forced to choose between MPC security or EOA operational efficiency) [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]; MPC Wallet Providers (10+ vendors: Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase WaaS, ZenGo, Fordefi, need DeFi integration to compete with EOA wallets, constraint: $300K-$1M integration costs per provider, 24-month development timeline) [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]; DeFi Protocol Developers (1,000+ protocols, need MPC wallet user access to increase TVL and user base, constraint: cannot break EOA compatibility for 95% of current users, integration changes must be backward compatible); DeFi Front-ends (Aave UI, Uniswap Interface, Curve Interface, Zapper, Zerion, need MPC wallet support for institutional user adoption, constraint: current UIs assume <1s signing, require redesign for MPC latency tolerance); Liquidity Providers (5,000+ professionals providing $50B+ TVL across DeFi, need MPC security for large positions while maintaining operational efficiency, constraint: rebalancing strategies require frequent transactions, MPC latency compounds across operations); Market Makers (100+ institutional firms, need MPC for custody security while accessing DeFi liquidity, constraint: arbitrage opportunities require millisecond execution, MPC latency unacceptable for HFT strategies) [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]; DAO Treasury Managers (500+ DAOs managing $10B+ in treasuries, need MPC multi-party approval for governance compliance while deploying funds in DeFi yield strategies, constraint: coordination overhead compounds when accessing DeFi, operational friction limits treasury optimization); Yield Aggregators (Yearn, Convex, Beefy, need MPC wallet integration to serve institutional clients, constraint: automated strategies require rapid rebalancing, MPC signing delays break automation); Flash Loan Developers (arbitrageurs, liquidators using Aave Flash Loans, dYdX, need single-block execution incompatible with MPC latency, constraint: flash loan reverts if not repaid in same block, MPC coordination exceeds block time); MEV Searchers (extracting maximal extractable value, need Flashbots bundle inclusion requiring predictable timing, constraint: MPC signing variability (2-15s) prevents precise bundle construction); Gas Optimization Services (Blocknative, Flashbots, need MPC transaction patterns for mempool analysis, constraint: batched MPC transactions differ from standard EOA patterns, require specialized handling); Smart Contract Auditors (reviewing DeFi protocol security, need to understand MPC wallet interaction patterns, constraint: novel attack vectors from delayed signing, multi-party coordination).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months: architecture/standardization Q1-Q2 2026, protocol integrations Q2-Q4 2026, optimization Q1-Q3 2027, production adoption Q2-Q4 2027); Systems affected: DeFi connectivity layer (protocol adapters, transaction encoding, error handling, retry logic), Transaction coordination (batching, parallel signing, nonce management, mempool monitoring), Gas optimization (signature aggregation, EIP-4337 account abstraction, smart contract wallet integration), Pre-signing infrastructure (predictive signature generation for time-sensitive operations, key-value caching), Optimistic execution (submit transactions before signature completion, update with final signature), MEV protection (Flashbots integration, bundle construction accounting for MPC latency), Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BSC), Protocol-specific integrations (Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Lido × 20+ major protocols), Developer SDKs (simplified DeFi integration APIs for dApps), Monitoring & analytics (track DeFi transaction success rates, gas costs, latency impact); Current state: MPC wallets support basic DeFi (Uniswap swaps, simple Aave deposits achieving 80-90% success rate due to slippage), limited institutional adoption (<10% of DeFi users use MPC wallets estimated), advanced operations impractical (flash loans fail due to latency, leveraged positions timeout, MEV strategies incompatible), $300K-$1M integration cost per provider limits protocol coverage to 5-10 major protocols, 2-15s signing latency causes 10-20% transaction failures from slippage/timeout, gas overhead 10-30% from batching inefficiencies; Scale: 50M+ crypto users accessing DeFi (potential MPC wallet audience), 10K+ institutional DeFi participants requiring secure custody + operational efficiency, $100B+ DeFi TVL across 1,000+ protocols, 20 major protocols requiring prioritized integration (80% of DeFi activity), 10+ MPC wallet providers needing DeFi connectivity, 5,000+ liquidity providers, 100+ market makers, 500+ DAO treasuries, millions of DeFi transactions daily; Use cases: Retail DeFi (yield farming, staking, swapping), Institutional DeFi (market making, liquidity provision, treasury management), DAO operations (multi-party approved DeFi strategies, governance participation), Automated strategies (yield aggregators, rebalancing bots accessing DeFi), Leveraged positions (borrowing to amplify returns), Flash loan operations (arbitrage, liquidations), MEV extraction (searcher strategies, builder operations); Impact if successful: 50M+ crypto users access DeFi with MPC security (vs. <5M current estimated), $50B+ institutional capital deployed in DeFi with distributed custody (vs. risky EOA or custodial solutions), MPC wallets achieve feature parity with EOA (removing adoption blocker), DeFi protocols gain institutional user segment (increasing TVL, legitimacy), 80% reduction in integration costs enables long-tail protocol support; Impact if unsuccessful: MPC wallets remain limited to basic DeFi operations, institutional participants forced to choose between security (MPC) or functionality (EOA), $50B+ institutional capital stays out of DeFi due to custody concerns, MPC wallet market growth constrained by DeFi incompatibility (missing $100B+ ecosystem).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2018-2020: Early DeFi protocols (Uniswap V1/V2, Aave V1, Compound V2) designed for EOA wallets dominating >95% market share [DeFi early history]. Smart contracts assumed instant signing, single signer, predictable gas; no consideration for MPC's multi-party coordination or threshold latency. 2020-2022: First-generation MPC wallets (Fireblocks, Unbound, ZenGo) focused on custody and payments; DeFi integration deprioritized due to complexity [product focus]. Users wanting DeFi access used EOA wallets sacrificing distributed security. 2021-2022: Smart contract wallet adoption (Gnosis Safe, Argent) provided multi-party approval compatible with DeFi but on-chain coordination expensive (100K-200K gas per multisig transaction vs. 21K EOA) and visible (threshold logic transparent on-chain vs. MPC's off-chain privacy) [Web Search: Stackup, 2025]. Market remained 90%+ EOA dominated. 2022-2023: MPC wallet providers began basic DeFi integrations: Fireblocks supported Uniswap swaps, Aave deposits [product announcements], ZenGo added staking for major tokens [consumer wallet features]. Limitations: only simple operations (1-2 transaction flows), no flash loans, no leveraged positions, no MEV protection, 10-20% failure rate from slippage caused by MPC latency [estimated from user reports]. 2023-2024: Fordefi emerged as specialized institutional MPC wallet for DeFi, building "full DeFi connectivity for market makers and asset managers" [Web Search: Fordefi, 2023]. Approach: (1) Protocol-specific optimizations (custom adapters for 20+ major protocols); (2) Transaction batching (coordinate multiple DeFi steps in parallel where possible); (3) Slippage management (monitor prices during signing, auto-resubmit if slippage exceeded); (4) MEV protection (integrate with Flashbots accounting for MPC latency); (5) Institutional focus (serving market makers requiring rapid DeFi access with MPC custody). Results: demonstrated MPC-DeFi viability for sophisticated users but required $1M+ R&D investment, limited to single vendor (not ecosystem-wide solution), primarily served institutional segment (retail users still underserved). 2024-2025: EIP-4337 account abstraction mainnet deployment enabled transaction batching (bundle approve + deposit + borrow in single UserOperation), reducing multi-step latency from 5 × 5s = 25s (sequential) to single batched operation ~5-8s [EIP-4337 specification]. Trade-off: added gas costs 50K-100K (10-30% overhead). deBridge (cross-chain liquidity protocol) chose Fordefi MPC wallet API to scale operations [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]. Optimistic execution explored: submit transaction to mempool during MPC signing (before complete), update with final signature, reducing perceived latency from 5s to <1s for user [research concept, limited production deployment]. Pre-signing adoption: generate signatures in advance for predictable operations (e.g., staking to known addresses), reducing signing latency to <100ms at transaction time [Web Search: Fireblocks, 2024]; limitation: requires predicting transaction parameters (not applicable to market-responsive swaps, liquidations). Key lesson: MPC-DeFi integration technically feasible but requires significant engineering investment ($300K-$1M per provider), protocol-specific optimizations (no universal solution), and acceptance of trade-offs (gas overhead, latency optimizations with security implications, operational complexity); ecosystem-wide success requires standardized DeFi connectivity layer, pre-built protocol integrations, and continued protocol evolution (EIP-4337, signature aggregation, account abstraction advancements).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: DeFi protocols designed for EOA wallets with instant signing [industry standard 2018-2020]; MPC wallets offer strong DeFi compatibility, with integrations allowing secure access to various DeFi services and multi-chain support [Web Search: Debut Infotech, 2024]; MPC wallets can be integrated with DeFi protocols for staking, lending, yield farming, providing secure participation [Web Search: Debut Infotech, 2024]; Fordefi built full DeFi connectivity for market makers and asset managers with institutional MPC wallet [Web Search: Fordefi, 2023]; deBridge chose Fordefi MPC wallet API to scale cross-chain liquidity [Web Search: Fordefi, 2024]; CGGMP20 achieves 4-round signing (more efficient than GG18's 9 rounds, critical for DeFi latency reduction) [Web Search: Stackup, 2025]; EIP-4337 account abstraction enables transaction batching but adds 50K-100K gas overhead [Ethereum specifications]; Smart contract wallets (Gnosis Safe) compatible with DeFi but 100K-200K gas per transaction vs. 21K EOA [Web Search: Stackup, 2025]; Flash loans require single-block execution (12s Ethereum, 2s Polygon) [protocol specifications]; Ethereum block time ~12s [network parameters].
     - **Assumptions**: $100B+ DeFi TVL across 1,000+ protocols (extrapolated from DeFi Llama aggregated data, Aave $20B, Lido $30B, Uniswap $10B, others); 50M+ crypto users access DeFi (inferred from DeFi protocol user counts, MetaMask 30M+ MAU, broader crypto user base); 10K+ institutional DeFi participants (market makers, funds, treasuries, estimated from professional DeFi segment); <10% MPC wallet users actively participate in DeFi currently (inferred from limited protocol support, operational challenges reported); $300K-$1M integration cost per major MPC provider (protocol integrations $50K-$200K × 20 protocols + connectivity layer $1M-$2M + operations); 2-15s MPC signing latency (CGGMP20 4-round ~2-4s optimistic, GG18 9-round ~10-15s pessimistic, network variability); 10-30% gas overhead from batching, account abstraction (EIP-4337 adds 50K-100K gas, ~10-30% increase over 21K base); 80-90% DeFi transaction success rate with MPC (10-20% failures from slippage, timeout, sequencing errors estimated from user reports); 5,000+ professional liquidity providers, 100+ market makers, 500+ DAO treasuries (sized from institutional DeFi segment); Multi-step DeFi flows require 5-10 signatures (approve, deposit, borrow, swap, provide liquidity, stake = 6 steps typical); Pre-signing reduces latency to <100ms for predictable operations [Web Search: Fireblocks, 2024]; 95% success rate achievable with optimizations (reducing slippage failures through price monitoring, automatic resubmission).
     - **Uncertainties**: What percentage of MPC wallet users actually want DeFi access? (Institutional segment clearly demands it, consumer segment unclear); Can optimistic execution be made secure? (Submit transaction before final signature, update later; what attack vectors exist?); Will EIP-4337 account abstraction achieve mainstream adoption? (Gas overhead 10-30% may limit appeal; alternative solutions?); Can pre-signing scale beyond predictable operations? (Staking, known addresses work; market-responsive swaps, liquidations require real-time parameters); What is optimal latency target for DeFi operations? (Is <3s sufficient or <1s required to match EOA UX expectations?); Will DeFi protocols evolve to support delayed signing? (Could protocols add "pending approval" states allowing MPC coordination? Or backward compatibility constraint prevents changes?); Can flash loans ever work with MPC? (Single-block requirement fundamental; can optimistic execution or protocol changes enable compatibility?); What is acceptable gas cost overhead? (10-30% premium for MPC security; will users pay? Or price sensitive?); How many protocols must be integrated for sufficient DeFi coverage? (20 major protocols = 80% activity; or need 100+ for long-tail access?); Will standardized DeFi connectivity layer achieve industry adoption? (Requires MPC wallet provider collaboration; competitive dynamics may limit sharing); Can MEV protection work with variable MPC latency? (Flashbots bundles require precise block inclusion; 2-15s signing range complicates); What percentage of institutional capital will move to DeFi with secure MPC? (Custody concerns currently block $50B+; if solved, how much flows in?); Will regulatory clarity enable or restrict institutional DeFi via MPC? (MiCA, SEC guidance pending; outcome uncertain).

## Glossary

- **Account abstraction (EIP-4337)**: Ethereum improvement proposal enabling smart contract wallets with custom validation logic; allows transaction batching (multiple operations in single UserOperation) reducing MPC multi-step latency but adds 50K-100K gas overhead.
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Blockchain-based financial services (lending, borrowing, trading, staking) without intermediaries; $100B+ TVL across 1,000+ protocols, primarily designed for EOA wallets with instant signing.
- **EOA (Externally Owned Account)**: Traditional Ethereum wallet with single private key; instant signing (<1s), simple recovery via seed phrase, 100% funds loss if key compromised; dominates DeFi usage >90% of transactions.
- **Flash loan**: DeFi primitive borrowing assets without collateral if repaid in same transaction/block; enables arbitrage, liquidations, leveraged strategies; requires <12s execution (Ethereum block time) incompatible with MPC 2-15s latency.
- **Gas overhead**: Additional computational cost in blockchain transactions; MPC wallets using account abstraction incur 50K-100K extra gas (~10-30% premium over 21K base EOA transaction) for batching and coordination.
- **Liquidation**: DeFi mechanism closing under-collateralized positions; requires immediate execution when collateral ratio breaches threshold; time-sensitive (seconds matter) conflicting with MPC multi-round coordination delays.
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**: Profit extracted by reordering, including, or censoring transactions within blocks; searchers use Flashbots for bundle inclusion requiring predictable timing, complicated by MPC signing variability (2-15s).
- **Multi-step transaction flow**: DeFi strategy requiring sequential operations (approve token → deposit collateral → borrow → swap → provide liquidity = 5-6 transactions); MPC signing each step sequentially adds 10-90s total latency causing slippage, timeout failures.
- **Optimistic execution**: Technique submitting transaction to mempool during MPC signing (before complete signature), updating with final signature upon completion; reduces perceived latency from 5s to <1s but introduces security considerations.
- **Pre-signing**: MPC optimization generating signatures in advance for predictable operations (staking to known addresses), reducing signing latency from 2-15s to <100ms at transaction time; limited to operations with known parameters.
- **Slippage**: Price change between transaction submission and execution; MPC's 2-15s latency allows market movement causing "slippage tolerance exceeded" errors, currently 10-20% transaction failure rate for time-sensitive DeFi operations.
- **Smart contract wallet**: Wallet implemented as blockchain smart contract (Gnosis Safe, Argent) enabling custom logic (multisig, social recovery); DeFi-compatible but 100K-200K gas per transaction vs. 21K EOA, and on-chain transparency vs. MPC off-chain privacy.
- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Dollar value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols; aggregate metric measuring DeFi ecosystem size, currently $100B+ across major protocols (Aave $20B, Lido $30B, Uniswap $10B).
- **Yield farming**: DeFi strategy maximizing returns by providing liquidity across protocols, claiming rewards, and compounding; requires frequent rebalancing (multiple transactions daily), operational friction multiplied by MPC latency.
