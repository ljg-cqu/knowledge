# Centralized Coordination Infrastructure Creating Single Point of Failure in MPC Wallets

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Infrastructure & Security Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallets marketed as "decentralized" and "trustless" critically depend on centralized vendor-controlled coordination servers (Firebase, AWS, SQS) to relay messages between distributed key share holders, creating single point of failure where server downtime, DDoS attacks, or government censorship blocks all transactions globally, undermining core value proposition and affecting est. 100M+ users managing $50B+ assets. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets distribute private key shares across multiple parties to eliminate single points of failure, but practical implementations rely on centralized vendor-hosted "coordination servers" (Firebase Cloud Messaging, Amazon SQS, vendor APIs) to relay multi-round protocol messages between participants during key generation and transaction signing [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. This architectural dependency creates operational vulnerability where server unavailability blocks all wallet operations: (1) AWS outage October 2025 affected Coinbase, Robinhood, Polygon, Arbitrum making wallets temporarily unusable [News: CoinCentral, 2025]; (2) Vendor API downtime prevents transaction signing even though users hold key shares [Incident: Portal, 2024]; (3) Government censorship or sanctions enable transaction blocking at coordination layer despite distributed cryptographic control [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]; (4) DDoS attacks targeting coordination servers disrupt entire user base simultaneously [Risk: single attack vector affects all users]; (5) Vendor business failure (bankruptcy, acquisition, shutdown) permanently locks user funds if coordination layer disappears [Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024]. Resolution requires decentralized communication infrastructure (peer-to-peer relay networks like Waku, libp2p) eliminating vendor dependency, offline signing capabilities enabling direct party-to-party coordination, and redundant multi-vendor relay architecture providing failover resilience.
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     MPC protocols require multiple communication rounds for distributed key generation (DKG) and threshold signing: participants exchange commitment values, zero-knowledge proofs, signature shares over network [Guide: Stackup, 2024]. User devices (mobile phones, browser extensions) cannot maintain always-on peer-to-peer connections (NAT traversal, battery constraints, intermittent connectivity) necessitating relay servers for message passing [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Current architecture: vendor operates centralized coordination servers (cloud-hosted APIs, message queues, WebSocket endpoints) facilitating MPC handshake; user's client connects to vendor server, server routes messages to other parties, coordination layer orchestrates multi-round protocol execution [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Specific implementations: Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications + server-side message relay (common in consumer MPC wallets), Amazon SQS or similar message queues for institutional custody (high-throughput transaction signing), vendor proprietary APIs for key management services [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Industry reliance on AWS infrastructure: October 2025 AWS US-EAST-1 region DNS resolution failure caused widespread crypto platform outages including Coinbase, Robinhood, Layer-2 networks (Polygon, Arbitrum), demonstrating centralization risk "despite claims of decentralization" [News: CoinCentral, 2025; News: Rekt, 2025]. Silence Labs analysis: "Although convenient, this centralised approach raises privacy and business continuity concerns and introduces a trusted central authority, i.e., a single point of control or DOS vector" [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Real incident: Portal Web3 Infrastructure experienced "Enclave MPC API Backup + Recover Degradation" affecting backup and recovery functions when vendor API endpoints unavailable [Incident: Portal, 2024]. Critical contradiction: MPC wallets marketed as "eliminating single points of failure through distributed key architecture" while actual deployments depend on single vendor infrastructure for operational availability [Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024]. Market evolution: first-generation MPC wallets (2018-2023) prioritized time-to-market, deployed centralized coordination as simplest architecture; emerging second-generation solutions (Silence Labs + Waku integration 2023, Lit Protocol decentralized key management 2024) exploring peer-to-peer communication but limited production adoption [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023; Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Operational independence: Enable users to sign transactions when vendor coordination server offline → ≥99% signing success rate during vendor outages by Q4 2026 (current: 0% success when server unavailable, users completely blocked). Decentralized relay adoption: Achieve ≥50% of MPC wallet providers supporting peer-to-peer coordination (Waku, libp2p, Nostr) as primary or backup communication layer by Q4 2027 (current: <5% use decentralized relay, ≥95% depend on centralized servers). Censorship resistance: Eliminate single-party transaction blocking capability → 0 vendor-initiated transaction censorship events by Q4 2026 (measured by inability of coordination server to selectively block transactions). Vendor redundancy: Reduce single-vendor infrastructure dependency from ≥90% (current: most wallets use single cloud provider for coordination) → ≤20% by Q4 2027 through multi-vendor relay architecture (AWS + GCP + Azure + peer-to-peer fallback). Uptime resilience: Achieve ≥99.99% wallet availability (≤53min downtime/year) independent of vendor infrastructure by Q4 2027 (current: correlated downtime with vendor infrastructure, e.g., AWS region outages cause wallet outages). DDoS resistance: Enable transaction signing during coordination layer DDoS attacks → ≥95% transaction success rate during attacks by Q4 2026 (current: coordination server DDoS blocks all users globally). Business continuity: Ensure wallet operability if vendor business fails → 100% user asset recovery capability without vendor cooperation by Q4 2026 (current: vendor shutdown may permanently lock funds if coordination layer disappears). Market transparency: Require ≥80% of MPC wallet providers to publicly disclose coordination architecture (centralized vs. decentralized, vendor dependencies, uptime SLAs) by Q2 2026 (current: opaque architectures, users unaware of centralization risks).
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for peer-to-peer protocol integration + multi-vendor architecture deployment + industry adoption); Budget: $2M-$6M per major provider ($1M-$2M decentralized relay integration + $500K-$1.5M multi-vendor redundancy + $500K-$1.5M offline signing capabilities + $500K-$1M testing and migration), $10M-$30M industry-wide for 10-15 providers; Team: Per provider implementation: 4-6 protocol engineers (peer-to-peer networking, MPC protocol adaptation), 2-3 infrastructure architects (multi-region redundancy, failover logic), 2-3 mobile developers (offline signing capabilities, peer discovery on client devices), 1-2 security auditors (attack surface review, censorship resistance verification); Technology: Peer-to-peer relay networks (Waku libp2p-based censorship-resistant communication, Nostr decentralized message relay, IPFS for distributed data availability), WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections (NAT traversal, browser-to-browser communication), offline signing architecture (local MPC protocol execution when coordination server unavailable, direct peer discovery via Bluetooth, local network, QR codes), multi-cloud deployment (AWS + GCP + Azure + Cloudflare for relay redundancy, DNS-based failover), backward compatibility (existing centralized coordination as fallback for legacy clients, gradual migration path); User experience constraints: Peer-to-peer discovery adds latency (1-5s connection establishment vs. instant with centralized server), offline signing UX complex (requires manual peer coordination, limited transaction throughput), battery drain on mobile devices (maintaining peer-to-peer connections vs. lightweight centralized relay); Network constraints: Peer-to-peer protocols increase bandwidth consumption (direct connections + relay gossip overhead), NAT traversal not always successful (corporate firewalls, restrictive networks may block peer-to-peer, fallback to centralized relay required); Security requirements: Peer-to-peer communication must maintain MPC protocol security (end-to-end encryption, authentication of peer identities, resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks on relay layer), decentralized relay must not enable censorship by distributed adversaries (Sybil resistance, relay node reputation systems); Adoption barriers: Vendors resist decentralization (increases complexity 3-5×, harder to debug and support, operational costs higher for multi-vendor infrastructure), users demand instant transactions (peer-to-peer latency 1-5s vs. <500ms centralized relay), regulatory pressure for transaction monitoring (coordination layer provides enforcement chokepoint, decentralization complicates AML/KYT compliance).
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     End Users - Consumer (est. 30M+ using MPC wallets for daily transactions, need 100% uptime for payments and trading, constraint: intolerant of coordination server downtime blocking access to funds); End Users - Institutional (pension funds, family offices managing $50B+ assets, need business continuity guarantees independent of vendor viability, constraint: cannot accept single-vendor dependency for fiduciary compliance); MPC Wallet Providers (15+ companies: Fireblocks, ZenGo, Coinbase WaaS, BitGo, Web3Auth, need competitive differentiation through censorship resistance and uptime, constraint: decentralization increases development and operational costs 3-5×); Cloud Infrastructure Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Microsoft hosting coordination servers, need to maintain service reliability but face inherent regional outage risks, constraint: cannot guarantee 100% uptime, October 2025 AWS outage demonstrated systemic risk); Decentralized Communication Protocols (Waku, Nostr, IPFS developing censorship-resistant relay networks, need MPC wallet adoption to prove utility, constraint: peer-to-peer protocols currently 1-5s slower than centralized servers, limited production maturity); Regulators (financial authorities, need transaction monitoring capabilities for AML/KYT enforcement, constraint: decentralized coordination eliminates central enforcement chokepoint, complicating compliance); Censorship Targets (users in jurisdictions with capital controls or sanctions, need censorship-resistant transactions, constraint: centralized coordination enables government blocking, vendor compliance with censorship requests); DeFi Protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Curve integrating MPC custody, need reliable transaction execution, constraint: coordination server downtime disrupts protocol operations, arbitrage bots, liquidations); Developers (500+ integrating MPC wallets into applications, need predictable uptime and latency SLAs, constraint: centralized coordination SLAs typically 99.9% but correlated failures affect multiple providers simultaneously during cloud outages); Security Researchers (academic and industry experts, need to evaluate coordination layer attack surface, constraint: centralized architecture creates single DDoS target, peer-to-peer increases complexity of security analysis).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for decentralized relay integration + multi-vendor redundancy + industry adoption); Systems: MPC coordination servers (vendor APIs, message queues, WebSocket endpoints), peer-to-peer relay networks (Waku, Nostr, libp2p), client software (mobile apps, browser extensions, desktop applications supporting peer discovery), multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS + GCP + Azure + edge networks for relay redundancy), offline signing capabilities (local peer-to-peer coordination, Bluetooth/QR code-based message exchange); Current impact: ≥95% of MPC wallets depend on centralized vendor coordination (single point of failure), 100% service disruption when coordination server unavailable (e.g., AWS outage October 2025 affected major platforms), 0% censorship resistance (vendor can block transactions at coordination layer), unknown DDoS resilience (coordination servers vulnerable to availability attacks); Scale: 15+ MPC wallet providers, est. 100M+ users globally, $50B+ assets under custody, 1000+ DeFi protocol integrations, critical infrastructure for crypto payments, trading, institutional custody; Historical incidents: AWS US-EAST-1 outage October 2025 (DNS resolution failure, Coinbase, Robinhood, Polygon, Arbitrum affected) [News: CoinCentral, 2025; News: Rekt, 2025]; Portal MPC API degradation impacting backup and recovery [Incident: Portal, 2024]; Cloudflare outages periodically affecting crypto platforms; Multiple exchange API downtimes during high-volatility periods (coordination layer bottleneck); Risk: Permanent fund loss if vendor shuts down without migration path (coordination layer disappears, users cannot sign despite holding key shares), government censorship blocking transactions (sanctions, capital controls enforced at coordination server), DDoS attacks disrupting global user base simultaneously (single attack vector affects millions), competitive disadvantage vs. true decentralized alternatives (users migrate to non-custodial wallets without vendor dependency); Use cases: Consumer crypto payments (need instant transaction confirmation, downtime unacceptable), institutional custody (need 99.99% uptime SLAs, business continuity guarantees), DeFi protocol operations (arbitrage, liquidations time-sensitive, coordination delays cause MEV loss), cross-border remittances (censorship resistance critical in capital control jurisdictions), NFT marketplaces (transaction finality important for bidding, auction mechanics); Regions: Global (coordination centralization affects all users worldwide), highest impact in jurisdictions with internet censorship (China, Russia, Iran where government can block vendor servers), capital control regions (Argentina, Nigeria, Turkey where transaction censorship risk high), areas with unreliable internet infrastructure (coordination server downtime more frequent).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2018-2022: First-generation MPC wallets (Fireblocks, ZenGo, Unbound Security, Coinbase WaaS) deployed centralized coordination servers as pragmatic architecture prioritizing time-to-market and user experience (instant connections, low latency, simple client implementation) [Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024]. Typical architecture: vendor-hosted cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP), Firebase Cloud Messaging for consumer wallets, proprietary REST APIs and WebSocket endpoints for key management services. 2023: Silence Laboratories partnered with Waku to integrate decentralized communication into MPC-TSS SDKs, enabling "fully decentralised MPC Threshold Signature Scheme" without reliance on centralized servers [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Key innovation: peer-to-peer relay replacing Firebase, Amazon SQS for message exchange during signing ceremonies, eliminating "trusted central authority" and "single point of control or DOS vector" [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]. Outcome: Preliminary benchmarking showed "promising results" for key generation and signature latency, but production adoption limited (complexity, UX trade-offs). 2024: Multiple decentralized MPC infrastructure protocols emerged: Lit Protocol (decentralized key management network), dWallet (noncollusive MPC with permissionless node network), Passport Protocol by 0xPass (decentralized coordination for EVM chains), ARPA Network (permissionless threshold signatures), ICP threshold ECDSA (Internet Computer Protocol) [Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024]. Architecture pattern: distribute coordination function across permissionless validator network, eliminate single vendor control, provide censorship resistance. Adoption challenges: EVM-only support (limited blockchain coverage), peer-to-peer latency 1-5s (vs. <500ms centralized), increased operational complexity, regulatory concerns (decentralized coordination eliminates AML/KYT enforcement chokepoint). October 2025: AWS US-EAST-1 DNS resolution failure caused widespread crypto platform outages including major custody providers, Layer-2 networks, exchanges, exposing systemic centralization risk "despite claims of decentralization" [News: CoinCentral, 2025; News: Rekt, 2025]. Industry response: increased awareness of vendor concentration risk, some providers began multi-cloud deployments (AWS + GCP redundancy), but fundamental coordination centralization persists. Portal incident: "Enclave MPC API Backup + Recover Degradation" demonstrated vendor API unavailability affecting critical wallet functions [Incident: Portal, 2024]. Key lesson: Coordination layer reliability directly impacts wallet availability; centralized architecture creates correlated failures across user base; redundancy within single provider insufficient (AWS multi-region still fails during systemic events). Limited progress on decentralization: <5% of MPC wallets deploy peer-to-peer coordination in production (Waku integration mostly experimental), ≥95% continue centralized vendor servers (easier to build, better UX, lower operational costs), market pressure favors instant transactions over censorship resistance [inferred from current adoption patterns].
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: MPC protocols require multi-round communication between parties [Guide: Stackup, 2024]; User devices cannot maintain always-on peer-to-peer connections (NAT, battery, intermittent connectivity constraints) [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]; Centralized coordination servers introduce "single point of control or DOS vector" [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]; AWS outage October 2025 affected Coinbase, Robinhood, Polygon, Arbitrum due to infrastructure centralization [News: CoinCentral, 2025; News: Rekt, 2025]; Portal experienced MPC API degradation impacting backup and recovery [Incident: Portal, 2024]; Silence Labs + Waku integration (2023) demonstrated decentralized MPC-TSS without centralized servers [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]; Firebase, Amazon SQS commonly used for MPC message relay [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023]; Multiple decentralized MPC protocols exist (Lit Protocol, dWallet, ARPA Network, ICP) [Blog: Decentralized MPC, 2024]; Peer-to-peer protocols add 1-5s latency vs. <500ms centralized [inferred from networking overhead]; Government can block transactions at centralized coordination layer [Blog: Silence Labs, 2023].
     - **Assumptions**: ≥95% of MPC wallets use centralized vendor coordination (inferred from Silence Labs analysis of "centralised approach" as dominant pattern and decentralized alternatives <5% adoption); est. 100M+ users affected (major provider market share: Coinbase 108M users, extrapolated to MPC wallet ecosystem); est. $50B+ assets under custody (institutional custody AUM across major MPC providers); 0% signing success during vendor outages (inferred from coordination dependency, users blocked when server unavailable); $2M-$6M per provider for decentralized infrastructure (4-6 engineers × 18 months × $200K salary + peer-to-peer integration + multi-cloud deployment + testing); $10M-$30M industry-wide for 10-15 major providers; Decentralization increases costs 3-5× (inferred from complexity, multi-vendor redundancy, operational overhead vs. single-vendor architecture); Peer-to-peer latency 1-5s (connection establishment + peer discovery + NAT traversal overhead); Centralized relay latency <500ms (direct server connection, optimized infrastructure); 99.9% uptime SLA typical for centralized coordination (standard cloud SLA, but correlated failures during region outages); est. 30M+ consumer users, $50B+ institutional assets (market sizing from MPC wallet adoption and custody AUM).
     - **Uncertainties**: Exact percentage of MPC wallets using centralized coordination unknown (proprietary architectures not publicly disclosed); Will users accept 1-5s peer-to-peer latency vs. <500ms centralized servers? (UX trade-off unclear, varies by use case); Can peer-to-peer protocols achieve <1s latency competitive with centralized coordination? (technical feasibility TBD, requires optimization research); How many providers will voluntarily adopt decentralized relay given 3-5× cost increase? (adoption timeline uncertain, may require major incident forcing change); Will regulators mandate centralized coordination for AML/KYT enforcement? (coordination layer provides transaction monitoring chokepoint, decentralization complicates compliance); DDoS attack probability on centralized coordination servers unknown (no public statistics on targeting frequency or impact); Government censorship enforcement at coordination layer unclear (how often do vendors receive blocking requests? compliance rate?); Offline signing UX viability unknown (can manual peer coordination via Bluetooth/QR codes achieve acceptable user experience for mainstream adoption?); Multi-cloud redundancy effectiveness unclear (does AWS + GCP + Azure eliminate single point of failure or just reduce correlated failure probability?); Peer-to-peer security model unclear (can decentralized relay resist Sybil attacks, censorship by distributed adversaries, man-in-the-middle on relay nodes?); Will vendor business failures cause permanent fund loss? (how many MPC wallet providers will shut down without user migration paths?); Actual user funds at risk from coordination centralization unknown (what percentage of $50B+ custody AUM vulnerable to vendor shutdown scenarios?).

## Glossary

- **Censorship resistance**: Property where no single party can selectively block transactions; centralized coordination servers enable vendor or government to prevent specific users from signing.
- **Coordination server**: Vendor-hosted infrastructure (APIs, message queues, relay servers) facilitating multi-round MPC protocol communication between distributed parties; single point of failure in current architectures.
- **Decentralized relay network**: Peer-to-peer communication infrastructure (Waku, Nostr, libp2p) eliminating vendor control, enabling censorship-resistant message passing for MPC protocols.
- **DNS resolution failure**: AWS US-EAST-1 outage cause (October 2025) where domain name lookups failed, making coordination servers unreachable and blocking wallet operations.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: Attack overwhelming coordination server with traffic, preventing legitimate users from connecting; centralized architecture creates single target affecting all users simultaneously.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Google service commonly used for push notifications and message relay in consumer MPC wallets; centralized infrastructure creating vendor dependency.
- **libp2p**: Modular peer-to-peer networking stack used by IPFS and Waku, enabling direct communication between distributed parties without centralized relay.
- **Multi-cloud deployment**: Redundancy strategy using multiple cloud providers (AWS + GCP + Azure) for failover resilience, reducing but not eliminating single-vendor risk.
- **NAT traversal**: Technique enabling peer-to-peer connections through network address translation (NAT) routers; complexity limits direct device-to-device communication, necessitating relay servers.
- **Nostr**: Decentralized relay protocol for censorship-resistant messaging; potential coordination layer alternative eliminating single-vendor control.
- **Offline signing**: MPC wallet capability to complete signing ceremony without vendor coordination server, using direct peer-to-peer communication (Bluetooth, local network, QR codes).
- **Single point of control**: Centralized coordination server enabling vendor or government to block transactions, censor users, or cause correlated failures affecting entire user base.
- **Vendor concentration risk**: Systemic vulnerability where multiple platforms depend on single infrastructure provider (AWS, GCP), creating correlated failures during outages.
- **Waku**: Censorship-resistant peer-to-peer communication protocol based on libp2p, integrated with Silence Labs for decentralized MPC message relay.
