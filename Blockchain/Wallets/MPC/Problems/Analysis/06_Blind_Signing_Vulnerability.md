# Blind Signing Vulnerability in MPC Wallets – Nine-Aspects Analysis

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security Team

---

## Context Recap

- **Problem title**: Blind signing vulnerability in MPC wallets
- **Current state**:
  - MPC wallets remove single-point private key risk via distributed key shares but still rely on users (or multiple approvers) to sign opaque transaction payloads.
  - Users typically see only `to`, `value`, and truncated `data` fields or simplified labels ("Approve", "Swap"), with no semantic view of actual contract behavior.
  - Attackers exploit this gap with approval scams (unlimited ERC‑20 allowances), drainer contracts, phishing UIs that show fake previews, and malicious DApp integrations. [Source: "MPC Wallet Security in 2025: Solving the Blind Signing Gap", Hypernative, 2025]
  - Existing defenses (address blacklists, basic simulation, generic warnings) fail against fresh attacker addresses and multi-step attack chains. [Source: "MPC Wallet Security in 2025: Solving the Blind Signing Gap", Hypernative, 2025]
- **Pain points**:
  - Estimated ≈$1.8B annual losses from blind signing–style attacks, roughly 80% of ≈$2.2B 2024 crypto theft cited in the problem statement. [Source: Problem Statement summarizing Chainalysis Crypto Crime data, 2025]
  - MPC key security gives false sense of safety; users and institutions assume attacks are solved while transaction-level exploits continue.
  - Regulators (EU MiCA, SEC custody rule 206(4)-2) increasingly expect demonstrable transaction verification and auditability, which many providers cannot yet provide. [Source: EU MiCA overview, ESMA, 2024; SEC custody rule 206(4)-2, U.S. SEC]
- **Goals** (from problem statement):
  - Loss reduction: ≈$1.8B/year → <$500M (min) / <$200M (target) / <$50M (ideal) by Q4 2025.
  - Detection: True positive rate (TPR) ≥95% (min) / 99% (target) / 99.9% (ideal) with false positive rate (FPR) <1% (max) / <0.1% (target).
  - UX: End-to-end verification + signing latency <5s (min) / <3s (target) / <1s (ideal).
  - Compliance: Full MiCA transaction verification coverage and SEC custody rule alignment by Q3–Q4 2025 for institutional providers. [Source: Problem Statement, Security Team, 2025-11-29]
- **Hard constraints**:
  - Timeline: Q1–Q4 2025 (~9 months) for design, implementation, rollout.
  - Budget: ≈$0.8M–$2M for verification engine, behavioral models, and integrations.
  - Backward compatibility with existing MPC signing flows; no protocol changes on chains.
  - UX: Cannot consistently add >3s to approval flow without causing significant abandonment. [Estimate: Based on wallet UX benchmarks and internal experiments, medium confidence]
- **Key facts (from problem statement)**:
  - 99% of attackers reportedly use fresh addresses, making static blacklists ineffective. [Source: Hypernative attack pattern analysis, 2025]
  - Hardware wallets suffer similar blind signing issues due to limited on-device UI. [Source: "Transaction Verification: A Solution to Blind Signing in Hardware Wallets", Blockaid, 2024]
  - Basic simulation misses complex approval scams and multi-step drainer contracts.

## 1. Problem Definition (Aspect 1) – Clarity & Precision

### 1.1 Problem & Contradictions

- **Core contradiction**:
  - **Security layer**: MPC removes single-key theft risk by splitting signing power among multiple parties/devices.
  - **Semantic layer**: All parties still sign opaque payloads they do not understand; the semantic meaning of the transaction is effectively centralized in off-chain UIs or not surfaced at all.
  - Result: "Secure keys, insecure decisions" – attackers bypass key protection and instead trick users into authorizing malicious behaviors.
- **Main conflicts**:
  - **Security vs. usability**: Rich transaction decoding and behavior analysis usually increase latency and cognitive load vs. the market demand for near-instant approvals. [Source: Coinbase UX guidance on blind signing, 2024]
  - **Speed vs. verification depth**: Deep, multi-hop behavioral analysis can be computationally expensive; naive implementations jeopardize latency budgets for trading/institutional flows. [Source: Hypernative architecture overview, 2025]
  - **Regulatory expectations vs. operational reality**: Regulators push for strong verification and audit trails; smaller providers lack expertise and budget for custom engines.
- **Why MPC wallets are particularly exposed**:
  - MPC is often marketed as "institution-grade" security; institutional flows have large notional values and complex DeFi interactions.
  - Multi-party approval can create responsibility diffusion: each signer assumes others validated semantics.
  - Many MPC platforms are infrastructure providers (B2B2C), so trust boundaries span multiple organizations (wallet provider, integrator, custodian, client).

### 1.2 Goals & Conditions

- **Security outcomes**:
  - Reduce blind signing–driven losses by at least 70% within ~12 months of deployment, targeting <$500M/year by Q4 2025 under the problem’s assumptions. [Estimate: Linear reduction from 1.8B → 500M; medium confidence]
  - Achieve ≥95% detection TPR for known attack patterns and ≥90% for novel patterns via behavioral heuristics, subject to monitoring and tuning. [Source: Hypernative claims on behavioral verification efficacy, 2025]
- **Operational/UX outcomes**:
  - Keep median added latency ≤1s and p95 ≤3s across major chains for simulation + verification.
  - Provide human-readable, non-technical explanations for consumer users and detailed evidence/audit views for institutions.
- **Compliance outcomes**:
  - Provide evidence packages for auditors: replayable transaction verification logs, rule/model versions, and exception handling.
  - Map verification controls to MiCA and SEC custody rule requirements with legal sign-off. [Source: MiCA compliance guidance, InnReg, 2025]

### 1.3 Extensibility & Reframing

- **Reframing by attribute**:
  - From "blind signing" to **"semantic mismatch between user intent and on-chain effect"** – broadens scope to include misleading UIs, gasless transactions, and meta-transactions.
  - From "attack detection" to **"transaction understanding + policy enforcement"** – includes allowlisting, portfolio policies, client-specific risk rules.
- **Reframing by structure**:
  - Hard vs. soft controls:
    - Hard: Blocking clearly malicious transactions (e.g., unlimited approvals to known drainer patterns).
    - Soft: High-friction flows (step-up auth, additional explanations) for ambiguous cases.
  - Latent vs. manifest risk:
    - Latent: Excessive approvals that only become losses when exploited months later.
    - Manifest: Immediate asset transfers to scam contracts.
- **Benefit of reframing**:
  - Encourages design of a **general transaction intelligence layer** usable across MPC, EOAs, and hardware wallets, instead of an MPC-only patch.

## 2. Internal Logical Relations (Aspect 2)

### 2.1 Key Elements

- **Actors**:
  - End user / trader / institution approver.
  - MPC wallet service (or custody platform).
  - Transaction verification engine (simulation + behavioral analysis).
  - Smart contracts / DApps being interacted with.
- **Core objects**:
  - Raw transaction payload (`to`, `value`, `data`, `gas`, `chainId`).
  - Semantic decoding (function name, parameters, token amounts, allowance ranges, protocol semantics).
  - Behavioral signals (historical behaviors, downstream calls, call trees, anomaly scores). [Source: Hypernative behavioral model description, 2025]
- **Processes**:
  1. DApp constructs transaction.
  2. Wallet or provider forwards payload to verification engine.
  3. Engine simulates transaction and evaluates behavioral / policy rules.
  4. Engine returns risk classification + explanation.
  5. Approvers review and sign or reject.

### 2.2 Balance & "Degree"

- **Too little verification**:
  - Only superficial checks (non-zero value, known malicious addresses) → high residual risk; attacks remain largely undetected.
- **Too much verification**:
  - Overly strict rules and high FPR (<1% target) can block legitimate activity, frustrate power users, and push them to insecure workarounds (e.g., disable checks, use less secure wallets). [Source: Behavioral economics of security warnings, Sunshine et al., IEEE S&P, 2011]
- **Trade-off dimension examples**:
  - **Latency vs. depth**: Deeper graph analysis vs. real-time decisions.
  - **Explainability vs. complexity**: Complex ML models vs. simple rules with clear rationale.
  - **Centralization vs. decentralization**: Central verification SaaS vs. on-prem engines for sensitive institutions.

### 2.3 Causal Chains (Simplified)

1. **Opaque UX → blind approval → ex-post discovery of loss**:
   - Minimal transaction detail → user misperception → approval of malicious payload → attacker drains assets over time → difficult forensic/audit trail.
2. **Regulatory pressure → rushed control deployments → UX degradation**:
   - Compliance requirements without proper UX design → noisy warnings → habituation → users click through → limited real risk reduction. [Source: Blockaid UX case studies on blind signing, 2024]

## 3. External Connections (Aspect 3)

### 3.1 Stakeholder Interactions

| Stakeholder Type | Role | Goals | Constraints | Conflicts |
|------------------|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Upstream (DApps & protocols) | Construct transactions and surfaces UI | High conversion, minimal friction | Limited control over wallet UX; may resist added warnings | Verification engines may flag aggressive approval patterns as risky |
| Downstream (Custodians, exchanges) | Hold assets, manage withdrawals | Loss prevention, regulatory compliance | Integration cost with external verification engines | May demand stricter controls than consumer wallets prefer |
| Sideline / external (Regulators, auditors, security vendors) | Define / interpret requirements, provide technology | Reduce systemic risk, ensure investor protection | Limited technical detail in rules; avoid over-prescription | Vendors may bias towards their solution; regulators wary of vendor lock-in |

### 3.2 Environment Factors

- **Regulation**:
  - MiCA sets harmonized EU rules for crypto-asset service providers, with explicit focus on custody and safeguarding of client assets. [Source: Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), ESMA, 2024]
  - SEC custody rule 206(4)-2 pushes for "reasonable assurances" that transactions match client instructions, encouraging strong verification and logging. [Source: SEC, Rule 206(4)-2 guidance]
- **Market structure**:
  - Growing institutional adoption of MPC custody increases potential impact of a single verification design flaw.
  - Attack kits and "drainer-as-a-service" lower attacker expertise requirements and accelerate attack evolution. [Source: Halborn "2024 Blockchain Security in Review", 2024]

### 3.3 Responsibility & Room for Others

- **Where MPC wallet provider should take responsibility**:
  - Provide secure defaults: verification enabled for all high-risk operations by default, opt-down rather than opt-in.
  - Maintain and update behavior models, rule sets, and data sources (e.g., known drainer patterns, protocol semantics).
  - Expose APIs/events so institutional clients can build their own downstream policy layers.
- **Where others should retain flexibility**:
  - Institutions may want customized risk tiers, exceptions, and allowlists.
  - Protocol teams may provide machine-readable risk metadata or "safe interaction" templates, but should not be forced into one vendor’s verification stack.

---

## 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

### 4.1 Historical Nodes

1. **Pre-smart-contract era**: Signing mainly transfers; human-readable fields (amount, recipient) were sufficient.
2. **Early smart contracts & hardware wallets (2016–2020)**:
   - Hardware devices limited to small screens and minimal decoding; warnings like "Blind signing – proceed?" were added but widely ignored. [Source: Blockaid, 2024]
3. **DeFi/NFT growth (2020–2022)**:
   - Explosion of contract interactions and token standards; wallets prioritized speed and DApp compatibility over rich verification.
4. **MPC adoption (2021–2024)**:
   - Institutions adopted MPC to meet key protection and redundancy requirements, but reused existing blind signing UX and approval models.

### 4.2 Background vs. Direct Causes

- **Background causes**:
  - UX and device constraints limited semantic decoding and display.
  - Lack of standardized, machine-readable ABI/behavior metadata across protocols.
  - Fragmented threat intelligence; each wallet built its own lightweight rules.
- **Direct triggers**:
  - High-profile drainer incidents and approval scams exploiting unlimited token allowances or deceptive previews.
  - Institutional regulators beginning to question whether "key security" alone is sufficient.

### 4.3 Root Issues

- **Conceptual**: Security discourse framed around key custody and cryptography, not around **transaction intent alignment**.
- **Organizational**: Product teams optimized for growth and onboarding speed; security budgets were allocated to key storage, not transaction understanding.
- **Ecosystem**: Absence of shared, open-source transaction verification frameworks encourages duplicated, incomplete solutions.

---

## 5. Problem Trends (Aspect 5)

### 5.1 Current Trajectory (If Nothing Changes)

- **Attack frequency**: Rising sophistication of drainer kits and social engineering suggests continued or increasing loss volumes. [Source: Halborn, 2024; Chainalysis crypto crime reporting, 2024]
- **Regulatory risk**: Institutions that rely only on MPC without transaction verification may face enforcement or licensing risk under MiCA and SEC rules.
- **User trust**: Repeated high-profile scams on "secure" MPC wallets erode market trust and may push users back to centralized exchanges or custodians.

### 5.2 Early Signals

- Institutional RFPs increasingly mention "transaction verification", "behavioral analysis", and "approval policy" as mandatory checkboxes.
- Security vendors (e.g., Hypernative, Blockaid) marketing transaction verification specifically for blind signing mitigation.
- Major wallets and NFT/DeFi platforms introducing limited approval warnings and simulation UIs.

### 5.3 6–24 Month Scenarios

- **Optimistic**:
  - Widely adopted transaction verification standards; MPC wallets integrate behavioral engines with <1s added latency for most flows.
  - Blind signing losses decline sharply, and regulators treat compliant providers favorably.
- **Baseline**:
  - Leading MPC providers adopt verification; mid/long tail lags due to cost and complexity.
  - Losses decline moderately in institutional segments but remain high in retail and DeFi long tail.
- **Pessimistic**:
  - Fragmented, low-quality implementations; users habituated to warnings; attackers adapt quickly.
  - One or more catastrophic institutional incidents trigger reactive, heavy-handed regulations.

---

## 6. Capability Reserves (Aspect 6)

### 6.1 Existing Strengths

- **Security research**: 3–4 dedicated researchers already tracking attack patterns and analyzing historical incidents.
- **Backend engineering**: 4–6 engineers with experience in multi-chain RPC, high-throughput services, and MPC integrations.
- **ML/data**: 2–3 ML engineers familiar with anomaly detection, sequence modeling, and graph analysis.
- **Compliance**: 1–2 specialists engaged with MiCA/SEC requirements and audits.

### 6.2 Capability Gaps

- **Productized semantics**:
  - Need strong product/UX expertise to translate technical risk into understandable explanations and flows.
- **Continuous intel operations**:
  - Requires 24/7 monitoring, threat intel ingestion, and rapid rule/model updates; many teams are not staffed like security vendors.
- **Explainable ML**:
  - Institutions and regulators require explainability; existing ML skill sets may be oriented toward performance, not interpretability.

### 6.3 Buildable Capabilities (1–6 Months)

- Upskill backend and ML teams on call-graph analysis, symbolic execution, and gas-level simulation.
- Hire or assign a dedicated "transaction security PM" to own UX, risk tiers, and stakeholder communication.
- Establish formal partnerships or data-sharing agreements with threat intel providers or specialized vendors.

## 7. Analysis Outline (Aspect 7)

### 7.1 Structured Outline

1. Context recap and goals (loss reduction, TPR/FPR, latency, compliance).
2. Characterization of blind signing in MPC and related environments.
3. Mapping of stakeholders, regulatory constraints, and threat landscape.
4. Evaluation of design options:
   - A: Minimal checks + better warnings.
   - B: Full behavioral verification engine (build in-house).
   - C: Hybrid model leveraging external vendors.
5. Risk/value assessment and prioritized action plan.
6. Validation, monitoring, and iteration plan.

### 7.2 Key Judgments (Needing Validation)

- 【P0】 Behavioral verification with simulation + historical analysis can achieve ≥95% TPR and ≤1% FPR at <3s added latency for most flows.
- 【P0】 Blind signing losses are concentrated in a small set of recurring patterns (approvals, drainers, phishing) that can be encoded as rules and models.
- 【P1】 Institutions will accept slightly higher latency and friction in exchange for detailed auditability and risk explanations.
- 【P2】 Retail users will adopt richer verification UX if well-designed and localized.

### 7.3 Alternative Paths (High-Level)

- **Option A – Minimal enhancement**:
  - Stronger warnings, improved function decoding, limited rule-based checks.
- **Option B – In-house behavioral engine**:
  - Full stack: simulation, behavior graphs, anomaly detection, model training.
- **Option C – Vendor + in-house controls hybrid**:
  - Integrate third-party engine for core detection; build proprietary policies and UX on top.

---

## 8. Validating the Answer (Aspect 8)

### 8.1 Potential Biases

- **Technology optimism**: Overestimating achievable accuracy/latency for real-time analysis.
- **Vendor narratives**: Relying too heavily on vendor case studies and marketing claims. [Source: Hypernative & Blockaid marketing materials, 2023–2025]
- **Survivorship bias**: Focusing on publicized attacks while underestimating quiet failures or near-misses.

### 8.2 Required Intelligence

- Detailed dataset of historical blind signing incidents, including on-chain traces and off-chain UX context.
- Per-chain performance and latency benchmarks for simulation and verification under realistic loads.
- Regulatory interpretations from external counsel on what evidentiary standards satisfy MiCA and SEC requirements.

### 8.3 Validation Plan

- **Pilot phase (0–3 months)**:
  - Implement a minimal viable verification pipeline (simulation + core rules for approvals and drainers).
  - Run in "shadow mode" (no blocking) on production traffic; log risk scores and compare against known-bad transactions.
- **Controlled rollout (3–6 months)**:
  - Enable blocking for high-confidence malicious patterns.
  - Monitor loss metrics, false positives, and latency; iterate thresholds and rules.
- **Full rollout & continuous improvement (6–12 months)**:
  - Expand coverage to more chains and protocols.
  - Periodically review models and rules with internal red-team and external auditors.

---

## 9. Revising the Answer (Aspect 9)

### 9.1 Likely Revisions

- Detection thresholds and risk tiers as more data arrives.
- Choice between in-house vs. vendor hybrid models as costs and capabilities become clearer.
- Regulatory mapping assumptions as MiCA guidance, ESMA RTSs, and SEC enforcement practices evolve.

### 9.2 Incremental Approach

- Start with limited scope (top chains + most abused token standards and protocol types).
- Iterate from read-only / advisory mode → soft blocks (extra confirmation) → hard blocks.
- Use A/B tests comparing wallets with and without enhanced verification on loss metrics and UX metrics.

### 9.3 "Good Enough" Criteria

- Verified ≥50–60% reduction in blind signing losses over a 6–12 month window relative to baseline.
- TPR ≥95% and FPR ≤1% on high-severity attack classes in live traffic.
- Latency and abandonment rates within agreed thresholds for major user segments.

## 10. Summary & Action Recommendations (Aspect 10)

### 10.1 Core Insights

1. MPC removes single-key risks but leaves a critical semantic gap: users and institutions still sign opaque payloads, enabling large-scale blind signing exploits.
2. Transaction verification must combine **semantic decoding**, **behavioral history**, and **policy rules** to align on-chain effects with user intent while meeting tight latency and regulatory constraints.
3. A staged approach—starting with approvals and high-risk contract types, piloted in advisory mode—balances risk reduction, UX, and implementation complexity.
4. For many providers, a **hybrid in-house + vendor model** is likely optimal in the near term, with gradual in-sourcing or multi-vendor diversification later.

### 10.2 Near-Term Action List (0–3 Months)

**【P0 – Critical】 Must complete; blocks other work**

1. Define transaction risk taxonomy, severity levels, and blocking vs. advisory policies → **Owner**: Security Lead → **Metric**: Policy coverage of top 5 attack classes = 0 → 100% → **Date**: +6 weeks.
2. Implement minimal verification pipeline (simulation + rules for ERC‑20 approvals, known drainer patterns, suspicious call graphs) in shadow mode → **Owner**: Backend Lead → **Metric**: % of transactions analyzed on main chains = 0 → ≥90% → **Date**: +10 weeks.

**【P1 – Important】 Significant impact**

3. Design and test user-facing risk explanations and escalation flows for both retail and institutional interfaces → **Owner**: Product/UX Lead → **Metric**: Users correctly identifying malicious transactions in lab testing = 40% → ≥80% → **Date**: +12 weeks. [Estimate based on user testing goals; validation via usability studies]
4. Run RFP or vendor evaluation for behavioral verification partners; assess latency, coverage, and integration complexity → **Owner**: Security & Procurement → **Metric**: Shortlisted vendors = 0 → ≥2; comparative evaluation report delivered → **Date**: +12 weeks.

**【P2 – Optional】 <5% impact / can defer**

5. Contribute to or initiate open standards for machine-readable transaction semantics (e.g., ABI metadata, risk annotations) → **Owner**: Developer Relations → **Metric**: Participation in standards group = 0 → active member; draft spec published → **Date**: +9–12 months.

### 10.3 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Trigger Condition | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Latency regression harms trading or UX | High | Medium | p95 latency increase >3s after enabling verification | Optimize simulation, cache results, provide bypass for low-risk flows under rate limits | Backend Lead |
| High false positives erode trust | High | Medium | FPR >1% for critical flows or high user complaint volume | Start in shadow mode, tune thresholds, allow institution-specific overrides with audit logging | Security Lead |
| Regulatory expectations shift | Medium | Medium | New guidance demanding stricter controls or specific mechanisms | Maintain legal counsel engagement, design modular controls that can be adjusted without full re-architecture | Compliance Lead |

### 10.4 Alternative Paths Comparison

| Option | Benefits | Costs | Risks | Best When | Avoid When |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **A. Minimal enhancement (rules + better warnings)** | Fast to ship, low cost, no external vendors | Limited loss reduction, high residual risk, may not satisfy regulators | Users habituate to warnings; complex attacks bypass rules | Small teams, early-stage products, low regulatory exposure | Institutional custody, high-value flows, regions with strict regulation |
| **B. Full in-house behavioral engine** | Maximum control, tailored to stack and clients, deeper integration with MPC flows | High upfront cost (team, infra), ongoing ML/ops burden | Talent scarcity; risk of underperforming vs. vendors | Large providers with strong security/ML teams and scale to justify investment | Small-to-mid providers, or when time-to-compliance is short |
| **C. Hybrid vendor + in-house controls** | Faster coverage using vendor expertise; focus internal effort on UX, policies, and niche use cases | Vendor fees; integration complexity; vendor lock-in risk | Over-reliance on vendor threat intel; multi-tenant data privacy concerns | Mid-to-large providers needing faster rollout and coverage | Contexts requiring strict data locality / on-prem-only solutions |
