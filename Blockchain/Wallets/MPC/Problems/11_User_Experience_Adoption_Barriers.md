## Problem Statement

1. **[Important]** Q: MPC wallets face critical user experience barriers preventing mainstream adoption despite superior security, with complex onboarding requiring technical understanding (threshold concepts, key share distribution, recovery procedures), 2-15 second transaction latencies frustrating users accustomed to instant Web2 experiences, unintuitive recovery processes causing funds loss when users misunderstand share requirements, and minimal user education about security trade-offs (performance vs. security, honest-but-curious vs. malicious security models), resulting in <5% mainstream adoption rate compared to traditional wallets and traders disabling MPC features for speed. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     MPC wallets promise institutional-grade security through distributed key shares, but user experience complexity creates adoption barriers blocking mainstream use [Source: Web search results, 2025]. Critical UX problems: (1) Onboarding confusion where users must understand threshold concepts (2-of-3, 3-of-5 models), decide share distribution (device, cloud, trusted contacts), and complete multi-step setup taking 15-30 minutes vs. 2-3 minutes for traditional wallets [Guide: Stackup, 2025]; (2) Transaction latency where 2-15 second signing delays (network coordination between distributed shares) frustrate users expecting <1 second Web2 response times, causing traders to disable MPC entirely for speed [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; (3) Recovery complexity where users lose funds by misunderstanding which shares are needed, forgetting where shares are stored, or failing to maintain backup shares (44% of users concerned about losing access [Report: RIF Technology, 2024]); (4) Education gap where users don't understand security trade-offs (some providers sacrifice security for <3s latency using "honest-but-curious" MPC vulnerable to single malicious party vs. 10s latency for secure implementations [Blog: Cubist, 2024]), terminology confusion (threshold vs. multisig, shares vs. shards, key never exists vs. key reconstructed during signing), and hidden centralization risks (provider holds key shares creating de facto custody [Blog: Cubist, 2024]); (5) Friction points where users must be online simultaneously for signing (coordinating 3-of-5 signers across time zones delays approvals), error messages are cryptographic jargon ("Paillier key validation failed" meaningless to non-experts), and fallback procedures unclear when shares are unavailable. Impact: <5% mainstream adoption despite security advantages (most users choose simpler EOA wallets or hardware wallets sacrificing distributed security for familiar UX), institutional adoption limited to sophisticated users with dedicated technical teams, consumer-facing applications avoid MPC due to support burden (user confusion generates support tickets).
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Traditional wallet UX baseline: EOA wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet) offer instant onboarding (2-3 minutes: install app, save seed phrase, done), instant transaction signing (<1 second local cryptography), and simple recovery (enter 12/24-word seed phrase) [industry standard]. Hardware wallets add security through physical devices but maintain 1-2 second signing latency and straightforward setup [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. Smart contract multisig wallets (Safe/Gnosis) require technical sophistication (understand smart contracts, coordinate multiple signers, pay higher gas fees) but provide transparent on-chain security visible to users [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. MPC wallet UX reality: Onboarding complexity requires understanding threshold cryptography concepts foreign to mainstream users [Report: RIF Technology, 2024]. ZenGo consumer MPC wallet simplifies to 2-of-2 (user device + ZenGo server) with biometric authentication, eliminating seed phrases but introducing server dependency and 2-5 second latency [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. Fireblocks enterprise MPC requires 3-4 threshold configuration (3-of-4 shares to sign), HSM integration planning, geographical share distribution decisions, taking weeks to deploy with dedicated technical teams [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. Transaction latency problem acute: secure MPC implementations require 10 seconds for full cryptographic protocol (zero-knowledge proofs, multi-round communication), but users trained by Web2 expect <1s responses; result is vendors sacrifice security for speed using "honest-but-curious" MPC variants vulnerable to single deviation [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Cubist team reports: "Ten second latencies aren't something that traders, gamers, or really anyone who's used normal web will put up with; we've talked to traders who use popular MPC wallets with MPC turned off" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Recovery nightmare: unlike seed phrases where 12 words restore complete wallet, MPC requires threshold shares which users may store on forgotten devices, distributed to contacts who changed email addresses, or backed up in cloud services they no longer access [inferred from recovery complexity]. 44% of potential users cite "losing access to wallet" as top concern preventing crypto adoption [Report: RIF Technology, 2024]. Error handling catastrophic: when shares unavailable (offline device, unresponsive co-signer, corrupted share data), users face cryptographic error messages ("threshold not met", "invalid signature generation", "share corruption detected") with unclear remediation steps [inferred from MPC operational characteristics]. Education gap severe: users don't know that "2-of-2 honest-but-curious MPC" means provider compromise alone breaks security, that geographic share distribution trades performance for security (5-10s latency vs. 2-5s collocated), or that some implementations materialize complete private keys during generation despite marketing claims "key never exists" [Blog: Cubist, 2024].
   
   - **Goals and success criteria**: 
     Adoption rate: Increase mainstream MPC wallet adoption from <5% → ≥25% of crypto users by Q4 2027 (measured by wallet downloads, active users, transaction volume). Onboarding time: Reduce setup time from 15-30 minutes → <5 minutes for consumer MPC wallets through simplified flows, pre-configured defaults (2-of-2 vs. forcing users to understand 2-of-3 vs. 3-of-5), guided share distribution (automated backup to encrypted cloud + optional social recovery vs. manual configuration). Transaction latency perception: Achieve user satisfaction >4.0/5.0 with signing speed by optimizing perceived performance (progress indicators, optimistic UI updates, background signing) even if cryptographic latency remains 2-5s, measured through app store reviews and user surveys. Latency targets: <3s for 90% of transactions (p90), <5s for 99% (p99), <10s maximum with clear progress indication. Recovery success rate: Increase successful recoveries from unknown baseline → ≥95% of users completing recovery without support intervention by Q4 2026 through simplified procedures (guided recovery flows, visual share status, proactive share health monitoring, backup reminders). Education effectiveness: Achieve ≥80% user comprehension of security model through in-app education (interactive tutorials, security comparison tools, terminology glossaries) measured by comprehension quizzes before key generation. Security transparency: Require 100% of providers to disclose security models (honest-but-curious vs. malicious security, latency vs. security trade-offs, centralization risks) in user-facing documentation by Q2 2026. Error clarity: Reduce support tickets from error confusion by 70% through plain-language error messages ("Share unavailable on backup device. Use recovery email or contact support" vs. "Share reconstruction failed: insufficient threshold"), actionable remediation steps, and proactive monitoring alerting users before failures. Coordination friction: Enable asynchronous signing for 80% of use cases (pre-authorization, delayed execution, policy-based automatic approval) reducing need for real-time coordination across distributed signers. Accessibility: Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for wallet interfaces enabling use by visually impaired users (screen reader support, high contrast modes, keyboard navigation) expanding addressable market.
   
   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for UX redesign + implementation + user testing + adoption); Budget: $2M-$6M per major provider for UX overhaul (user research $200K-$400K, design $300K-$600K, engineering $1M-$3M, testing $200K-$500K, education content $300K-$1M, support infrastructure $300K-$1M); Team: Per provider requires 2-3 UX researchers (user studies, usability testing, persona development), 3-5 product designers (interaction design, visual design, prototyping), 6-12 engineers (frontend, mobile, backend for simplified flows), 2-3 technical writers (documentation, tutorials, error messages), 3-5 customer support specialists (handling confused users during transition); Technology: Cannot eliminate cryptographic latency (MPC inherently requires network coordination + expensive cryptography), must work within 2-5s technical constraint through perceived performance optimization; Cannot simplify security model beyond certain point (threshold cryptography complexity inherent to MPC's security guarantees); Must maintain backward compatibility with existing users (cannot force disruptive UX changes on current deployments); Performance constraints: Latency improvements limited by protocol choice (CGGMP21 4-round signing vs. GG18 9-round, geographic share distribution adds 3-10s), mobile device CPU limitations for zero-knowledge proofs, network connectivity variability (poor connections add 5-15s); User expectations misalignment: Web2 users trained on <1s response times, crypto natives trained on hardware wallet 1-2s signing, institutional users accepting 5-10s latency for security; Education difficulty: Threshold cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, honest-but-curious vs. malicious security models are graduate-level cryptography concepts; simplifying without misleading users challenges product communication; Support scalability: Consumer wallets need support infrastructure handling confused users (44% worried about losing access [Report: RIF Technology, 2024]), higher support burden than traditional wallets increases operational costs; Trust paradox: Simplifying UX often means more centralization (provider-held shares, automated decisions), conflicting with decentralization ethos.
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     End Users - Mainstream Consumers (target: 200M+ potential crypto users [Report: RIF Technology, 2024], need Web2-level simplicity <5 minute onboarding + <3s transactions, constraint: zero cryptography knowledge, expect instant responses, 44% concerned about losing access); End Users - Crypto Natives (10M+ current users, need security without sacrificing familiar UX patterns, constraint: distrust centralized shortcuts, demand full self-custody); End Users - Traders (est. 5,000+ professionals, need <1s transaction latency for high-frequency strategies, constraint: willing to sacrifice security for speed, currently disable MPC features [Blog: Cubist, 2024]); MPC Wallet Providers (15+ companies competing for users, need adoption without compromising security narrative, constraint: UX improvements require $2M-$6M investment per provider + 24 month timeline, simplified UX risks "dumbing down" security value proposition); Application Developers (DApp builders, DeFi protocols, Web3 games integrating wallets, need embedded wallet UX matching Web2 standards, constraint: support burden from confused end users limits MPC adoption); Customer Support Teams (5-20 agents per major provider, need reduced support ticket volume from UX confusion, constraint: support costs scale with user confusion, complex technical issues require specialized training); Product Designers & UX Researchers (200+ professionals across wallet providers, need user research budget + authority to prioritize UX over feature velocity, constraint: technical complexity limits design creativity, cryptographic constraints are non-negotiable); Educators & Content Creators (crypto education platforms, YouTubers, technical writers, need clear mental models for teaching MPC concepts, constraint: threshold cryptography genuinely complex, simplification risks misleading users); Regulators (financial authorities, need wallet providers to avoid dark patterns hiding custody risks, constraint: simplified UX must not obscure centralization where providers control shares).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for UX research + design + implementation + testing + adoption + iteration based on feedback); Systems: Mobile wallet applications (iOS, Android with 2-5s signing latency, biometric authentication, offline signing for some flows), web applications (browser extensions, web interfaces with WebAuthn integration), onboarding flows (KYC integration, share distribution setup, backup configuration, education modules), transaction signing UX (progress indicators, optimistic updates, batching, pre-authorization), recovery procedures (guided flows, share health monitoring, social recovery, customer support escalation), error handling (plain-language messages, actionable remediation, proactive monitoring), education systems (in-app tutorials, comparison tools, glossaries, video content, interactive simulations); Current state: <5% mainstream adoption due to UX complexity (most users choose simpler EOA wallets), traders disable MPC for speed [Blog: Cubist, 2024], 44% potential users concerned about losing access [Report: RIF Technology, 2024], unknown recovery success rate but anecdotal evidence of funds loss from misunderstood share requirements, high support ticket volume from confused users; Scale: 200M+ potential mainstream users [Report: RIF Technology, 2024], 10M+ crypto natives, 5,000+ professional traders, 15+ major wallet providers needing UX overhaul, thousands of DApps requiring embedded wallet integration; Impact if successful: 5× increase in MPC adoption (5% → 25%), 70% reduction in support tickets from UX confusion, 95% recovery success rate, mainstream legitimization of crypto through usable security; Impact if unsuccessful: MPC remains niche institutional tool, mainstream users continue using insecure EOA wallets with 100% funds loss if key compromised, crypto adoption limited by security-usability trade-off; Use cases: Consumer payments (daily transactions requiring <3s latency), institutional treasury (sophisticated users accepting 5-10s latency for security), DeFi interactions (transaction batching reducing latency impact), gaming (embedded wallets requiring Web2 UX), social recovery (distributing shares to trusted contacts without technical knowledge).
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2017-2020: First-generation MPC wallets (Fireblocks, Unbound Security) targeted enterprises accepting complex UX for security [inferred from enterprise focus]. Consumer adoption negligible due to technical sophistication required. 2020-2022: ZenGo launched consumer-focused 2-of-2 MPC with biometric authentication, eliminating seed phrases [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. Key innovation: simplified threshold model (user device + ZenGo server) vs. forcing users to understand 3-of-5 configurations. Adoption improved but limited by 2-5s transaction latency vs. instant EOA wallets, server dependency concerns (ZenGo holds share creating custody-like risks). 2022-2023: Web3Auth, Magic, Privy, Dynamic launched "embedded wallets" with social login (Google, Apple, email), further abstracting MPC complexity [Market landscape, 2025]. Approach: pre-configured 2-of-2 MPC with provider-held shares, users never see "threshold" or "shares" terminology. Trade-off: excellent onboarding UX (2-3 minutes, familiar OAuth flows) but significant centralization (providers hold shares, can be compelled by legal process or compromised). Adoption accelerated in gaming/social applications prioritizing UX over self-custody. 2023-2024: Latency problems became acute as user base expanded beyond early adopters. Cubist team analysis revealed traders disabling MPC for speed: "we've talked to traders who use popular MPC wallets with MPC turned off" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Some providers began using "honest-but-curious" MPC variants achieving <3s latency but vulnerable to single malicious party [Blog: Cubist, 2024]. Key lesson: Users will sacrifice security for speed; must meet latency expectations or lose users. 2024-2025: Hybrid approaches emerged attempting to balance UX and security. Stackup keystore architecture combines MPC privacy with smart contract flexibility, using cryptographic commitments to maintain privacy while enabling complex policies [Guide: Stackup, 2025]. Recovery innovations: Social recovery (distribute shares to contacts), biometric recovery (ZenGo face scan + email verification), time-locked recovery (delay allowing intervention if unauthorized). Error handling improvements: Some providers added share health monitoring (alert before failure vs. surprising users with "threshold not met" errors), guided recovery flows (step-by-step vs. cryptographic jargon), customer support escalation (live chat from error screens vs. forcing users to find support separately). Key lesson: Proactive UX (monitoring, prevention, guidance) reduces confusion better than reactive support. Current challenges remaining: 2-5s latency ceiling from cryptographic requirements, education gap about security models, coordination friction for distributed signers, recovery complexity, support scalability, trust paradox (simpler UX requires more centralization).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: Traditional EOA wallets offer 2-3 minute onboarding, instant signing [industry standard]; Hardware wallets provide 1-2 second signing latency [Guide: Stackup, 2025]; Secure MPC implementations require 10 seconds for full cryptographic protocol [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; "Ten second latencies aren't something that traders, gamers, or really anyone who's used normal web will put up with" [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; Traders disable MPC features for speed [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; "Honest-but-curious" MPC variants sacrifice security for <3s latency [Blog: Cubist, 2024]; 44% of potential users cite "losing access to wallet" as top concern [Report: RIF Technology, 2024]; ZenGo uses 2-of-2 model (user device + server) with biometric authentication, 2-5s latency [Guide: Stackup, 2025]; Fireblocks enterprise MPC requires weeks to deploy with technical teams [Guide: Stackup, 2025]; CGGMP21 achieves 4-round signing (more efficient than GG18's 9 rounds) [Guide: Stackup, 2025].
     - **Assumptions**: <5% mainstream adoption rate (inferred from market observation that MPC wallets remain niche vs. EOA wallets' dominance); 200M+ potential mainstream crypto users (extrapolated from global interest in cryptocurrency, regulatory clarity enabling broader adoption); 15-30 minute current onboarding time for MPC wallets (estimated from threshold configuration, share distribution, backup setup vs. 2-3 minute EOA baseline); Unknown current recovery success rate (no public statistics, anecdotal evidence of funds loss from share misunderstanding); $2M-$6M per provider for UX overhaul (user research $200K-$400K + design $300K-$600K + engineering $1M-$3M + testing $200K-$500K + education $300K-$1M + support $300K-$1M); 70% reduction in support tickets achievable through UX improvements (estimated from addressing root causes of confusion: unclear errors, complex recovery, poor education); 95% recovery success rate target (based on traditional wallet recovery baselines with seed phrases); Geographic share distribution adds 3-10s latency (network round-trip time across continents).
     - **Uncertainties**: What percentage of users actually understand MPC security model after onboarding? (comprehension not measured systematically); How many users lose funds due to misunderstood recovery procedures? (no public data on MPC recovery failures); What is acceptable latency for different use cases? (<1s for trading, <3s for payments, <10s for treasury?); Will mainstream users accept 2-5s latency if explained as security trade-off? Or demand <1s like Web2?; Can perceived performance optimization (progress indicators, optimistic UI) make 5s feel acceptable? Or is sub-second latency non-negotiable?; What is optimal balance between simplicity and security transparency? (Abstract complexity risks hiding centralization; expose complexity risks confusing users); Will regulatory pressure force custody disclosure for provider-held shares? (affecting embedded wallet model); How much will support costs increase with mainstream adoption? (consumer users generate more tickets than sophisticated institutions); Can education scale? (interactive tutorials effective or require human tutoring?); Will hybrid architectures (Stackup keystore model) achieve better UX-security balance than pure MPC?; What is long-term user retention for MPC wallets? (Do users who onboard successfully continue using or revert to simpler wallets?).

## Glossary

- **Asynchronous signing**: MPC signing model where participants pre-authorize transactions executed later, eliminating need for real-time coordination; reduces coordination friction for distributed signers.
- **Embedded wallet**: Wallet integrated directly into application with social login (Google, Apple, email); typically 2-of-2 MPC with provider-held shares, prioritizing UX over pure self-custody.
- **EOA (Externally Owned Account)**: Traditional Ethereum wallet with single private key; instant signing, simple recovery via seed phrase, 100% funds loss if key compromised.
- **Honest-but-curious MPC**: Security model assuming parties follow protocol but may observe data; broken by single malicious party; achieves <3s latency vs. 10s for secure malicious-security protocols.
- **Perceived performance**: Optimization techniques (progress indicators, optimistic UI updates, background processing) making cryptographic latency feel faster even if actual computation time unchanged.
- **Share health monitoring**: Proactive system checking share availability (devices online, backups accessible, contacts reachable) and alerting users before failures vs. surprising them during recovery attempts.
- **Social recovery**: Distributing encrypted key shares to trusted contacts (friends, family) who individually hold useless data but collectively enable account recovery without technical knowledge.
- **Threshold cryptography**: Cryptographic technique enabling k-of-n parties to jointly sign without reconstructing complete key; foundation of MPC security but graduate-level concept challenging for mainstream users.
- **Transaction latency**: Time from user initiating transaction to signed output; MPC inherently 2-15s (network coordination + expensive cryptography) vs. <1s for EOA wallets or Web2 applications.
