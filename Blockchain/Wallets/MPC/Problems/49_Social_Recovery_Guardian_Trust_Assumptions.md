**Status**: Draft  
**Owner**: Security & Product Team

## Problem Statement

1. **[CRITICAL]** Q: MPC wallets implementing social recovery mechanisms face critical trust assumption vulnerabilities where guardian collusion, social engineering, coercion, or guardianship disputes can compromise user assets despite distributed key architecture, affecting seedless wallet implementations serving 50M+ users who rely on guardian networks for key recovery without understanding trust model implications or attack vectors. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: 
     Social recovery wallets solve seed phrase usability problem by distributing recovery authority among trusted guardians (friends, family, institutions) who can cooperatively reconstruct key shares to restore wallet access if user loses primary device, but create new trust vulnerabilities where: (1) Guardian collusion—majority of guardians (e.g., 3-of-5 threshold) coordinate to steal user funds without consent through legitimate recovery mechanism; (2) Social engineering—attackers manipulate guardians individually through impersonation, urgency, or deception to initiate unauthorized recovery; (3) Coercion—physical threats against user or guardians to force recovery approval; (4) Guardianship disputes—relationship breakdowns (divorce, business disputes, family conflicts) lead to guardian refusal to cooperate in legitimate recovery or malicious initiation of unauthorized recovery [Guide: Yellow Social Recovery, 2025; Technical: Gate.com Social Recovery]. Financial exposure severe: MPC wallets with social recovery (ZenGo, Web3Auth, Magic, Dfns) serve est. 50M+ users with $5B+ assets (retail-focused, lower per-user balances than institutional custody), single successful guardian collusion attack could drain individual accounts $1K-$100K+, systematic social engineering campaign targeting multiple users could result in $10M-$100M+ losses industry-wide [Market: Seedless Wallet Adoption]. Trust assumption gap: Users select guardians based on personal relationships without security analysis—friends/family lack adversarial security mindset, institutional guardians (email providers, cloud storage) create centralization risks contradicting decentralization goals, no standardized guardian selection criteria or security training, median user understanding of trust model <20% (estimate based on wallet security survey data showing low comprehension of recovery mechanisms) [Analysis: User Security Awareness]. Implementation complexity: Guardian notification mechanisms vulnerable to interception (email/SMS compromise enables fake recovery requests), guardian authentication often weak (email verification only, no multi-factor), time-lock delays (24-72h typical) provide window for intervention but may be insufficient against sophisticated attacks, no on-chain evidence of coercion vs. legitimate recovery distinguishable [Technical: Recovery Implementation]. Current mitigation landscape fragmented: Some wallets implement "guardian diversity" requirements (mix of personal + institutional), others offer "social recovery insurance" (wallet provider co-signs recovery requiring KYC verification), but no industry standard for guardian trust model, security properties vary dramatically between implementations creating user confusion [Market: Social Recovery Variance].
   
   - **Background and current situation**: 
     Social recovery wallets emerged 2019-2020 addressing seed phrase problems: 20% of Bitcoin permanently lost due to key loss, seed phrase backup friction drives users to insecure alternatives (exchange custody, cloud storage screenshots), non-technical users cannot reliably manage 12/24-word seed phrases [Research: Bitcoin Loss Statistics; Analysis: Seed Phrase Usability]. Vitalik Buterin advocated social recovery 2021 as "the way forward for crypto" arguing distributed trust among personal relationships more practical than individual key management for mainstream adoption [Blog: Vitalik Social Recovery]. **Social recovery architecture**: User maintains primary signing key for daily transactions (mobile device, browser storage), designates n guardians each receiving encrypted key share, recovery requires m-of-n guardian threshold (typical 3-of-5, 2-of-3), guardians approve recovery through cryptographic signatures, reconstructed key grants full wallet control [Technical: Social Recovery Protocol]. **Guardian types**: (1) **Personal guardians**—friends, family members, colleagues designated through wallet address or email, relationship-based trust, no formal security training, responsive time varies (hours to days). Example: Alice designates 5 guardians: mother, brother, best friend, business partner, ex-colleague; 3-of-5 threshold for recovery. (2) **Institutional guardians**—email providers (Gmail recovery codes), cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive encrypted backups), hardware wallets (Ledger as guardian device), wallet provider services (ZenGo recovery service, Web3Auth backup), professional custody services. Centralization concern: if Gmail is guardian, Google holds effective veto power over recovery. (3) **Hybrid models**—require both personal + institutional guardian approval (e.g., 2 personal + 1 institutional from 5 total), balances convenience vs. decentralization [Implementation: Guardian Types]. **Trust vulnerabilities**: **Guardian collusion**—if 3 guardians among 5 coordinate maliciously, can initiate recovery, receive full wallet control, transfer all assets before user detects. Motivation: financial gain ($10K-$100K+ per successful attack), relationship deterioration (family disputes, business breakup), external coercion (guardians themselves threatened). Detection difficult: recovery mechanism legitimate, on-chain transactions appear normal, user has no advance warning. Mitigation: time-locks (24-72h delay), user notification (email/SMS alert), cancellation option (user can abort recovery if detected). Limitation: time-lock assumes user monitors notifications within delay period (vacation, hospitalization, digital detox makes detection improbable), cancellation requires access to backup communication channel (if primary device lost, how does user receive notification?) [Attack: Guardian Collusion]. **Social engineering against guardians**—attacker impersonates user contacting guardians individually: "Hey mom, I lost my phone and need to recover my wallet, please approve this recovery request", guardian lacks technical sophistication to verify legitimacy, approves request believing they're helping user. Variation: urgency manipulation ("I'm traveling abroad, phone stolen, urgent medical expense, please approve immediately"), authority impersonation (fake wallet provider email: "Security team detected suspicious activity, guardian approval required to prevent account freeze"). Scale: attacker systematically targets all guardians in parallel, achieving threshold (3-of-5) before any guardian consults user directly. Success rate high for non-technical guardians (elderly parents, technologically-unsavvy friends)—estimated 40-60% approval rate for sophisticated phishing against unprepared guardians [Attack: Social Engineering]. **Coercion**—physical threat against user or guardians to force recovery approval. Scenario 1: $5 wrench attack against user ("Give me your wallet recovery or face violence"), user contacts guardians requesting recovery, guardians approve believing request legitimate, attacker gains wallet control. Scenario 2: attacker threatens guardian directly ("Your daughter's wallet contains $50K, help me recover it or face consequences"), guardian approves to avoid harm. Cryptographic protocols cannot distinguish coercion from legitimate requests—signatures valid regardless of circumstances [Attack: Coercion]. **Guardianship disputes**—relationship breakdowns create recovery risks. Divorce scenario: ex-spouse designated as guardian refuses to cooperate in legitimate recovery (device genuinely lost), user locked out of wallet with no recourse if threshold unachievable. Malicious scenario: ex-spouse colludes with other guardians to drain wallet during custody dispute. Business disputes: former business partner designated as guardian initiates unauthorized recovery during company dissolution to claim perceived share of disputed funds. No legal framework: courts cannot compel cryptographic key share disclosure, guardianship obligations undefined in law [Conflict: Relationship Breakdown]. **Guardian notification vulnerabilities**: Recovery requests sent via email/SMS to guardians, attacker intercepts communications: compromised email account enables fake recovery request injection, SMS interception (SIM swap, SS7 attack) allows impersonation. Guardian authentication weak: email link click + basic verification (no multi-factor common), guardians unfamiliar with verification procedures accept fake requests. Time-lock defeats: 24-72h delay assumes user monitoring, but notification channel compromise means user never receives alert—recovery completes unopposed [Vulnerability: Notification Channel]. **Current implementations**: **ZenGo** (500K+ users, 2-of-3 recovery)—guardians: user device + ZenGo server + user's iCloud/Google Drive backup, hybrid model reduces pure guardian collusion risk but centralizes trust in ZenGo and cloud provider [Product: ZenGo Recovery]. **Web3Auth** (10M+ users, customizable guardian thresholds)—supports email-based guardians (Gmail, Outlook), blockchain addresses, SMS, offers optional "Verifier" (OAuth provider) as institutional guardian, highly flexible but complex security properties varying by configuration [Product: Web3Auth Recovery]. **Argent** (early smart contract wallet 2018)—pioneered social recovery on Ethereum, 3-5 day time-lock standard, guardians Ethereum addresses (hardware wallets, other Argent users, Argent official guardian service), limited adoption due to UX friction and gas costs [Product: Argent Social Recovery]. **Safe (Gnosis Safe)** (100K+ deployed multisigs)—supports optional recovery module ERC-7093 standard, smart contract-based guardian management, on-chain execution transparency, but requires technical sophistication to configure correctly [Platform: Safe Recovery Module]. **Loopring Smart Wallet**—social recovery + on-chain guardians, official Loopring guardian service available, zkRollup reduces gas costs, but limited ecosystem integration [Product: Loopring Recovery].

   - **Key constraints and resources**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for guardian authentication upgrades, security training rollout, legal framework development, user education, industry standards); Budget: $300K-$1M per major provider for guardian security improvements (multi-factor guardian authentication $100K-$300K for infrastructure + hardware key distribution, security training program $50K-$100K for content creation + onboarding flow, legal consultation $50K-$150K for guardianship framework analysis, incident monitoring $50K-$200K for real-time recovery detection, user education UX $50K-$200K); Team: Per provider: 2-3 product engineers (guardian authentication, recovery flow redesign, time-lock optimization), 1-2 security engineers (attack simulation, monitoring, incident response), 1-2 UX designers (guardian selection guidance, security education interface), 1 legal counsel (guardianship obligation analysis, liability assessment), 0.5-1 education specialist (security training content, guardian onboarding materials); Technology: Multi-factor authentication for guardians (hardware keys like YubiKey $50-$100 per guardian, biometric verification APIs, device attestation platforms), real-time recovery monitoring (on-chain event listeners, notification infrastructure supporting email + SMS + push + Web3 messaging), encrypted communication channels (E2E encrypted guardian approval flow preventing notification interception), decentralized dispute resolution integration (Kleros Court API, Reality.eth oracle, professional arbitration services), guardian training platforms (interactive security education, phishing simulation, verification procedure walkthroughs); Trust model tradeoffs: Increasing guardian authentication friction (hardware keys, video verification) improves security but reduces adoption (guardians refuse to participate if too complex), time-lock extensions (7+ days) reduce unauthorized recovery success but increase legitimate recovery frustration (user must wait week for access), institutional guardian requirements (wallet provider co-sign) prevent pure collusion but centralize trust contradicting decentralization goals, no perfect solution—must optimize for threat model vs. usability [Constraint: Security-Usability Tradeoff]; Guardian coordination complexity: More guardians = higher collusion resistance but increased coordination difficulty (achieving 5-of-9 threshold harder than 3-of-5, guardian availability varies), geographic distribution improves diversity but creates time-zone communication challenges (24h recovery delay may span multiple days accounting for guardian response times across continents), relationship changes over time (friends move, family disputes arise) requiring guardian rotation mechanisms increasing management burden [Constraint: Coordination Overhead]; Legal uncertainty: Guardianship fiduciary duties undefined in most jurisdictions (is guardian liable for negligent approval? Can user sue guardian for refusing legitimate recovery? What standard of verification required?), cross-border guardianship complications (US guardian helping EU user recover wallet—which jurisdiction's laws apply?), no precedent for cryptographic guardianship in traditional fiduciary law creating liability ambiguity discouraging institutional guardian participation [Constraint: Legal Uncertainty]; User education challenge: Explaining guardian trust model requires understanding: threshold cryptography basics, collusion attack vectors, social engineering techniques, coercion scenarios, guardian selection criteria—median user technical literacy insufficient for informed decision-making, risk of "guardian fatigue" where users skip security explanations clicking "next" through setup wizard without comprehension [Constraint: Education Effectiveness].
   
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: 
     End Users with Social Recovery (est. 50M+ across ZenGo, Web3Auth, Magic, Dfns, need recovery access if device lost with protection against unauthorized recovery, constraint: limited security expertise to evaluate guardian trust model and select appropriate guardians); Designated Guardians (est. 200M+ individuals designated by 50M users at avg 4 guardians each, need clear verification procedures and liability protection, constraint: unpaid volunteer role with security responsibility, limited technical sophistication for most personal guardians); MPC Wallet Providers with Social Recovery (ZenGo 500K+ users, Web3Auth 10M+ users, Magic, Dfns, need to differentiate through recovery UX while preventing guardian-based attacks, constraint: $300K-$1M security upgrade costs and usability tradeoffs); Institutional Guardian Services (email providers like Gmail/Outlook providing account recovery as guardian mechanism, cloud storage providers like iCloud/Google Drive for backup guardianship, wallet provider official guardian services, need scalable verification without legal liability, constraint: unclear fiduciary duties and potential regulatory scrutiny if positioned as "custody" service); Security Researchers (analyzing guardian attack vectors, testing social engineering effectiveness, need access to recovery implementations for testing, constraint: responsible disclosure of guardian vulnerabilities may harm user confidence in social recovery model); Regulators (financial authorities evaluating whether guardian-based recovery creates "custodial" classification requiring licensing, consumer protection agencies assessing guardian liability framework, need to protect consumers without stifling innovation, constraint: cryptographic guardianship doesn't fit traditional fiduciary categories); Legal Experts (defining guardianship obligations, liability for negligent approval, dispute resolution mechanisms, need to establish precedent through case law or legislation, constraint: cross-jurisdictional complexity and lack of cryptographic expertise among traditional lawyers); Insurance Providers (crypto wallet insurance considering guardian attack coverage, need to price social engineering and collusion risks, constraint: limited actuarial data on guardian-based attacks, coverage exclusions for "authorized" recovery may leave users unprotected); Family/Relationship Counselors (mediating guardian disputes during divorce, business dissolution, family conflicts, need understanding of cryptographic guardianship implications, constraint: no training on digital asset guardianship in traditional counseling education); User Advocacy Groups (promoting user rights in guardian disputes, establishing best practices for guardian selection, need to educate users on trust model implications, constraint: limited resources and reach compared to wallet providers).
   
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: 
     Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q4 2027 (24 months for guardian authentication upgrades, security training programs, legal framework development, industry standards adoption); Systems: Social recovery smart contracts (ERC-7093 guardian management standard, recovery execution logic), guardian notification infrastructure (email/SMS/push notification services, E2E encrypted communication channels), multi-factor guardian authentication (hardware key integration, biometric verification, video call systems), time-lock mechanisms (on-chain delays, cancellation interfaces), dispute resolution platforms (Kleros Court integration, professional arbitration services), guardian training platforms (security education modules, phishing simulation, verification walkthroughs), user education interfaces (guardian selection guidance, trust model explanations, setup quizzes); Current landscape: est. 50M+ users across social recovery wallet implementations (ZenGo 500K+, Web3Auth 10M+, Magic several million, Dfns institutional but growing), ~30% require institutional guardian preventing pure personal guardian collusion, ~20% implement strong multi-factor guardian authentication, ~5% of designated guardians receive security training, est. 40-60% unauthorized approval rate for sophisticated social engineering against unprepared guardians, <5% user comprehension of guardian trust model security properties [Market: Social Recovery Adoption]; Risk exposure: $5B+ assets under social recovery wallet management (retail-focused, $100-$10K typical per-user), individual attack success could drain $1K-$100K+ per wallet, systematic campaign targeting 1,000 users could result $10M-$100M+ industry-wide losses, single high-profile guardian collusion incident would severely damage social recovery adoption and mainstream crypto onboarding momentum [Financial: Risk Exposure]; Attack surface: 200M+ designated guardians (50M users × 4 avg guardians) represent massive social engineering target, personal guardians lack security training (elderly parents, non-technical friends), institutional guardians create centralization (Gmail compromise affects millions of guardianship relationships), guardian notification channels vulnerable to interception (email/SMS not E2E encrypted in most implementations), relationship changes over time create adversarial ex-guardians (divorce, business disputes), no legal deterrent against guardian collusion (unclear if theft or legitimate recovery) [Surface: Attack Vectors]; Multi-jurisdiction complexity: Social recovery wallets operate globally but guardianship law varies dramatically: US common law fiduciary duties may apply differently than civil law jurisdictions, EU GDPR creates data residency complications for guardian personal information, cross-border guardian coordination (US user, EU guardian) creates jurisdictional ambiguity in disputes, China/India/Brazil have distinct crypto regulatory approaches affecting guardian legality, no international standard for guardianship obligations enabling regulatory arbitrage [Jurisdiction: Global Complexity]; Implementation variance: Different wallet providers implement different trust models: ZenGo 2-of-3 (device + server + cloud) centralizes trust, Web3Auth fully customizable (user chooses threshold and guardian types) maximizes flexibility but complexity, Argent pioneered model now considered overly complex (low adoption), Safe modular approach enables experimentation but requires technical configuration, Loopring on-chain transparency auditable but gas cost prohibitive—no convergence on optimal model creating user confusion and inconsistent security properties [Implementation: Heterogeneity].
   
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: 
     2011-2017: Early Bitcoin recovery mechanisms focused on seed phrase backups (BIP39 12/24-word mnemonics) and multi-signature wallets requiring k-of-n signatures but no social recovery concept (all signers must be online, no emergency recovery if keys lost). Seed phrase problems well-documented: 20% Bitcoin lost permanently, users write phrases on paper (fire/flood loss), take photos (cloud hack exposure), or skip backup entirely (device loss = total fund loss). 2018: Argent wallet launched Ethereum smart contract social recovery, pioneered guardian model with 3-5 day time-lock and guardian-based key rotation [Launch: Argent 2018]. Innovative but adoption limited by: Ethereum gas costs ($10-$50 per recovery transaction 2021 bull market), guardian designation friction (requires Ethereum address, hardware wallet, or Argent guardian service), UX complexity (explaining smart contracts to mainstream users failed). 2019-2020: Loopring Smart Wallet implemented zkRollup-based social recovery reducing gas costs 10-100x, added official Loopring guardian service as institutional backstop [Product: Loopring Recovery]. Limited ecosystem integration restricted growth (zkRollup requires Loopring-specific infrastructure). 2021: Vitalik Buterin published "Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets" arguing personal relationships more practical than individual key management, advocating for guardian-based recovery as crypto's path to mainstream adoption [Blog: Vitalik Social Recovery 2021]. Catalyzed industry attention but also revealed trust assumption concerns raised by critics: "You're trusting friends/family with your wealth", "What if guardians collude?", "Isn't this just multi-sig with extra steps?" 2021-2022: ZenGo popularized seedless MPC wallet with 2-of-3 recovery (device + server + cloud backup), hybrid model balancing convenience (iCloud/Google Drive familiar to users) vs. decentralization (no single party has full control) [Product: ZenGo Model]. Achieved 500K+ users but criticized for trusting ZenGo server + cloud provider (not fully non-custodial). Web3Auth/Magic scaling social recovery to 10M+ users through OAuth-based guardians (Gmail, Discord, Twitter) enabling "sign in with Google to recover crypto wallet" UX matching Web2 familiarity [Growth: Web3Auth Adoption]. Lowered friction dramatically but exacerbated centralization concerns (Google/Discord control recovery). 2023: ERC-7093 Social Recovery Interface proposed as Ethereum standard defining guardian management functions (addGuardian, removeGuardian, initiateRecovery, confirmRecovery, cancelRecovery) creating interoperability across wallet implementations [Standard: ERC-7093]. Adoption slow (standard still draft, not finalized), but provides reference specification. 2024: Guardian collusion concerns surfaced in security analysis—academic papers demonstrated social engineering success rates 40-60% against non-technical guardians through phishing simulation studies [Research: Guardian Social Engineering]. Wallet providers began adding guardian multi-factor authentication (hardware keys for high-value institutional guardians) and security training modules, but no industry-wide standard. Key lessons: Social recovery trades cryptographic security (seed phrase) for social trust (guardian relationships)—not eliminating trust, redistributing it. Guardian selection critical but users lack framework (should I choose 3 close friends or 5 distributed acquaintances? Mix personal + institutional?). Time-locks necessary but insufficient (sophisticated attacks achieve guardian threshold before user notification, cancellation requires backup communication). Education paramount but difficult (explaining guardian attack vectors requires security sophistication median user lacks). No perfect solution—must accept tradeoffs and optimize for target user segment (retail users prioritize convenience accepting centralization, crypto-native users prioritize decentralization accepting friction).
   
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: 
     - **Facts**: 20% of Bitcoin permanently lost due to private key loss [Research: Bitcoin Loss Statistics]; Social recovery wallets serve est. 50M+ users across implementations (ZenGo, Web3Auth, Magic, Dfns) [Market: Adoption Data]; Guardian collusion requires threshold (e.g., 3-of-5) coordination to execute recovery [Technical: Recovery Mechanism]; Time-locks (24-72h typical) provide user notification window before recovery completion [Implementation: Time-Lock Standards]; Vitalik Buterin advocated social recovery 2021 as crypto mainstream adoption path [Blog: Vitalik Social Recovery]; ERC-7093 proposes Ethereum standard for guardian-based recovery [Standard: ERC-7093 Draft]; ZenGo implements 2-of-3 recovery (device + server + cloud backup) [Product: ZenGo Architecture]; Web3Auth scales to 10M+ users with OAuth-based guardians [Growth: Web3Auth Statistics]; Argent pioneered social recovery 2018 with smart contract guardians and time-locks [Launch: Argent History]; Guardian notification commonly via email/SMS vulnerable to interception [Vulnerability: Notification Channels]; Multi-factor authentication for guardians improves security but reduces participation [Constraint: Usability Tradeoff]; No legal framework for guardianship fiduciary duties in most jurisdictions [Legal: Regulatory Gap]; Social engineering simulations show 40-60% success rate against non-technical guardians [Research: Phishing Effectiveness].
     - **Assumptions**: 50M+ social recovery wallet users (ZenGo 500K public, Web3Auth 10M public, Magic/Dfns several million estimated based on market presence and funding announcements); $5B+ assets under social recovery management (50M users × $100 avg retail holding, skewed by some high-value users); 200M+ designated guardians (50M users × 4 avg guardians); ~30% implementations require institutional guardian (survey of major providers: ZenGo yes, Web3Auth optional, Magic optional, Argent optional); ~20% implement strong multi-factor guardian authentication (hardware keys, biometric verification not widespread); <5% guardians receive security training (no provider offers comprehensive guardian education program as of 2025); <20% user comprehension of guardian trust model (inferred from wallet security surveys showing low understanding of recovery mechanisms); 40-60% unauthorized approval rate for social engineering (phishing simulation studies against non-technical participants extrapolated to guardian context); $1K-$100K+ per wallet for individual attack success (retail wallet typical holdings); $10M-$100M+ potential systematic campaign damage (1,000 users × $10K avg loss); $300K-$1M per-provider security upgrade costs (guardian authentication + training + legal + monitoring, based on typical security infrastructure project sizing); 24-72h median time-lock duration (Argent 3-5 days, newer wallets 24-48h for UX).
     - **Uncertainties**: Have any successful guardian collusion attacks occurred in wild? (No public reports, but would user disclose social circle betrayal? Detection difficult, on-chain evidence looks like legitimate recovery); What is actual guardian social engineering success rate? (40-60% estimate from academic phishing studies, but guardian context may differ—personal relationship increases skepticism or increases trust?); What percentage of users understand guardian trust model? (<20% estimate from general wallet security surveys, but no guardian-specific comprehension measurement published); What is optimal guardian threshold? (3-of-5 industry practice, but why not 2-of-3 or 5-of-9? No data on collusion probability vs. coordination difficulty tradeoff); Should institutional guardians be required? (Prevents pure personal collusion, but centralizes trust—optimal balance unknown); What are guardian relationship longevity statistics? (Divorce rate ~40% US, friend relationships volatile, business partnerships dissolve—how often do guardian relationships break down making recovery impossible?); What is legal liability for guardian negligent approval? (No case law, uncertain if guardian owes fiduciary duty, criminal vs. civil liability distinction unclear); Can court compel guardian cooperation in legitimate recovery? (Cryptographic key shares possibly not compellable under 5th Amendment self-incrimination, international enforcement impossible); What is time-lock effectiveness? (24-72h assumes user monitoring, but vacation/hospitalization/digital detox reduces detection rate—actual cancellation success percentage unknown); Will multi-factor guardian authentication reduce participation? (Hardware keys $50-$100 cost + setup friction may cause guardians to decline, reducing total guardian pool); What is optimal guardian diversity requirement? (No more than 50% from single family/entity? Geographic distribution required? Time-zone spread? Data-driven optimization missing); How will decentralized dispute resolution scale? (Kleros/Reality.eth handle small case volume, can they process thousands of guardianship disputes? Quality of arbitration?); Will insurance cover guardian attacks? (Policies may exclude "authorized" recovery since cryptographically valid, leaving users unprotected despite attack).

## Glossary

- **ERC-7093**: Proposed Ethereum standard for social recovery interface defining guardian management functions (addGuardian, removeGuardian, initiateRecovery, confirmRecovery, cancelRecovery) enabling cross-wallet interoperability.
- **Guardian**: Trusted individual or institution holding encrypted key share or approval authority to assist in wallet recovery if user loses primary device, typically 3-5 designated guardians per wallet.
- **Guardian collusion**: Attack where threshold majority of guardians (e.g., 3-of-5) coordinate to initiate unauthorized recovery and drain wallet funds without user consent.
- **Hybrid guardian model**: Recovery system combining personal guardians (friends, family) with institutional guardians (wallet provider, email service) to balance convenience, decentralization, and collusion resistance.
- **Seedless wallet**: MPC wallet eliminating seed phrase backup requirements by distributing key shares across multiple parties with social recovery as key reconstruction mechanism.
- **Social engineering against guardians**: Attack manipulating guardians through impersonation, urgency, or deception to approve unauthorized recovery request believing they're helping legitimate user.
- **Social recovery**: Wallet recovery mechanism distributing recovery authority among trusted guardians who can cooperatively reconstruct key shares to restore wallet access without seed phrase.
- **Threshold recovery**: Guardian-based recovery requiring m-of-n approvals (e.g., 3-of-5 guardians must agree) to execute wallet reconstruction, preventing single guardian compromise.
- **Time-lock delay**: Mandatory waiting period (24-72h typical) between recovery initiation and execution providing user notification window to cancel unauthorized recovery attempts.
