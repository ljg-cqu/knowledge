1. Q: Investigate the problem of high transaction signing latency and limited throughput in Blockchain MPC Wallets.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Blockchain MPC Wallets inherently experience higher transaction signing latency and limited throughput compared to traditional wallets due to complex multi-round communication protocols and network dependency. This problem hinders their suitability for high-frequency trading and other time-sensitive operations.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets split private keys into multiple shares, requiring multi-round cryptographic communication among parties during transaction signing. Network latency directly impacts signing speed, with operations typically taking 2-5 seconds for 2-of-2 configurations and 5-15 seconds for 3-of-5 deployments. Traditional hardware wallets, in contrast, sign almost instantly within 1-2 seconds once connected.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Reduce average transaction signing latency to under 2 seconds for 90% of operations. Increase transaction throughput to at least 50-100 transactions per minute for enterprise scenarios, aiming for stable performance even at scale.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: This is limited by the inherent network communication overhead, the requirement for all participating parties to be online and responsive during signing, and the computational complexity of the cryptographic protocols. Geographic distribution of key shares can also significantly impact performance.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Institutional traders and exchanges require low latency for high-frequency operations. End-users expect quick and smooth transactions, while wallet providers must balance security with performance requirements. Operational teams manage uptime and alerts related to signing operations.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is an immediate to medium-term issue impacting daily operations for millions of users globally and potentially billions of dollars in digital asset transactions. Addressing this is critical within the next 6-18 months to meet evolving market demands.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Protocols like GG18, GG20, and CGGMP21 have reduced communication rounds from nine to four, improving signing speed. Some advanced MPC wallets incorporate pre-processing techniques and microservices architectures to optimize computational throughput and scalability.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC protocols inherently involve multi-round communication and network dependency. Assumptions: Performance improvements are possible through protocol optimization and architectural enhancements. Uncertainties: The maximum achievable throughput and minimum latency without compromising security remain under study, especially under extreme load conditions.

2. Q: Investigate the problem of security vulnerabilities arising from insider threats and collusion risks in Blockchain MPC Wallets.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Despite eliminating single points of failure, Blockchain MPC Wallets introduce new security vulnerabilities such as collusion risks among key share holders and insider threats, which can lead to unauthorized transactions and asset loss. This undermines the distributed security model intended by MPC.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets distribute private key fragments across several parties or nodes, ensuring no single entity holds the full key. However, if a sufficient number of these parties (exceeding the threshold) are compromised or act maliciously in collusion, they can jointly reconstruct the private key or authorize unauthorized transactions. Insider threats, where employees or administrators abuse their access to key shares, are a significant concern for institutions.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Implement robust cryptographic and operational safeguards to prevent collusion-based compromises and insider threats. Detect and disincentivize collusive behavior with cryptographically verifiable audit trails. Achieve zero incidents of asset loss due to insider threat or collusion annually.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Limited by the cryptographic protocol design and trust assumptions about participants. Increasing the number of parties can improve security but may impact performance and coordination complexity. Robust governance models, continuous monitoring, and secure hardware are crucial.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Institutional users and asset managers are highly concerned with insider threats and ensuring fiduciary standards. Wallet providers are responsible for implementing secure infrastructure and governance policies. Security auditors and compliance officers play a critical role in assessing protocol robustness and policy adherence.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is an ongoing risk with immediate to long-term relevance, impacting millions of users and potentially billions of dollars in cryptocurrency holdings globally. Addressing this is critical for maintaining trust in digital asset custody.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: MPC wallets provide Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) and Distributed Key Generation (DKG). Policy-based transaction controls, role separation, and comprehensive audit trails help mitigate insider risks. Some MPC implementations focus on zero-trust and zero-knowledge gain principles among cosigners.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: The theoretical possibility and real-world risk of collusion and insider threats exist despite MPC's distributed nature. Assumptions: Robust governance models and stringent operational policies can significantly reduce these risks. Uncertainties: The effectiveness of novel detection methods for sophisticated collusion and evolving insider threat vectors remains a challenge.

3. Q: Examine the problem of complex and non-standardized backup and recovery mechanisms in Blockchain MPC Wallets impacting user experience and asset security.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Blockchain MPC Wallets suffer from complex and non-standardized backup and recovery mechanisms, posing significant usability challenges for end-users and increasing the risk of permanent asset loss or inaccessibility. Unlike traditional wallets, MPC wallets do not rely on a single seed phrase for recovery.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets distribute private key shares among multiple devices or parties, which eliminates single points of failure but complicates recovery if shares or devices are lost or compromised. Recovery often requires multi-party coordination and specific cryptographic protocols that can be intricate and vary significantly between providers. This technical complexity often leads to user confusion, delayed access, or even permanent loss of funds if recovery procedures are not meticulously followed or sufficient backup shares are not maintained.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Develop user-friendly and cryptographically robust recovery mechanisms that enable wallet restoration within one hour. Reduce recovery failure rates by at least 80% without compromising the wallet's security integrity. Achieve user satisfaction scores exceeding 90% regarding recovery ease.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Security requirements inherently restrict storing full private keys, meaning recovery must involve a threshold number of shares. Limited user technical proficiency and the diverse availability and trust among key share holders add to the complexity. Regulatory compliance and the need for scalable infrastructure for multi-party coordination are also significant constraints.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: End-users require accessible and reliable recovery options. Wallet providers must balance security with ease-of-use in their recovery solutions. Institutional users need robust asset recovery to meet fiduciary standards and business continuity requirements. Support teams bear the burden of assisting users with complex recovery procedures.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Recovery challenges impact critical user access events and institutional operations globally. Improving these mechanisms is crucial over the next 6-18 months to enhance user retention and safeguard billions in institutional assets.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Solutions include biometric authentication (e.g., ZenGo's face map), social recovery protocols where backup shares are distributed to trusted contacts, and encrypted offline backups. Ledger Recover uses a split data approach for backup. However, these approaches often introduce new complexities or trust assumptions.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC wallets fundamentally differ from traditional seed phrase-based recovery. Recovery processes are inherently more complex due to distributed shares. Assumptions: User education and intuitive UI/UX design can mitigate some of the complexity. Uncertainties: The optimal balance between security, user convenience, and long-term robustness across diverse loss and theft scenarios remains an open research area.

4. Q: Investigate the problem of dependence on centralized third-party providers in many Blockchain MPC Wallet implementations, posing trust and decentralization risks.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Many consumer-focused Blockchain MPC Wallets rely on third-party providers to hold one or more key shares, creating trust dependencies that can undermine decentralization and introduce risks of service outages, compromise, or mismanagement. This reliance deviates from the pure self-custody ideal of blockchain.
   - **Background and current situation**: While MPC technology aims to eliminate single points of failure by distributing key shares, many implementations, especially for retail users, allocate one key share to the wallet provider for convenience or recovery purposes. For example, ZenGo holds one key share on its secure servers, and Coinbase Wallet distributes shares between the user's device, Coinbase's infrastructure, and a backup service. This creates a critical dependency on the provider's availability, security, and integrity.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Minimize single-provider dependency to achieve greater decentralization, ensuring wallet access and recovery resilience even if a provider becomes unavailable or compromised. Target wallet availability of ≥99.9% and a recovery success rate of ≥99% without exclusive reliance on a single provider.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Balancing security and user convenience with trust assumptions is a primary constraint. The complexity of fully decentralized MPC implementations, which would require users to manage all shares across independent entities, can be a barrier for mass adoption. Regulatory policies also influence provider involvement.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Users who prioritize full self-sovereignty and decentralization are directly impacted by provider dependencies. Service providers balance usability and convenience with security architectures. Regulators may view provider involvement as a form of custody, impacting compliance.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: This issue has immediate to medium-term implications (6-12 months), affecting millions of users and institutions dependent on these centralized MPC services globally. It influences user trust and the philosophical alignment of MPC with blockchain's decentralization ethos.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some providers offer more distributed share models (e.g., 2-of-3 with a user device, provider, and backup service) to introduce redundancy. Decentralized MPC networks are being explored, such as Lit Protocol's approach where key shares are stored on network nodes.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Many current MPC wallet implementations involve a trusted third-party provider holding at least one key share. Assumptions: Users are willing to trade some decentralization for convenience and managed recovery options. Uncertainties: The long-term viability and adoption rate of fully decentralized MPC deployments, and how regulations will evolve concerning these trust models.

5. Q: Investigate the challenges in achieving regulatory compliance for Blockchain MPC Wallet usage due to off-chain signing and privacy features.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The off-chain signing and privacy-preserving nature of Blockchain MPC Wallets obscure transaction auditability and participant identities, creating significant compliance challenges in regulated environments. This complicates adherence to KYC/AML obligations and transparency demands.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets perform transaction signing off-chain, and only the final signature is submitted to the blockchain. This process inherently hides the individual signing steps, participant identities, and the internal approval mechanisms from on-chain visibility. Regulators, however, typically require transparent transaction trails, verifiable participant identities (KYC/AML), and robust audit logs to prevent illicit activities and ensure accountability. The conflict between MPC's privacy features and regulatory demands poses a critical challenge for institutional adoption.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Ensure full compliance with KYC/AML, data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR), and audit requirements across major jurisdictions. Achieve this without compromising the core security and privacy benefits of MPC. Success is measured by obtaining relevant certifications (e.g., SOC 2 Type II), passing compliance audits without findings, and maintaining user data privacy.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: The inherent privacy protections of MPC protocols clash with demands for transparency. Different jurisdictions (e.g., US, EU, APAC) have fragmented and evolving regulatory frameworks. Implementing automated reporting, integrating identity verification layers, and balancing data minimization with compliance requirements are complex.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Compliance officers and legal teams must navigate complex legal frameworks. Regulatory bodies (e.g., FinCEN, SEC, MiCA) define and enforce standards. Institutional clients require MPC solutions that meet stringent compliance standards for their operations. Wallet providers must design systems that can reconcile privacy with regulatory mandates.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is an ongoing and evolving challenge, with significant impact on institutional adoption and market access for MPC wallets over the next 1-3 years globally.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some MPC providers offer features like auditable access logs and policy-based transaction controls. MPC solutions can be designed to align with compliance by ensuring that user identities can be tied to access policies off-chain and by generating cryptographically verifiable audit trails.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC wallets reduce on-chain visibility of signing processes. Regulatory bodies are increasing scrutiny on digital asset activities. Assumptions: Cryptographic audit proofs and off-chain attestation mechanisms can satisfy regulatory requirements. Uncertainties: The precise interpretation of MPC wallets within future regulatory frameworks and the degree of transparency regulators will ultimately demand remain unclear.

6. Q: Examine the problem of scalability and performance limitations of Blockchain MPC Wallets for high-frequency and DeFi applications.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Blockchain MPC Wallets currently cannot efficiently batch multiple transactions or implement complex programmable logic on-chain, limiting their suitability for high-frequency trading and sophisticated DeFi operations. This restricts their utility compared to smart contract-based wallets.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets sign individual transactions through multi-round cryptographic protocols, which, while secure, introduce inherent latency and computational overhead. Unlike smart contract wallets, which can support complex conditional logic, spending limits, and transaction batching directly on-chain, MPC wallets generate standard transactions that appear indistinguishable from single-signature transactions, thus lacking this advanced functionality.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Achieve transaction throughput of several hundred transactions per minute, enabling efficient batching and support for complex, conditional transactions. This should be achieved without compromising security or significantly increasing operational costs.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: This is constrained by the inherent design of MPC protocols requiring multi-round communication for each signature, network latency, and the limitations of blockchain protocols for verifying off-chain logic. The current architecture is not optimized for scenarios requiring automated, high-volume, or intricate on-chain interactions.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Institutional traders and market makers require extremely low latency and high throughput for high-frequency strategies. DeFi protocol users and developers need programmable logic for advanced financial operations and efficient batching to save on gas fees. Wallet developers are challenged to bridge the gap between MPC's cryptographic strengths and the functional demands of these advanced use cases.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is a medium to long-term challenge (6 months to 2 years), significantly impacting the adoption of MPC wallets in fast-paced financial sectors and the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Hybrid wallet architectures are emerging, which attempt to combine MPC's privacy and efficiency with the flexibility of smart contract wallets. Projects exploring account abstraction (ERC-4337) and keystore-based wallets aim to provide complex access policies and batching capabilities with minimal on-chain footprint.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC protocols, in their current form, are not designed for native on-chain programmability or batching. Smart contract wallets excel in these areas but incur higher gas costs. Assumptions: Emerging hybrid designs will effectively address these functional deficits without introducing new security vulnerabilities. Uncertainties: The timeline for maturity, user adoption, and ecosystem integration of these advanced hybrid solutions remains uncertain.

7. Q: Examine the problem of high Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and operational complexity in enterprise-scale Blockchain MPC Wallet deployments.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Enterprise-scale deployment of Blockchain MPC Wallets involves significant Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and operational complexity due to substantial development effort, stringent compliance audits, extensive training requirements, and ongoing operational expenditure. This can deter adoption despite security benefits.
   - **Background and current situation**: While MPC wallets offer institutional-grade security, their implementation at an enterprise level requires a multi-month project encompassing detailed planning, API integration, key ceremony planning, share distribution setup, and potentially Hardware Security Module (HSM) configuration. Integrations typically demand 40-200 engineering hours, security audits can cost $10,000-$50,000, and training teams can consume 20-100 hours. These hidden costs often exceed initial subscription fees.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Reduce the TCO by at least 30% through streamlined processes, efficient architectures, and comprehensive tooling. Shorten deployment timelines to a maximum of 6 months for typical enterprise solutions, while maintaining rigorous security and compliance standards.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include the need for highly skilled personnel with expertise in advanced cryptography and distributed systems. Compliance certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) are mandatory for institutional players, adding to both cost and complexity. Balancing these requirements with budget limitations and operational flexibility presents a significant challenge.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: IT and development teams face high engineering demands and integration complexities. Compliance officers manage audit processes and regulatory adherence. Enterprise management allocates significant budget and resources, expecting a clear ROI and operational efficiency. Wallet providers must offer robust support, clear documentation, and efficient SDKs to mitigate client-side complexity.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Enterprise MPC deployments typically span 2-4 months for initial rollout, but the TCO and operational complexity have a continuous impact over years on institutional clients globally. This problem affects thousands of institutional users and organizations managing billions in assets.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) providers aim to reduce operational overhead by offering managed solutions. Fireblocks and Copper provide enterprise-grade solutions with comprehensive support, but their pricing reflects the underlying complexity. Optimized SDKs and APIs from developer platforms like Web3Auth and Lit Protocol seek to simplify integration.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC wallet deployment for enterprises is resource-intensive and complex. Hidden costs often exceed visible subscription fees. Assumptions: Improved tooling, standardization, and vendor support can reduce TCO and streamline deployment. Uncertainties: The pace at which these complexities can be reduced without compromising critical security and compliance requirements remains a key unknown.

8. Q: Investigate the problem of limited interoperability of Blockchain MPC Wallets with diverse blockchain networks, other wallet types, and DeFi protocols.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Blockchain MPC Wallets face significant interoperability challenges, hindering seamless interaction with various blockchain networks, other wallet types (e.g., hardware, traditional single-key), and DeFi protocols. This limits their overall usability and adoption across the broader crypto ecosystem.
   - **Background and current situation**: MPC wallets operate at the cryptographic layer, enabling them to generate standard signatures (like ECDSA or EdDSA) that are compatible with most blockchains. However, while they can support all digital assets on a specific network, integration with existing hardware wallets can be challenging due to the absence of a single seed phrase. Unlike multisig wallets which rely on on-chain smart contracts and explicit protocol support, MPC operates off-chain, making its internal processes invisible. This distinction can lead to difficulties in interacting with DeFi protocols that rely on on-chain logic or specific smart contract functionalities.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Achieve robust interoperability, allowing MPC wallets to seamlessly interact with at least 90% of major blockchain networks, all widely used wallet types, and prevalent DeFi protocols within 18 months. Success will be measured by a significant reduction (e.g., >80%) in transaction failures due to interoperability issues and increased user engagement across multi-chain and DeFi platforms.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include the diverse cryptographic signature schemes across different blockchains, the absence of universal open standards for MPC wallet implementations, and the varying smart contract capabilities of different networks. Development complexity, the need for extensive API/SDK integrations, and the continuous evolution of blockchain and DeFi standards require substantial resources.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: End-users expect seamless access to a wide range of digital assets and DeFi services across multiple chains without needing different wallets. Wallet developers face the challenge of building flexible and compatible infrastructure. Institutional clients require unified custody solutions that can manage assets across diverse ecosystems. Blockchain protocol developers must consider wallet compatibility when designing new standards.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Interoperability is a continuous development challenge. Focused efforts over the next 12-18 months can significantly enhance user experience for millions of users engaged in multi-chain and DeFi activities, unlocking greater liquidity and market potential.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: MPC wallets inherently offer "blockchain-agnostic" compatibility at the signature level. Some providers like Coinbase Wallet and Fireblocks support multiple asset types and chains within their MPC frameworks. Hybrid wallet architectures combining MPC with smart contracts are emerging to address the limitations in complex logic and batching.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC wallets generate standard signatures, making them broadly compatible at a basic level. However, deeper integration for advanced DeFi functions or specific wallet types remains challenging. Assumptions: User demand for seamless multi-chain and DeFi experiences will drive the development of more interoperable MPC solutions. Uncertainties: The pace of standardization in both MPC and blockchain ecosystems, and the effectiveness of emerging hybrid architectures in solving these complex interoperability challenges.
