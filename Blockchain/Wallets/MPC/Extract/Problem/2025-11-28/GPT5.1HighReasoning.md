1. Q: For an institutional multi-chain MPC wallet that must secure high-value assets across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The team must design a production-grade MPC wallet architecture that eliminates any single point of key compromise while keeping signing latency under roughly 2 seconds P95 for mobile and API clients, and supporting the addition of new chains in weeks instead of months, without creating an un-auditable tangle of chain-specific logic inside the cryptographic core.
   - **Background and current situation**: Today, custody flows are split between single-sig or HSM-based systems and ad-hoc per-chain wallet code; key management, MPC protocols, and transaction-building logic are tightly coupled, making it difficult to reason about security boundaries, onboard new chains, or pass rigorous third-party audits for large institutional clients holding on the order of $50M–$500M in assets.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The organization needs an architecture with clearly separated MPC core, coordinator, and transaction services that can demonstrate no single server or device can reconstruct the key, achieve end-to-end signing latency below about 2 seconds P95 and failure rates below ~1–2% for normal network conditions, and reduce marginal engineering effort for a new ECDSA/EdDSA chain integration to <40–80 engineering hours while passing security reviews with zero critical findings.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include a small 5–8 person engineering team, a 6–12 month delivery window for the first three chains, requirements for SOC 2–style auditability, existing investments in Rust/Go microservices and Kafka-like brokers, and the need to operate across multiple regions with commodity cloud infrastructure.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include security and cryptography engineers who own MPC correctness, backend and SRE teams responsible for uptime and incident response, product and custody-ops teams defining workflows and SLAs, compliance officers concerned with control separation and audit trails, and institutional clients who require clear assurances on blast radius and recovery procedures.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Architectural decisions made in the next 6–12 months are expected to hold for at least 3–5 years, affecting all custody flows across three or more major chains, tens of thousands of daily active addresses, and assets that may grow into the high hundreds of millions of dollars; a flawed design could make later protocol changes or jurisdictional moves prohibitively expensive.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The team has experimented with prototypes that embed MPC logic directly into blockchain-specific services and previously relied on HSM-backed single-sig or on-chain multisig for some flows, but has not yet converged on a clean separation between MPC core, orchestration, and transaction services that scales to many chains while remaining testable and auditable.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Existing single-sig and monolithic designs are operational but hard to extend and audit; reference architectures such as hexagonal ports-and-adapters and message-broker-based MPC clusters are known patterns with measured trade-offs in latency and complexity. Assumptions: Future growth will require adding several more chains and protocols, and auditors will expect clear boundaries around key material and signing responsibilities. Uncertainties: Exact traffic growth, which chains and signature schemes will dominate over 3–5 years, and how much performance overhead can be tolerated by users and regulators when additional isolation layers are introduced.

1. Q: For a multi-chain MPC wallet that must choose and evolve its threshold-signature protocol portfolio across ECDSA (secp256k1), EdDSA (ed25519), and potentially BLS-based chains, formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The organization must decide which threshold protocols (e.g., GG18/GG20-style ECDSA, FROST-style Schnorr/EdDSA, two-party DKLS variants, or threshold BLS) to standardize on per curve and chain so that latency, auditability, and implementation complexity remain acceptable while achieving broad chain coverage and avoiding frequent, risky replatforming.
   - **Background and current situation**: Current experiments and literature show that GG20-like ECDSA protocols are battle-tested but involve 5–8 communication rounds and higher latency, while FROST-like schemes offer 2-round online signing with significantly lower latency but less long-term production history, and some mobile deployments are already struggling with ~300ms+ cryptographic latency per signing round and multi-round network churn.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The team needs a protocol roadmap that covers at least the top 3–5 target chains within 12–18 months, delivers end-to-end signing under roughly 1.5–2 seconds P95 on mobile for common paths, keeps protocol-level security at 128-bit strength with tolerance for up to t−1 corrupted parties, and limits major protocol migrations (e.g., GG20 → FROST) to at most one or two controlled events over a 3–5 year horizon.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include limited in-house formal-cryptography capacity (e.g., 2–3 specialists), dependence on external open-source libraries and audits, regulatory expectations that production-signing protocols be well-documented and independently reviewed, and the need to support both high-frequency mobile use cases and slower institutional back-office flows on the same platform.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Cryptography and security teams are accountable for protocol choice and residual risk; mobile and backend engineers must implement and maintain protocol code under performance targets; product and business teams care about which chains and features can be promised to customers; auditors and regulators scrutinize protocol maturity; and end clients bear the ultimate risk of key compromise or signing outages.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Decisions made in the next 3–9 months will determine protocol choices for at least 2–4 years of production operation, affecting latency and risk for thousands to millions of signatures per day across multiple chains and devices; a misstep could require emergency migrations of all keys and flows or constrain which markets can be served.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The team has so far prototyped GG20-based ECDSA signing for Bitcoin/EVM and considered ed25519-based Threshold EdDSA or FROST for Solana-like chains, but has not yet run full production pilots or formalized migration criteria (e.g., number of independent audits, months of field experience) to move from older to newer protocols.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Protocols such as GG18/GG20 and FROST have published papers and reference implementations with indicative latency and round counts; mobile network conditions often dominate perceived signing delay; and some institutional custodians already use threshold ECDSA in production. Assumptions: Future chains of interest will continue to rely on ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS families and will accept standard signature encodings; protocol audits and standardization (e.g., RFCs) will progress over the next 1–2 years. Uncertainties: The pace at which newer schemes become de facto standards, the discovery of vulnerabilities, and how regulators will evaluate newer threshold protocols versus conservative HSM-based models.

1. Q: In the MPC wallet’s mobile client flows, current 3-of-5 threshold signing exhibits around 3.5 seconds P95 latency and roughly 15% failure rate on 4G networks; formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The team must reduce mobile end-to-end signing latency and failure rates to levels acceptable for consumer and prosumer users (e.g., <1.5 seconds P95 and <2% failures) without weakening cryptographic security guarantees or over-provisioning infrastructure to an unsustainable level.
   - **Background and current situation**: Profiling has indicated that approximately 60% of the current latency budget is consumed by multi-round threshold ECDSA network trips, about 25% by on-device cryptographic computations, and around 15% by serialization and transport overhead; users frequently abandon flows or retry transactions, and support tickets cite “wallet feels slow or unreliable” as a major complaint.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The concrete target is to cut P95 signing latency from ~3.5 seconds to under ~1.5 seconds on typical 4G/5G connections, bring failure and timeout rates below about 1–2%, maintain at least 128-bit equivalent security, and avoid increasing mobile CPU or battery usage by more than, say, 20–30% relative to today.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include limited ability to change L1/L2 confirmation rules, a shared MPC signing backend that must also serve institutional API flows, budget limits on deploying globally distributed coordinators, and the need to keep mobile SDK size and memory footprint within platform app-store and device constraints.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Mobile engineers responsible for client SDKs and UI, backend and SRE teams operating MPC clusters and edge infrastructure, cryptography engineers guarding protocol safety, product managers tracking conversion funnels, and end users who care primarily about perceived speed and reliability are all directly affected by performance trade-offs.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The desired improvements are expected within 3–9 months and will influence daily experience for tens or hundreds of thousands of mobile users, materially affecting activation, transaction frequency, and retention, as well as operational load and cost profiles on the MPC backend.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Past optimizations have primarily focused on incremental code-level tuning and caching, with limited experiments around protocol changes or precomputation; some potential levers such as protocol substitution (e.g., FROST-style schemes), pre-generated nonces, or regional coordinators have been discussed but not comprehensively evaluated.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Current latency and error metrics are measured in production, and network RTT dominates the slow tail; academic and industry reports suggest 2-round protocols and precomputation can significantly reduce online signing time. Assumptions: Users are sensitive to delays above ~2 seconds and to repeated failures, and the business is willing to invest in some infra changes if benefits are clear. Uncertainties: The exact impact of different optimization strategies in this specific environment, and whether any chosen changes might subtly undermine protocol assumptions or introduce new operational failure modes.

1. Q: For institutional MPC wallet deployments that rely on fine-grained, policy-driven approvals (per asset, desk, risk score), formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The organization must design and calibrate a policy and approval engine so that it meaningfully reduces fraud and operational risk without causing alert fatigue, rubber-stamping, or parallel shadow workflows that bypass MPC controls.
   - **Background and current situation**: Current or planned designs map transaction attributes (amount, asset, counterparty, initiator, time, historical behavior) to required quorums and rate limits, but many existing financial systems show that poorly tuned rules and noisy alerts lead approvers to click through prompts mechanically or to move urgent flows off the controlled system; institutional clients expect both strong controls and smooth operations.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: Success would mean that high-risk or unusual transactions are reliably escalated to stronger quorums within acceptable approval times (e.g., median decision time per risk band kept within agreed SLAs), the false-positive block rate stays below an agreed threshold (e.g., <1–3% of legitimate attempts), and the majority of operational volume remains within policy-driven MPC flows rather than exception paths.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include limited UX budget for complex approval interfaces, diverse risk appetites across clients and desks, the need to express policies in a way auditors can understand and test, and the difficulty of running controlled experiments on real high-value flows without exposing clients to excessive friction or risk.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Custody ops teams executing approvals, risk and compliance teams defining policy templates, security and MPC engineers implementing enforcement mechanisms, product managers balancing UX and safety, auditors reviewing configurations, and institutional account owners who ultimately bear loss and SLA impacts are all key stakeholders.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Policy engine decisions will influence all high-value flows over multi-year horizons, with immediate effects on daily approval workload, incident frequency, and customer satisfaction across portfolios that can range from tens of millions to billions of dollars in assets under management.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Other internal systems and external custodians provide examples of coarse-grained limits, static whitelists, and manual overrides, some of which have led to either breaches or chronic workarounds; in the MPC wallet, a preliminary ruleset may already exist but has not been stress-tested under sustained growth or unusual market conditions.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Human approvers are subject to cognitive overload and will adapt behavior to perceived urgency signals and queue design; previous mechanism analyses show clear feedback loops between false-positive rates, behavior, and retention. Assumptions: Institutions will accept some friction in exchange for markedly reduced fraud or operational errors. Uncertainties: The precise trade-off curves between stricter policies, throughput, and satisfaction for different client segments, and how to measure “good enough” safety without waiting for major incidents.

1. Q: When some MPC key-share holders are offline or suspected compromised, formulate a structured problem statement around how the wallet should balance signing liveness against preservation of effective corruption thresholds.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The platform must decide how and when to adjust quorums, route around failing domains, or temporarily pause signing so that critical flows can continue under partial failures without silently weakening security guarantees to an unacceptable level.
   - **Background and current situation**: Production deployments often use configurations such as 3-of-5 or 4-of-7 across heterogeneous domains (HSM clusters, cloud enclaves, user devices), and real incidents (network partitions, maintenance, suspicious telemetry) can leave parts of the quorum unavailable; some stakeholders push for automatic failover to keep flows moving, while others are concerned about reducing the effective number of independent compromises required to drain funds.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The system needs explicit policies and mechanisms that define acceptable degraded modes (e.g., which asset tiers, values, or client types may use reduced quorums), target bounds on time spent in degraded state (e.g., <X hours per month), and measurable limits on the share of total notional volume executed under weakened thresholds, while ensuring incident detection and rotation procedures are triggered promptly.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include regulatory and internal-policy requirements around minimum key-holder diversity, the complexity and risk of implementing dynamic quorum management in MPC protocols, operational limits on how quickly compromised or offline nodes can be investigated or rotated, and customer intolerance for both prolonged downtime and opaque risk changes.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Security architects designing quorum and failover rules, SRE and operations teams monitoring health and managing incidents, risk and compliance officers defining acceptable degraded-state behavior, product teams promising availability SLAs, and institutional clients whose capital is directly affected by both outages and potential theft all have competing priorities.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Liveness and failover policies will be exercised repeatedly over the system’s lifetime, often under market stress, and can affect all flows in particular asset tiers or geographies; a single flawed policy decision could enable a catastrophic drain or, conversely, multi-hour signing outages during critical windows.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some previous designs in other systems have used fixed thresholds with manual emergency procedures; in the MPC wallet, initial designs may include ad-hoc overrides or undocumented practices to “temporarily relax” quorums for important trades, but without formal risk analysis or consistent logging.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC protocols and prior mechanism work highlight a clear liveness–security trade-off, and there are known examples of both overly conservative and overly permissive failover policies. Assumptions: System health telemetry and anomaly detection can reliably flag problematic nodes or domains. Uncertainties: The real-world frequency and clustering of failures, human behavior under pressure, and how regulators and clients will retrospectively assess decisions made during degraded periods.

1. Q: For institutional clients currently using single-sig or HSM-based custody, formulate a structured problem statement around safely migrating assets and workflows into the MPC wallet without disrupting operations or eroding trust.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The custody provider needs a migration mechanism that moves existing clients’ assets, policies, and operational runbooks into MPC-based key management in a way that minimizes service interruptions and perceived risk, while providing clear rollback paths if issues arise.
   - **Background and current situation**: Many target clients already operate mature HSM or multisig setups with their own approval processes, audit trails, and regulator familiarity; previous technology migrations in finance have sometimes failed because cutovers were too abrupt or shadow systems had to be run indefinitely, leading to duplicated controls and confusion.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The migration program should aim to move a high percentage of existing assets (e.g., >70–80% of balances and flows) into MPC within a defined period such as 12–24 months, keep incident rates during migration below baseline levels, maintain auditor and regulator confidence, and shorten typical proof-of-concept-to-full-migration timelines from many months to something like 6–12 weeks per client.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include limited implementation and onboarding capacity, clients’ own change-management and governance processes, potential vendor lock-in concerns, compatibility issues between legacy and MPC policy models, and the need to avoid dual-control setups that are so complex that nobody clearly understands who is responsible for what.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Sales and account teams managing relationships and expectations, solution architects and engineers designing migration playbooks, custody ops executing dual-run or shadow-mode procedures, risk and compliance teams validating that controls remain effective, and client-side security and operations teams who must sign off on the new model are all deeply involved.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: Migration decisions and their execution will typically span 6–24 months per major client, affecting large asset books and daily workflows; a failed or mishandled migration can permanently damage trust, result in lost business, or trigger regulatory scrutiny.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some early pilots may have used ad-hoc migration scripts or manual key-move procedures with small clients; external case studies from other providers suggest phased “shadow mode” and hybrid setups, but the organization has not yet codified a standard, repeatable migration mechanism with agreed risk thresholds and rollback criteria.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Legacy systems are functioning today but do not offer the same flexibility or UX as MPC; mechanism analyses indicate that carefully staged migrations can improve retention and growth. Assumptions: Most institutions are willing to adopt MPC if risk is clearly lower and operational disruption is controlled. Uncertainties: The actual appetite for change among different client segments, hidden dependencies in legacy setups that may surface during migration, and how many parallel migrations the organization can safely run.

1. Q: In the event that one or more MPC share-holding servers are compromised or suspected to be compromised, formulate a structured problem statement covering incident response, share rotation, and regulatory communication for the MPC wallet.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The organization must be able to detect, analyze, and respond to partial key-share exposure events in a way that prevents full key reconstruction or unauthorized signing, while meeting strict timelines for service restoration and regulatory or contractual notifications.
   - **Background and current situation**: Scenario analyses and industry incidents show that attackers may exfiltrate memory or disk snapshots from MPC nodes without immediately triggering fraud, leaving teams uncertain about whether keys are at risk; in regulated environments, there are obligations to notify auditors and data-protection authorities within set windows (e.g., 72 hours) even when funds have not yet moved.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The incident-management design should enable containment and share rotation within tight time bounds (e.g., containment within <1–2 hours of detection, rotation completed within <4–8 hours for affected clusters), maintain or rapidly restore signing for unaffected asset tiers, keep realized losses at zero or within predefined tolerances, and ensure that all required regulators, clients, and auditors are informed accurately and on time.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include the complexity and runtime of distributed key refresh or proactive secret-sharing protocols, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities during emergency procedures, limited on-call and forensic capacity, and fixed external timelines for formal reports under frameworks such as SOC 2 or GDPR-like regimes.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Security operations and incident-response teams, cryptographers designing refresh and rotation mechanisms, SREs and backend engineers executing isolation and redeployment steps, compliance and legal teams managing notifications and documentation, and clients whose assets and trust are at stake all participate in incident handling.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: While individual incidents unfold over hours to days, the design of runbooks, monitoring, and rotation mechanisms must support years of continuous operation; a single mishandled event could lead to permanent reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, or large client departures even if no immediate theft occurred.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The organization may already have generic security incident response procedures and partial runbooks for restarting MPC clusters, but has not yet fully specified or tested end-to-end flows for partial share exposure, including dual-key periods, staged refresh, or communication templates for different severity levels.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Existing MPC and PSS literature provides building blocks for share refresh without full key reconstruction, and regulatory frameworks specify some notification deadlines. Assumptions: Continuous monitoring can detect most significant compromises in time to act, and clients will judge the response as much as the incident itself. Uncertainties: The real-world detectability of advanced intrusions, how often hardware or cloud providers may be involved, and how regulators will interpret partial-share vs full-key exposure.

1. Q: As the MPC wallet platform is turned into an external developer SDK and service for third parties (exchanges, DeFi protocols, startups), formulate a structured problem statement around SDK design, security tiers, and monetization for the wallet.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The company needs to package its MPC wallet capabilities into an SDK and service offering with clear security guarantees, integration paths, and pricing models so that external teams can adopt it quickly without unintentionally weakening their security posture or making the economics unworkable.
   - **Background and current situation**: Internal MPC infrastructure was originally built for a single custody product; now there is pressure to expose it as a general SDK to multiple segments (e.g., institutional custody, DeFi protocols, early-stage apps) that have very different AUM, integration capabilities, and tolerance for audits or customizations, and past observations indicate that poorly aligned pricing (e.g., high per-signature charges) can drive risky behavior or low adoption.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The SDK and service should enable typical startup teams to integrate core flows in under about one week, institutional clients to meet stringent audit and compliance requirements, and the business to reach targeted revenue and adoption metrics (for example, hundreds or thousands of active developers and several million dollars of ARR within 1–2 years) without incentivizing clients to bypass security features to save cost.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include limited documentation and developer-relations bandwidth, the need to maintain strict separation between tenants and use cases inside shared MPC infrastructure, finite capacity for custom features or audits per client, and the challenge of designing pricing that works for both small and very large AUM without constant bespoke negotiation.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Platform and SDK engineers, security architects, product and business owners, sales and account teams, external developer teams integrating the SDK, and their security and compliance counterparts all have different priorities regarding safety, ease of use, and commercial terms.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: SDK design and pricing decisions made now will influence the platform’s ecosystem and revenue mix over at least 2–4 years, affecting potentially dozens to hundreds of partner projects and indirectly the security of end users whose assets depend on correct integration and operation.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Some early partners may have been onboarded through bespoke integrations and ad-hoc APIs, and competing MPC providers already offer a mix of proprietary and open-source SDKs with varying pricing models; however, the organization has not yet systematized tiered offerings, security levels, or developer experience patterns across segments.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Prior mechanism analyses show that monetization models can strongly influence how often MPC is used versus alternative flows, and integration friction correlates with drop-off rates. Assumptions: A well-designed SDK with clear guarantees and commercial terms can become a growth flywheel for the core platform. Uncertainties: How many segments can realistically be served with one product line, which pricing structures (e.g., per-sign, AUM-based, hybrid) the market will accept, and how competing offerings will evolve.
