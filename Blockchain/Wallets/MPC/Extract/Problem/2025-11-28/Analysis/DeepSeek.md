## Problem 1 – Latency in MPC Key Generation and Signing

### 1. Problem Definition (Aspect 1)

- **1.1 Problem and contradictions**
  - Core contradiction: stronger security via MPC (multi-round, multi-party protocols) vs. the need for low-latency signing for time-sensitive transactions.
  - Tension between: cryptographic rigor and round complexity, network conditions, and user expectations shaped by near-instant hot wallets / CEX experiences.
  - Conflict across parties: end-users and trading platforms want sub-second latency; protocol designers insist on conservative round counts and parameter choices.
- **1.2 Goals and conditions**
  - Target: ≤2s latency for 99% of signatures (ideal: sub-1s), with no meaningful reduction in security level.
  - Hard conditions: keep existing MPC trust model (no single point of compromise), work within realistic internet latencies and commodity hardware.
  - Soft conditions: acceptable engineering complexity, maintainability, and cost per transaction.
- **1.3 Extensibility and reframing**
  - One object, many attributes: latency decomposed into protocol rounds, per-round compute time, network RTT, queuing, and batching policies.
  - One attribute, many objects: the same latency problem appears in key generation, presigning, online signing, and recovery flows.
  - Reframe from "reduce total latency" to:
    - Move as much work as possible to **offline presigning / precomputation**.
    - Reduce **tail latency** (p99) via routing, redundancy, and adaptive quorum selection.
    - Segment users and flows (retail vs. HFT vs. cold moves) with different latency–risk trade-offs.

### 2. Internal Logical Relations (Aspect 2)

- **2.1 Key elements inside the problem**
  - MPC protocol parameters: threshold `t`, party count `n`, round structure, cryptographic primitives.
  - System architecture: number and location of signing nodes, load balancers, presignature pools, queues.
  - Operational policies: rate limits, batching, timeouts, fallback paths (e.g., using a different quorum).
- **2.2 Balance and "degree"**
  - Security vs. speed: fewer rounds or fewer parties improve latency but lower security / robustness.
  - Online vs. offline work: more presigning lowers online latency but increases storage, complexity, and precomputation load.
  - Tail vs. average: optimizing mean latency alone can hide long tails that matter for trading.
- **2.3 Key internal causal chains**
  - More parties → higher probability some are slow/unreachable → more retries / timeouts → higher p95/p99 latency.
  - Under-provisioned presignature pool → queue buildup at peak → users experience sporadic long delays → perceived unreliability and churn.
  - Poor observability → slow detection of bottlenecks → long periods of degraded performance.

### 3. External Connections (Aspect 3)

- **3.1 Stakeholders**
  - **End-users / traders**: care about confirmation speed and predictability; blame the wallet if slow.
  - **Exchanges / DeFi integrators**: need predictable signing latency for order routing and risk controls.
  - **Protocol / security teams**: accountable for not weakening security; wary of aggressive shortcuts.
  - **Business owners**: weigh performance investment vs. user growth / retention impact.
- **3.2 Environment and institutions**
  - Network environment: cross-region RTT, mobile vs. wired, cloud vs. on-prem nodes.
  - Blockchain environment: L1/L2 confirmation times, mempool behavior; wallet latency compounds with chain latency.
  - Institutional requirements: SLA commitments in contracts; incident-report expectations from partners.
- **3.3 Responsibility and room to maneuver**
  - The MPC wallet provider owns protocol choice, deployment topology, and observability.
  - Integrators can adapt their UX (e.g., optimistic UI, async flows) but cannot fix protocol-level latency.
  - Room to maneuver mostly lies in **architecture, precomputation strategy, and routing**, not in relaxing security guarantees.

### 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

- **4.1 Key historical nodes**
  - Early MPC research prioritized security correctness over latency and operational practicality.
  - First production MPC wallets reused academic protocols with minimal optimization and limited presigning.
  - Growth in user bases and HFT / institutional use exposed tail-latency problems and UX friction.
- **4.2 Background vs. direct causes**
  - Background: cryptography community culture (safety-first, theoretical security); distributed systems challenges.
  - Direct causes: conservative default parameters, minimal regional redundancy, lack of latency SLOs and profiling.
- **4.3 Deep structural issues**
  - Security / cryptography and SRE / performance engineering operate in silos, leading to suboptimal joint design.
  - Lack of standard performance benchmarks for MPC wallets; decisions often made qualitatively.

### 5. Problem Trends (Aspect 5)

- **5.1 Current trend judgment**
  - Without focused optimization, MPC wallets remain perceived as "secure but sluggish", limiting adoption in trading-heavy use cases.
- **5.2 Early signals and "spots"**
  - Complaints about "spinning" signing screens and failed market orders at volatile times.
  - Internal metrics showing high p95/p99 latency when one region or cloud AZ has transient issues.
- **5.3 Possible scenarios (6–24 months)**
  - **Optimistic**: Protocol-level presigning + smart routing + regional deployment deliver p99 <2s; MPC wallets become viable for active traders.
  - **Baseline**: Mixed experience; some flows optimized, others remain slow, restricting MPC wallets to medium-frequency usage.
  - **Pessimistic**: Latency remains >5s at peak; users avoid MPC wallets for trading and only use them as slow, secure vaults.

### 6. Capability Reserves (Aspect 6)

- **6.1 Existing capabilities**
  - Strong cryptography and protocol expertise; ability to choose and implement modern schemes.
  - Experience running distributed wallet infrastructure and monitoring basic uptime.
- **6.2 Capability gaps**
  - Deep performance engineering across network, protocol, and application layers.
  - Rigorous SLO/SLA-driven operations (defining and enforcing latency budgets per component).
- **6.3 Capabilities to build (1–6 months)**
  - Hire or develop SREs and performance engineers with experience in low-latency systems.
  - Build a benchmarking and load-testing framework specific to MPC signing pipelines.

### 7. Analysis Outline (Aspect 7)

- **7.1 Structured outline (bullet level)**
  - Background: MPC adds communication rounds and parties → higher latency.
  - Problem: current end-to-end latency (esp. tail) breaks UX and trading requirements.
  - Analysis: decompose latency; identify protocol vs. infra vs. policy contributions.
  - Options: protocol optimization, presigning, infra/routing, UX adjustments.
  - Risks & follow-ups: security regressions, complexity explosion, partial optimizations.
- **7.2 Key judgments to validate**
  - Users will materially increase adoption if p99 signing latency drops below ~2s.
  - Most latency can be reduced via **architecture and precomputation** without sacrificing security.
  - Tail latency, not mean latency, drives perceived quality for trading use cases.
- **7.3 Alternative paths (high level)**
  - Path A: Aggressively optimize existing protocol (more presigning, better routing) without changing primitives.
  - Path B: Migrate to a newer, fewer-round threshold scheme with similar security assurances.
  - Path C: Segment products (fast but slightly weaker security tier vs. ultra-secure slower tier).

### 8. Validating the Answer (Aspect 8)

- **8.1 Potential biases**
  - Engineering bias to overestimate the value of small latency wins vs. protocol-switching cost.
  - Security bias to reject any protocol or infra change that feels "new", even if audited.
- **8.2 Required intelligence and feedback**
  - Detailed latency breakdowns (per-step histograms) for key flows.
  - User behavior data: drop-offs vs. latency buckets; conversion rates by signing time.
  - Independent security reviews of candidate low-round protocols.
- **8.3 Validation plan**
  - Run controlled experiments comparing current vs. optimized pipeline on a subset of traffic.
  - Correlate UX metrics (e.g., completed trades) with measured signing latency.

### 9. Revising the Answer (Aspect 9)

- **9.1 Parts likely to be revised**
  - Assumptions about acceptable security–latency trade-offs for different customer segments.
  - Estimates of cost and complexity for protocol migration vs. infra optimization.
- **9.2 Incremental adjustment approach**
  - Roll out optimizations gradually by region and customer tier; monitor metrics before global rollout.
  - Keep the option to roll back to the previous protocol / routing strategy.
- **9.3 "Better, not perfect" criteria**
  - p99 latency ≤2s for main signing flows and clear UX explaining rare slower cases.
  - No new critical security findings in post-change audits.

### 10. Summary & Action Recommendations (Aspect 10)

- **10.1 Core insights**
  - The latency issue is largely a composition of protocol design, topology, and operational choices, not an immutable property of MPC.
  - Tail latency drives user perception and must be explicitly budgeted and monitored.
  - Meaningful gains are likely achievable without weakening security, but require cross-functional work.
- **10.2 Near-term action list (0–3 months)**
  - 【P0】Define and publish internal latency SLOs (p50/p95/p99) for all MPC signing flows; instrument detailed tracing to support them.
  - 【P0】Implement or expand presigning infrastructure and measure its impact on online latency under load.
  - 【P1】Prototype and benchmark one modern low-round threshold protocol in a sandbox environment.
  - 【P1】Deploy multi-region routing and quorum selection logic to avoid slow regions on the critical path.
  - 【P2】Update UX to show progress and set expectations for exceptional slow cases, reducing perceived uncertainty.
- **10.3 Key risks and responses**
  - Risk (High): New protocol or infra bugs introduce security vulnerabilities.
    - Response: third-party audits, formal verification where possible, phased rollout.
  - Risk (Medium): Complexity of presigning and routing creates operational failures.
    - Response: simplify designs; add runbooks, alerts, and chaos testing.

  - Compliance regimes: internal security review cycles, external audits.
- **3.3 Responsibility and maneuver room**
  - Vendor controls API design, tooling, and reference architectures.
  - Clients control their internal process and priorities but are constrained by risk committees and regulators.

### 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

- **4.1 Key historical nodes**
  - First MPC products exposed low-level cryptographic operations directly.
  - Documentation-first attempts showed limits: knowledge gaps persisted, and each client repeated similar discovery work.
- **4.2 Deep vs. direct causes**

  - Options: high-level managed offering, opinionated workflows, better tooling.
  - Risks: over-abstracting away security; one-size-fits-all APIs.
- **7.2 Key judgments**
  - Most integration delay is not in pure coding time but in **conceptual alignment and security review**.
  - Opinionated templates can shorten reviews without materially reducing flexibility.
- **7.3 Alternative paths**
  - Path A: Low-level "Lego" MPC API plus extensive docs (status quo with improvements).
  - Path B: High-level, vertical-specific "wallet-as-a-service" interfaces with strong defaults.

## Problem 3 – Regulatory Compliance and Auditability of MPC Wallets

### 1. Problem Definition (Aspect 1)

- **1.1 Problem and contradictions**
  - MPC improves privacy and removes single-key control, yet regulators expect clear lines of control, ownership, and audit trails.
  - Contradiction: "no single party can sign alone" vs. regulatory needs for a responsible entity and provable controls.
- **1.2 Goals and conditions**
  - Goal: design MPC-based custody that passes audits (e.g., NYDFS, MiCA, Travel Rule regimes) without reconstructing keys.
  - Conditions: preserve MPC security guarantees; operate across multiple jurisdictions with evolving rules.
- **1.3 Extensibility and reframing**
  - Reframe from "MPC hides who signed" to "MPC provides **stronger, provable control policies**" via logs and cryptographic attestations.
  - View the problem as designing a **compliance evidence layer** on top of MPC.

### 2. Internal Logical Relations (Aspect 2)

- **2.1 Key elements**
  - Signing policies: thresholds, role-based approvals, risk-based flows.

  - Governance processes: key-share lifecycle management, incident response, change control.
- **2.2 Balance and "degree"**
  - Privacy vs. transparency: how much detail to expose to regulators, auditors, and counterparties.
  - On-chain vs. off-chain evidence: verifiable on-chain traces vs. private logs subject to SOC controls.
- **2.3 Key internal causal chains**
  - Poor logging and unclear policies → regulators perceive "black-box magic" → delayed or denied licenses.
  - Strong governance and clear evidence artifacts → smoother regulatory approvals → higher institutional adoption.

### 3. External Connections (Aspect 3)

- **3.1 Stakeholders**
  - Regulators, law enforcement: require provable control, AML/CTF compliance, and audit trails.
  - Institutional clients: want regulatory clarity and assurance that MPC does not increase compliance risk.

- **3.2 Environment and institutions**
  - Rapidly evolving crypto regulations; different jurisdictions interpret MPC differently.
  - Standards bodies and industry groups defining best practices (e.g., for Travel Rule data handling).
- **3.3 Responsibility and maneuver room**
  - MPC provider must proactively help shape regulatory understanding and best practices.
  - Clients can adapt policies, but base capability to produce appropriate evidence must come from the product.

### 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

- **4.1 Key historical nodes**
  - Traditional HSM-based custody maps cleanly to existing regulatory expectations.
  - MPC introduced "keyless" control semantics that many regulators initially did not understand.
- **4.2 Background vs. direct causes**
  - Background: misalignment between fast innovation in cryptography and slower-moving legal frameworks.
  - Direct causes: early MPC products focused on security features without compliance artifacts or regulatory engagement.
- **4.3 Deep structural issues**

  - Well-designed evidence artifacts can make MPC **more** compliant than traditional models.
- **7.3 Alternative paths**
  - Path A: minimal change; rely on generic SOC reports and internal logs.
  - Path B: build a compliance-focused auditability layer with standard reports and proofs.
  - Path C: collaborate with regulators and peers to define reference standards and certification programs.

### 8. Validating the Answer (Aspect 8)

- **8.1 Biases**

  - MPC can be framed as an **enhancement** to control and governance if evidence is designed well.
- **10.2 Near-term actions (0–3 months)**
  - 【P0】Map technical events and policies to specific regulatory requirements for 1–2 priority jurisdictions.
  - 【P0】Design an internal audit log schema that captures all required evidence in a regulator-friendly way.
  - 【P1】Engage external counsel to draft baseline legal opinions and recommended control sets.
  - 【P1】Prototype exporter tools that transform logs into human-readable compliance reports.
- **10.3 Risks and responses**
  - Risk (High): Misinterpretation of MPC by regulators slows or blocks approvals.

## Problem 4 – Operational Risk of Participant Failure in MPC Wallets

### 1. Problem Definition (Aspect 1)

- **1.1 Problem and contradictions**
  - MPC is designed to avoid single-key failure, yet unavailability of participants can effectively recreate a new form of lockout.
  - Contradiction: high security via threshold schemes vs. practical need for near-constant availability.
- **1.2 Goals and conditions**
  - Goal: achieve ≥99.99% availability of signing operations while preserving strong security.
  - Condition: backup/recovery mechanisms must not reintroduce single points of failure or trivialize the threat model.
- **1.3 Extensibility and reframing**
  - Reframe from "avoid any lockout" to "design **graceful degradation and recoverable lockouts**".
  - Consider multiple failure modes: device loss, network partitions, cloud outages, human unavailability.

### 2. Internal Logical Relations (Aspect 2)

- **2.1 Key elements**
  - Threshold parameters (t-of-n), device roles (user, co-signer, backup), quorum selection strategies.
  - Backup and recovery workflows: how new shares are generated, who approves, what delays are imposed.
- **2.2 Balance and "degree"**
  - Redundancy vs. complexity: more parties and backups reduce risk of lockout but increase operational complexity.
  - Recovery speed vs. security: faster recovery may mean weaker checks and higher social-engineering risk.
- **2.3 Key causal chains**
  - Too few redundancies → normal churn (device loss, staff changes) → threshold not reachable → funds effectively frozen.
  - Overly complex recovery → users/operators avoid testing it → when needed, it fails or takes too long.

### 3. External Connections (Aspect 3)

- **3.1 Stakeholders**
  - End-users: fear irreversible lockouts more than moderate latency.
  - Operations / SRE: responsible for uptime and incident response.
  - Risk management and insurers: assess residual lockout risk and potential losses.
- **3.2 Environment and institutions**
  - Reliance on cloud providers, data centers, and communication infrastructure.
  - Legal/institutional constraints on where shares can be stored (jurisdictions, data residency).
- **3.3 Responsibility and maneuver room**
  - MPC provider can shape default t-of-n patterns, recovery policies, and infrastructure redundancy.
  - Clients control staffing models, device hygiene, and physical security.

### 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

- **4.1 Historical nodes**
  - Early MPC deployments reused HSM-style thinking with minimal consideration of human/device churn.
  - Real-world use exposed high rates of device loss, SIM changes, and personnel turnover.
- **4.2 Background vs. direct causes**
  - Background: security culture that overemphasizes secrecy and underestimates operational fragility.
  - Direct: insufficient redundancy, lack of tested disaster-recovery runbooks.
- **4.3 Deep structural issues**
  - Misalignment between security and reliability metrics; no unified risk framework comparing "funds stolen" vs. "funds frozen".

### 5. Problem Trends (Aspect 5)

- **5.1 Trend judgment**
  - As user counts grow, even low per-user failure probability produces a large absolute number of lockouts if not addressed.
- **5.2 Early signals**
  - Support tickets about lost devices, unreachable co-signers, and frozen wallets.
  - Ad-hoc workarounds and manual interventions by support teams.
- **5.3 Scenarios**
  - Optimistic: mature recovery patterns (e.g., social recovery, institutional guardians, distributed backups) make lockouts rare and recoverable.
  - Baseline: occasional high-impact lockouts harm reputation but are handled case by case.
  - Pessimistic: several widely publicized lockout incidents significantly damage trust in MPC wallets.

### 6. Capability Reserves (Aspect 6)

- **6.1 Existing capabilities**
  - Technical ability to configure t-of-n schemes and multi-region deployments.
- **6.2 Capability gaps**
  - Human-centered design of recovery flows; risk modeling; structured chaos and DR testing.
- **6.3 Capabilities to build**

### 7. Analysis Outline (Aspect 7)

- **7.1 Outline**
  - Background: thresholds, human/device churn.
  - Problem: effective lockouts from participant failure.
  - Analysis: categorize failure modes; quantify probabilities and impacts.
  - Options: more redundancy, dynamic quorum selection, robust recovery flows.
  - Risks: increased attack surface, social-engineering possibilities.
- **7.2 Key judgments**
  - Most user anxiety centers on irrecoverable loss; well-designed recovery is a key adoption driver.
  - Safe recovery is possible without reintroducing classic single-key risk if carefully constrained.
- **7.3 Alternative paths**
  - Path A: pure cryptographic redundancy (higher n, distributed nodes).
  - Path B: hybrid cryptographic + social / institutional recovery.
  - Path C: tiered products (vault vs. daily wallet) with different recovery guarantees.

### 8. Validating the Answer (Aspect 8)

- **8.1 Biases**
  - Security teams may over-index on preventing theft vs. preventing permanent loss.
- **8.2 Required intelligence**
  - Empirical data on device loss, staff turnover, and network downtime.
  - User research on perceived vs. actual lockout risk.
- **8.3 Validation plan**
  - Simulate lockout scenarios under different t-of-n and recovery policies; measure MTTR.
  - Run usability tests on recovery flows.

### 9. Revising the Answer (Aspect 9)

- **9.1 Likely-to-change parts**
  - Optimal t-of-n and recovery delay parameters as more data arrives.
- **9.2 Incremental adjustment**
  - Start with conservative thresholds and slow recovery; gradually relax as confidence in controls grows.
- **9.3 "Good enough" criteria**
  - Lockout probability and MTTR both within acceptable risk budgets; recovery flows demonstrably usable.

### 10. Summary & Action Recommendations (Aspect 10)

- **10.1 Core insights**
  - Participant failure can quietly reintroduce catastrophic risk if not counterbalanced by redundancy and recovery.
  - Addressing lockout risk is as important as addressing theft risk for user trust.
- **10.2 Near-term actions (0–3 months)**
  - 【P0】Quantify current lockout incidents and establish target metrics (e.g., maximum tolerable lockout rate and MTTR).
  - 【P0】Define reference t-of-n patterns and infra redundancy standards per product tier.
  - 【P1】Design and test at least one end-to-end recovery flow for both retail and institutional users.
  - 【P1】Plan regular DR drills and chaos tests that include participant unavailability scenarios.
- **10.3 Risks and responses**
  - Risk (High): Recovery flows become an attack vector for social engineering.
    - Response: multi-channel verification, delays, multi-party approvals, clear audit trails.
  - Risk (Medium): Overly complex recovery procedures cause operational errors.
    - Response: simplify workflows; provide guided UIs and training.

### 2. Internal Logical Relations (Aspect 2)

- **2.1 Key elements**
  - Cryptographic primitives and protocol design (curve choice, zero-knowledge components, etc.).
  - Client-side implementation: language, libraries, use of hardware acceleration.
  - Session management: reuse of precomputed material, connection reuse, batching.
- **2.2 Balance and "degree"**
  - Local compute vs. network dependency: moving work off-device saves battery but increases latency and centralization risk.
  - Security vs. UX: more checks and stronger primitives vs. responsiveness and thermal behavior.
- **2.3 Key causal chains**
  - Inefficient implementation → high CPU usage → battery drain and device heating → uninstalls and bad reviews.
  - Lack of precomputation → heavy burst of work at signing time → poor perceived performance.

### 3. External Connections (Aspect 3)

- **3.1 Stakeholders**
  - Mobile users: prioritize battery life, responsiveness, and device temperature.
  - Mobile developers: need maintainable code and cross-platform consistency.
  - Protocol designers: must balance security with deployability on consumer hardware.
- **3.2 Environment and institutions**
  - Mobile OS platform constraints (background execution limits, battery optimization policies).
  - App-store review guidelines that may penalize resource-hungry apps.
- **3.3 Responsibility and maneuver room**
  - Wallet provider controls protocol choice and client implementation quality.
  - Users can adjust settings (e.g., using Wi-Fi only, performance vs. security modes) but should not be required to manage complexity.

### 4. Origins of the Problem (Aspect 4)

- **4.1 Historical nodes**
  - MPC protocols were initially designed with server-class hardware in mind.
  - Early mobile MPC implementations often used generic big-integer libraries and unoptimized network stacks.
- **4.2 Background vs. direct causes**
  - Background: rapid evolution of mobile hardware; lag in cryptographic library optimization for mobile.
  - Direct: suboptimal code paths, lack of hardware acceleration, no presigning.
- **4.3 Deep structural issues**
  - Disconnect between protocol research and real-world mobile performance engineering.

### 5. Problem Trends (Aspect 5)

- **5.1 Trend judgment**
  - As more wallet activity shifts to mobile, resource inefficiency becomes a central adoption barrier.
- **5.2 Early signals**
  - User complaints about battery consumption and overheating during signing.
  - App-store ratings referencing performance issues.
- **5.3 Scenarios**
  - Optimistic: protocol selection and client optimization make MPC signing barely noticeable in day-to-day use.
  - Baseline: MPC wallets work well only on high-end devices; mid-range users suffer.
  - Pessimistic: resource pain leads to abandonment; MPC remains niche on mobile.

### 6. Capability Reserves (Aspect 6)

- **6.1 Existing capabilities**
  - Knowledge of more efficient curves and protocols (e.g., Ed25519-based schemes).
- **6.2 Capability gaps**
  - Deep mobile performance profiling; exploitation of platform-specific crypto acceleration (e.g., ARM NEON, Secure Enclave, TEE APIs).
- **6.3 Capabilities to build**
  - Mobile performance engineering and benchmarking infrastructure; collaboration with library authors.

### 7. Analysis Outline (Aspect 7)

- **7.1 Outline**
  - Background: mobile hardware constraints vs. MPC demands.
  - Problem: high battery / CPU usage and perceived slowness.
  - Analysis: decompose costs into cryptographic operations, network, and app overhead.
  - Options: protocol-level optimization, client implementation optimization, division of labor with servers.
  - Risks: centralization, security regression, platform fragmentation.
- **7.2 Key judgments**
  - Protocol-level efficiencies usually dominate micro-optimizations.
  - Many users will accept slightly higher latency if battery impact is very low.
- **7.3 Alternative paths**
  - Path A: choose a mobile-friendly protocol and optimize libraries.
  - Path B: offload more computation to server-side participants.
  - Path C: offer modes ("eco" vs. "performance" vs. "max security") with clear trade-offs.

### 8. Validating the Answer (Aspect 8)

- **8.1 Biases**
  - Engineering bias to chase micro-benchmarks rather than holistic UX metrics.
- **8.2 Required intelligence**
  - Real-world battery and CPU profiles across device tiers and OS versions.
  - User research on tolerance for latency vs. battery consumption.
- **8.3 Validation plan**
  - A/B test optimized clients vs. baseline on a sample of users; monitor battery impact, performance, and uninstall rates.

### 9. Revising the Answer (Aspect 9)

- **9.1 Likely-to-change parts**
  - Optimal balance between local compute and server delegation as device capabilities evolve.
- **9.2 Incremental adjustment**
  - Start with conservative optimizations; roll out more aggressive changes behind feature flags.
- **9.3 "Good enough" criteria**
  - Signing perceived as "instant enough" and not mentioned as a top-3 complaint; resource usage within targets on mid-range devices.

### 10. Summary & Action Recommendations (Aspect 10)

- **10.1 Core insights**
  - Mobile resource consumption is a decisive factor for MPC wallet adoption at scale.
  - The bulk of improvement likely comes from protocol selection and intelligent division of labor, not just micro-optimizations.
- **10.2 Near-term actions (0–3 months)**
  - 【P0】Benchmark current mobile clients on representative devices; establish baseline metrics for CPU, battery, and latency.
  - 【P0】Evaluate and, if beneficial, adopt more efficient cryptographic schemes and libraries optimized for mobile.
  - 【P1】Implement presigning and caching strategies to shift work off of interactive signing paths.
  - 【P1】Design and test multiple operating modes (e.g., eco vs. max-security) with clear user education.
- **10.3 Risks and responses**
  - Risk (Medium): Over-optimizing for mobile leads to more reliance on centralized infrastructure.
    - Response: document centralization trade-offs; diversify server locations; keep multi-party assumptions intact.
  - Risk (Low–Medium): Platform changes (OS updates) invalidate some optimizations.
    - Response: continuous performance regression testing across OS and device updates.
