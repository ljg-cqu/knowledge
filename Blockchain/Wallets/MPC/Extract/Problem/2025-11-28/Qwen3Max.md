1. Q: For an institutional crypto custodian planning to deploy modern MPC wallets (threshold ECDSA/EdDSA) to secure large balances (hundreds of millions to billions of dollars), formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The custodian faces persistent, hard‑to‑quantify risk that subtle cryptographic and implementation flaws in complex MPC protocols (e.g., BitForge‑class key‑extraction attacks, TSSHOCK issues, side channels, weak randomness) could allow attackers to reconstruct private keys with relatively few signing interactions, even when using audited, industry‑standard libraries.
   - **Background and current situation**: The custody stack relies on state‑of‑the‑art threshold ECDSA/EdDSA schemes such as GG‑18/GG‑20/Lindell17, tss‑lib variants, and general MPC frameworks, which have already seen multiple critical 0‑day disclosures affecting 15+ providers and forcing emergency patches. Security reviews typically combine academic proofs, vendor whitepapers, and periodic third‑party audits, yet new attack classes (e.g., improper failure handling, hash‑collision encodings, MAC‑key leakage under concurrency, non‑constant‑time arithmetic, low‑entropy PRNGs) continue to surface after systems are in production. As assets and transaction volumes grow, leadership must decide how much to trust these protocols versus simpler alternatives while still meeting performance and feature requirements.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The organization wants to reduce the probability of catastrophic key‑extraction events (loss or full compromise of one or more custody wallets) to well below regulatory and internal risk thresholds (for example, <10⁻⁶ per signer‑year for any single key and <10⁻⁷ per year for platform‑wide correlated failure), while sustaining required throughput and latency commitments. Success means being able to justify, to boards and regulators, that protocol and implementation risks have been systematically identified, monitored, and reduced to an acceptably low residual level, with clear evidence that new 0‑days are unlikely to lead to undetected, large‑scale asset loss.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Cryptography and formal‑methods experts are scarce and expensive, and the team must largely rely on a small number of open‑source libraries, commercial MPC vendors, and external auditors with limited bandwidth. The custody platform is already in production, so disruptive protocol migrations or long signing outages are politically and operationally difficult, and performance requirements (e.g., keeping most signatures within 2–5 seconds and not degrading overall TPS by more than 15–20%) constrain the choice of more conservative countermeasures. Budget is significant but not unlimited, and must cover compliance, infrastructure, and product development in addition to advanced security work.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Key stakeholders include security and cryptography teams (responsible for protocol selection, audits, and incident response), wallet and backend engineers (who integrate MPC libraries and manage signing infrastructure), product and business owners (who depend on reliable custody for new services and revenue), institutional clients and retail users (whose assets are at risk), and regulators or auditors (who evaluate whether the custody setup meets prudential and fiduciary standards). Each group has different risk tolerances and incentives: engineers and security teams may advocate for conservative designs, while business stakeholders push for new features and faster time‑to‑market.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The relevant horizon spans roughly 1–3 years, covering current deployments and near‑term protocol upgrades across all supported assets and chains. A single successful key‑extraction exploit could cause direct losses from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, cascading reputational damage, possible license revocation in key jurisdictions, and multi‑year legal or regulatory exposure; conversely, overly cautious designs that block features or add heavy latency might materially limit business growth.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The organization and the broader industry have already adopted several mitigations, including migrating to newer protocol versions after past disclosures, commissioning one‑off third‑party audits, adding internal unit/integration tests, and participating in coordinated disclosure programs. However, these efforts have been reactive and episodic; major vulnerabilities (e.g., BitForge, TSSHOCK, SPDZ MAC leakage, timing side channels) still reached production in multiple providers despite prior reviews, and there is no unified, continuously updated risk model that covers library choices, implementation invariants, and operational usage patterns.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Multiple severe key‑extraction vulnerabilities in modern MPC protocols and libraries have been discovered and, in some cases, exploited; some required as few as 1–256 signatures or even a single protocol run to recover keys. Facts: These issues affected many well‑resourced providers that had undergone reputable audits. Assumptions: Future protocol and implementation bugs of similar severity are likely to appear over the next 1–3 years as usage scales and more researchers scrutinize MPC code. Assumptions: With sufficient investment, layered mitigations (e.g., hardened implementations, invariant checks, defense‑in‑depth signing workflows) can drive effective risk down to an acceptable level without fully abandoning MPC. Uncertainties: The true residual risk of unknown implementation flaws, the completeness and quality of available audits, the comparative long‑term safety of MPC versus alternatives (e.g., multisig or smart‑contract wallets), and how regulators will interpret "reasonable" controls in the event of future MPC‑related losses.

1. Q: For a digital‑asset platform that already uses MPC or multi‑sig wallets together with hardware devices, but has suffered or fears Bybit‑style UI and dApp‑driven attacks, formulate a structured problem statement about transaction intent verification and blind signing using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The platform’s current signing flows validate cryptographic correctness (signatures, key control) but provide weak or no guarantees that what human approvers see on screen matches the actual on‑chain transaction semantics, leaving the organization exposed to blind‑signing attacks via compromised UIs, malicious smart contract upgrades, and deceptive dApps.
   - **Background and current situation**: Operational staff and high‑privilege signers routinely approve transactions using interfaces that show only partial or potentially manipulated information (e.g., destination addresses, token symbols, or innocuous text). Past incidents in the wider ecosystem, including billion‑dollar‑scale hacks where frontends were tampered with or EIP‑712 messages were injected with hidden fields, demonstrate that signers can be tricked into authorizing `delegatecall`s, unlimited approvals, or administrative changes they did not intend. Many MPC and hardware wallets operate on opaque transaction bytes, lack deep smart‑contract parsing, and rely on external UIs or dApps to convey meaning, creating a gap between signature validity and business intent.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The organization wants to ensure that every transaction requiring human or policy approval is checked against its true on‑chain effect so that the chance of approving a materially unintended or malicious transaction falls below a stringent threshold (for example, less than one catastrophic intent failure in 10⁵–10⁶ high‑value operations). Success would mean that even if frontends or dApps are compromised, signers and automated policies reliably block unsafe actions, and regulators or clients can see evidence that pre‑execution simulation and intent verification are consistently enforced.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Many existing wallets, MPC engines, and hardware devices cannot easily introspect arbitrary contract calls or cross‑chain payloads, and retrofitting deep simulation may introduce latency (seconds per transaction), complexity, and new failure modes. The platform must continue supporting a diverse ecosystem of dApps, bridges, and protocols, some of which have opaque or rapidly changing ABIs, and any stricter intent checks must not degrade legitimate user experience to the point of driving users away. Engineering and security teams are already stretched maintaining core custody, monitoring, and compliance tooling, and there may be limited appetite from product owners to add friction to high‑volume workflows.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include operations staff and signers (who need to understand what they are approving), security and risk teams (charged with preventing fraud and large‑scale loss), wallet/backend engineers (who build or integrate simulation and policy engines), product managers and UX designers (who balance safety with usability), institutional clients (who demand strong assurances around admin actions and withdrawals), and regulators or auditors (who evaluate whether transaction‑approval processes meet fiduciary and consumer‑protection expectations).
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The relevant horizon is on the order of 6–24 months, covering the rollout of intent‑aware signing for all high‑risk flows (admin actions, large withdrawals, contract upgrades, bridge interactions) across the platform’s supported chains and products. A single failure of intent verification in one high‑privilege wallet could cause direct losses in the tens or hundreds of millions, severe reputational damage, and lasting distrust from institutional clients and regulators; repeated smaller incidents could erode confidence and lead to stricter external oversight.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The platform, or its vendors, may already use ad‑hoc mitigations such as basic transaction previews, optional simulation endpoints, or rule engines that check simple fields (e.g., known destination lists, amount thresholds). However, these controls are often inconsistently enforced, not cryptographically bound to what is actually signed, and do not fully cover complex smart‑contract behaviors, bridge interactions, or oracle‑dependent effects. Industry‑wide, some providers have begun integrating systematic pre‑signature simulation and policy enforcement, but coverage and robustness vary widely, and major losses from blind signing and malicious dApps continue to occur.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Several of the largest recent crypto losses were caused by UI manipulation, misleading transaction previews, or malicious contract logic rather than direct key theft; many hardware and MPC wallets still sign opaque payloads. Facts: At least dozens of popular wallets have been shown to mishandle or mis‑display structured signing data (e.g., EIP‑712) in ways that attackers can exploit. Assumptions: Attackers will continue to target UIs, dApps, and transaction‑construction layers because these vectors bypass key‑management defenses, and the economic incentive to find new blind‑signing tricks will grow with TVL. Uncertainties: The practical limits of scalable, low‑latency transaction simulation across heterogeneous chains, how often simulations or intent checks may themselves fail or be bypassed, and how regulators will judge “reasonable” safeguards when evaluating future blind‑signing incidents.

1. Q: For a wallet provider or exchange evaluating whether its MPC‑based custody architecture is operationally and economically viable at scale, formulate a structured problem statement about performance, centralization, usability, and expertise trade‑offs using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The provider must decide how to balance MPC’s security benefits against concrete drawbacks such as added signing latency, reduced throughput, reintroduced centralization in provider‑orchestrated models, complex recovery flows, and the need for scarce cryptography and distributed‑systems expertise, all of which can limit adoption and profitability.
   - **Background and current situation**: Current MPC deployments introduce multi‑round signing ceremonies that slow transactions from near‑instantaneous single‑key signatures to typical ranges of 2–5 seconds, and sometimes 10–30 seconds under poor network conditions or global coordination. Simulations of high‑volume systems, such as CBDCs using advanced threshold schemes, show throughput drops from roughly 190 TPS to around 10 TPS when every transaction uses MPC, while consumer wallets often centralize one key share and orchestration in a single provider, shifting the single point of failure from a seed phrase to the operator’s infrastructure and business continuity. Recovery and onboarding flows may require biometrics, email, and cloud backups, leading to higher drop‑off rates and new failure modes, and only a minority of engineering teams have the deep expertise needed to implement and maintain MPC correctly.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The organization wants a custody model that materially improves resilience against key theft and operational mistakes without degrading user experience beyond acceptable thresholds (for example, keeping 95% of user‑visible transactions under 5 seconds and supporting target TPS for institutional flows) or reintroducing unacceptably large centralization or vendor lock‑in risks. Success would include quantifiable improvements in security metrics (e.g., fewer key‑management incidents, stronger disaster‑recovery guarantees) while maintaining or improving key business metrics such as onboarding completion rates, transaction success rates, and unit economics for custody and transaction processing.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: Network conditions between MPC parties (including mobile or geographically distributed participants) are only partially controllable, and strict latency requirements from trading or real‑time applications may constrain protocol and deployment choices. The provider may be contractually or regulatorily bound to specific hosting regions, recovery models, or third‑party escrow arrangements, limiting architectural flexibility. Engineering headcount with relevant expertise is limited, integration budgets for protocol upgrades or architecture changes are capped, and any major change that risks downtime or degraded UX may face internal resistance from product and commercial teams.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include end users (retail and institutional) who care about speed, reliability, and recoverability; product and growth teams (who are measured on adoption, retention, and revenue); platform and wallet engineers (who must build and operate the MPC and recovery infrastructure); security and SRE teams (who focus on resilience, incident response, and SLAs); and regulators or compliance officers (who may mandate specific custody or cold‑storage practices, and who evaluate operational risk). Their priorities often conflict—for example, security advocates for more checks and redundancy while product pushes for fewer steps and smoother flows.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The planning horizon spans roughly 1–3 years, covering anticipated user and volume growth, expansion into new markets, and potential migrations between custody architectures (e.g., from pure MPC to hybrid models). Poorly chosen trade‑offs could result in chronic user‑experience issues, abandonment of MPC‑based products, elevated operational costs, or catastrophic outages in high‑volume environments, while over‑indexing on simplicity might leave the platform exposed to key‑theft risks that MPC would have mitigated.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The provider and peers have experimented with different custody patterns, such as shifting between multisig and MPC, adding centralized recovery escrows, or introducing partial MPC only for large transactions. Some have bolted on additional layers like cold‑storage procedures or fallback keys to address recovery concerns, and have tuned protocols or infrastructure to improve latency. However, many of these adjustments have been incremental, reactive responses to pain points (e.g., user complaints, outages, new markets) rather than the result of a holistic, quantitative analysis of end‑to‑end trade‑offs.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: MPC signing introduces measurable latency and overhead versus single‑key signatures, and in some settings has reduced throughput by an order of magnitude; consumer‑oriented MPC wallets commonly centralize one key share with a provider and rely on complex recovery schemes; onboarding and recovery flows for MPC wallets show higher friction and dropout than simple seed‑phrase models. Assumptions: Demand for secure, regulated digital‑asset custody will continue to grow, and users will tolerate some additional friction in exchange for better safety if it is clearly communicated and well designed. Uncertainties: The true long‑term user tolerance for MPC‑related delays and complexity, the comparative business impact of different custody architectures (pure MPC, multisig, smart‑contract wallets, or hybrids), and how quickly protocol or implementation advances might alleviate current performance and usability costs.

1. Q: For an exchange, custodian, or DeFi protocol operator that has invested heavily in MPC‑secured keys but observed that most major recent losses stem from infrastructure, supply‑chain, or cross‑chain bridge compromises, formulate a structured problem statement about systemic threats beyond key management using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The organization must confront the reality that, even with strong MPC or multisig key management, it remains highly exposed to systemic risks in backend infrastructure, internal controls, and cross‑chain interoperability layers, where attackers can bypass or render irrelevant the protections offered by MPC.
   - **Background and current situation**: Recent high‑profile incidents show that major losses often arise from compromised backend services, supply‑chain attacks on server logic, internal mismanagement and commingling of assets, and vulnerabilities in cross‑chain bridges and validator sets, not from direct key theft. Studies and post‑mortems indicate that a large share of aggregate crypto losses in some periods (e.g., >60% in one quarter) were linked to centralized infrastructure failures and bridge exploits, including validator compromises, forged messages, oracle manipulation, and missing or unavailable key‑holders. The organization operates in this environment while marketing MPC as a core differentiator, creating a potential mismatch between perceived and actual risk coverage.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal is to reduce the share of risk that comes from non‑key‑management failures—such as backend compromise, bridge exploits, or governance breakdowns—to a level comparable with or lower than the residual risk from key theft, while preserving the operational flexibility needed to support cross‑chain and multi‑product strategies. Success would be evidenced by a robust defense‑in‑depth posture where no single infrastructure or interoperability weakness can easily lead to large, undetected asset outflows, and where auditors and regulators can verify strong segregation of duties, asset segregation, and resilient operational processes.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: The platform depends on complex legacy infrastructure, third‑party service providers, and external bridges or interoperability protocols that it does not fully control, and re‑architecting or replacing these components would be expensive and slow. Regulatory requirements, business partnerships, and market expectations constrain the ability to abandon certain ecosystems or intermediaries, while security and engineering teams already manage a large backlog of maintenance and feature demands. Monitoring, logging, and incident‑response capabilities may be uneven across systems, and budget for large‑scale refactoring or provider changes competes with growth initiatives.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include infrastructure and DevOps teams (who build and operate backend systems), security and governance teams (who design policies, audits, and segregation of duties), bridge and protocol integrators (who select and maintain interoperability components), business and product leadership (who decide which chains, bridges, and partners to support), institutional and retail customers (whose assets traverse these systems), and regulators or standard‑setting bodies (who care about systemic stability, consumer protection, and prudent custody practices).
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The relevant time frame is multi‑year (roughly 1–5 years), reflecting the effort required to redesign or migrate critical infrastructure and bridge dependencies while continuing operations. A single systemic failure in backend systems or a critical bridge could cause losses in the tens or hundreds of millions, trigger regulatory sanctions or license loss, damage trust in the broader ecosystem, and require months or years of remediation and legal work.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The organization may already enforce basic controls such as access management, code reviews, vendor security questionnaires, and some degree of redundancy in critical systems, and may have diversified across several bridge providers. Industry‑wide, regulators and banking bodies have published guidance on custody best practices, and some actors have strengthened internal governance following collapses and hacks. Nonetheless, repeated incidents show persistent weaknesses: inadequate segregation between custody and trading functions, fragile operational processes, and bridge architectures where the compromise of a few validators or oracle feeds can drain large treasuries despite MPC‑secured keys.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Multiple large losses at exchanges and bridge protocols occurred without attackers breaking MPC or multisig key schemes, instead exploiting backend logic, governance failures, or validator/oracle weaknesses; cross‑chain bridges have accounted for billions in cumulative losses. Facts: Traditional banking principles like asset segregation and prudential oversight are still unevenly applied in many crypto‑native custodians. Assumptions: Attackers will continue to focus on the weakest links in complex ecosystems, which are often off‑chain infrastructure or cross‑chain logic rather than raw key storage. Uncertainties: The effectiveness and maturity of emerging standards for secure bridge design, the practical cost and timeline of hardening or replacing fragile infrastructure components, and how regulators will allocate responsibility across custodians, infrastructure providers, and protocol teams after future systemic incidents.

1. Q: For an MPC wallet provider aiming to operate in multiple major jurisdictions (e.g., EU, USA, Singapore) while serving institutional clients, formulate a structured problem statement about regulatory scrutiny, compliance burdens, and fragmented global rules using the following [Input] fields.
   A:
   - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The provider must determine how to design and operate its MPC‑based custody and transaction‑processing services so they remain compliant with a rapidly evolving, fragmented set of global regulations (MiCA, SEC custody rules, FinCEN and FATF Travel Rule guidance, MAS requirements, and others) without incurring unsustainable operational and financial costs or undermining product viability.
   - **Background and current situation**: Regulators in the EU, USA, Singapore, and other regions are imposing bank‑like custody standards on digital‑asset service providers, including passportable licensing, stringent AML/CFT controls, real‑time or near‑real‑time transaction monitoring, strict travel‑rule data exchange, asset segregation, cold‑storage mandates, and comprehensive internal controls. Implementing MPC itself can require initial investments on the order of tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and layering on the needed compliance infrastructure (KYC/AML flows, monitoring, audits, reporting, geographically partitioned infrastructure, and data‑residency controls) further increases costs and complexity. Fragmented rules force providers to operate different configurations per region, and some banking regimes still explicitly favor or mandate particular custody models (e.g., cold multisig) that do not map cleanly onto MPC designs.
   - **Goals and success criteria**: The provider wants to achieve and maintain full compliance in its target jurisdictions—securing and keeping the necessary licenses, passing audits, and avoiding enforcement actions—while keeping per‑customer and per‑transaction compliance costs within acceptable bounds so the business can scale profitably. Success would mean being able to demonstrate to regulators and institutional clients that its custody model satisfies requirements around asset segregation, transparency, and risk management, while still delivering competitive UX and feature sets and supporting cross‑border operations where legally permitted.
   - **Key constraints and resources**: The regulatory landscape evolves faster than typical product roadmaps, and interpretations of existing rules can change with new guidance or high‑profile incidents. The provider has finite legal, compliance, and engineering capacity to track rule changes, implement new controls, and adjust infrastructure (e.g., standing up region‑specific deployments for data residency or travel‑rule partner integrations). Many banking partners and legacy systems have limited support for blockchain operations, requiring custom integrations or workarounds, and aggressive compliance postures from banks can affect access to fiat rails and correspondent relationships.
   - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include compliance and legal teams (who interpret regulations, liaise with regulators, and design control frameworks), security and engineering teams (who must implement technical controls consistent with both MPC designs and regulatory expectations), product and commercial leaders (who define target markets and customer segments), institutional clients and their own compliance departments (who assess the provider’s suitability as a custodian), and regulators, supervisors, and auditors (who enforce rules and approve or deny licenses). Their priorities may conflict—for example, clients may push for global, seamless services while regulators demand strict regional segregation and data controls.
   - **Time scale and impact scope**: The time horizon is multi‑year (roughly 2–5 years), covering initial licensing, expansion into additional markets, and ongoing compliance monitoring and audits. Non‑compliance risks include significant fines, forced exits from key markets, loss of banking partners, and reputational damage, while over‑compliance or overly conservative designs could make the service too costly or slow to be competitive, especially for smaller institutions and cross‑border flows.
   - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The provider and its peers may already have implemented baseline KYC/AML processes, some travel‑rule integrations, periodic SOC 2 or ISO 27001 audits, and region‑specific infrastructure deployments. Industry groups, consultancies, and regulators have published guidance and best‑practice reports, and some providers have pursued bank‑like governance and capital structures. Nevertheless, many firms still struggle with reconciling MPC’s off‑chain signing and privacy properties with on‑chain transparency and detailed record‑keeping obligations, and compliance incidents or regulatory uncertainty continue to limit or delay product launches.
   - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Key frameworks such as MiCA, SEC custody rules, FinCEN and FATF guidance, and MAS regulations impose substantial, sometimes differing requirements on custody, monitoring, and reporting; initial MPC deployments are costly and ongoing compliance and audit programs add significant recurring expense. Facts: Regulators increasingly expect crypto custodians to meet standards similar to traditional bank custodians, including asset segregation and prudential oversight. Assumptions: Regulatory scrutiny on digital‑asset custody will intensify, not weaken, and institutions will favor providers that can convincingly demonstrate compliance and resilience. Uncertainties: The pace and direction of new or revised regulations, how specific regimes will treat MPC versus other custody models in practice, how much cost and architectural complexity regional fragmentation will ultimately impose, and whether smaller providers can sustain the necessary investment to remain compliant across multiple jurisdictions.
