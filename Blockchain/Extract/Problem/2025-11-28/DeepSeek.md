Based on the search results, I have analyzed the blockchain industry and identified several decision-critical problems. Here are the structured problem statements that capture key challenges affecting adoption, security, and sustainability.

1.  Q: Blockchain networks face a fundamental scalability bottleneck. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
    A:
    - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Major blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot process transactions at the scale required for global financial systems, creating a significant barrier to widespread adoption.
    - **Background and current situation**: Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin handle about 7 transactions per second (tps), and Ethereum around 30 tps. This is negligible compared to centralized systems like Visa, which processes over 24,000 tps. Despite solutions like Ethereum's upgrade and Layer-2 networks achieving 2,000-5,000 tps, this remains insufficient for global integration.
    - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal is to achieve transaction throughput that meets global demand. A target would be to reliably sustain tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining network decentralization and security.
    - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include the inherent trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization (the "blockchain trilemma"). Resources include Layer-1 protocol innovations and Layer-2 scaling solutions like state channels and rollups.
    - **Stakeholders and roles**: Key stakeholders are blockchain developers and foundations (driving core protocol upgrades), investors and users (experiencing high fees and slow transactions), and financial institutions (unable to adopt the technology at scale).
    - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is a long-term industry-wide challenge. The impact scope affects all potential users and use cases requiring high throughput, potentially numbering in the billions if blockchain is to become a foundational financial infrastructure.
    - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Historical solutions include the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (Eth2). Layer-2 solutions like rollups have also been deployed, but these have not yet closed the performance gap with traditional systems.
    - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Current public blockchain TPS is far below traditional financial systems. Assumptions: Scalability is a prerequisite for mass adoption. Uncertainties: Whether Layer-2 solutions alone can achieve the necessary scale or if more fundamental Layer-1 architectural changes are required.

2.  Q: The security focus is shifting from pure technical flaws to human and operational vulnerabilities. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
    A:
    - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Crypto asset security is increasingly compromised through non-technical vectors like social engineering, data breaches, and physical threats, making users and employees the primary attack target.
    - **Background and current situation**: In 2025, a significant portion of asset losses stems from social engineering, data leaks, and physical attacks such as armed robbery to obtain keys. Attackers are shifting focus from exploiting smart contract code to exploiting human weaknesses and operational processes.
    - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal is to reduce financial losses from non-technical attacks. A target could be to cut losses from social engineering and physical attacks by a specific percentage (e.g., 50%) within a year, moving the security benchmark beyond just code audits.
    - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include user privacy, the difficulty of enforcing security practices, and the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions. Resources include security awareness training, multi-signature wallets, time-lock mechanisms, and institutional security protocols.
    - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include individual users (targets of phishing and robbery), exchange and project employees (targets of sophisticated social engineering), and security teams (responsible for developing holistic security protocols).
    - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is an ongoing and evolving threat. The impact scope is global, affecting all asset holders. The financial impact in the first half of 2025 alone exceeded the total for all of 2024, reaching billions of dollars in losses.
    - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The industry has historically focused heavily on smart contract audits and technical security. Existing solutions are now expanding to include multi-sig, security training, and operational controls, but these are not yet universally adopted or fully effective against determined social engineering.
    - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Losses from these attack vectors have surpassed those from pure technical exploits in some periods. Assumptions: A holistic security approach is necessary. Uncertainties: The effectiveness of user education against increasingly sophisticated social engineering tactics.

3.  Q: Blockchain's inherent transparency conflicts with data privacy regulations. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
    A:
    - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: The radical transparency and immutability of most public blockchains make it technically impossible to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR's "right to be forgotten" or HIPAA's health data privacy requirements.
    - **Background and current situation**: Financial and health regulations require data privacy, selective disclosure, and deletion. However, data written to a public blockchain is permanently visible to all participants and cannot be altered or erased, creating a fundamental architectural mismatch.
    - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal is to enable blockchain applications to handle sensitive data in a regulatorily compliant manner. Success criteria would be the ability for enterprises in regulated industries to deploy blockchain solutions without violating GDPR, HIPAA, or other data governance laws.
    - **Key constraints and resources**: The primary constraint is the core design principle of immutable, transparent ledgers. Resources include emerging privacy-enhancing technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that allow for selective disclosure of information.
    - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders are enterprises and institutions in finance and healthcare (facing compliance risks), blockchain developers (needing to build compliant apps), and regulators (defining and enforcing compliance rules).
    - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is a medium to long-term problem that blocks institutional adoption. The impact scope is all enterprise-level applications of blockchain in regulated industries across major markets like the US and EU.
    - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Many early blockchains ignored this problem. Existing solutions now in development include ZKPs and novel tokenomics, but these are not yet standardized or widely integrated into mainstream enterprise systems.
    - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Regulations like GDPR and HIPAA exist and conflict with blockchain's default state. Assumptions: Institutional capital will not flow significantly until this conflict is resolved. Uncertainties: Which specific technological solution (e.g., ZKPs) will become the industry standard for compliance.

4.  Q: The energy consumption of Proof-of-Work blockchains poses environmental and sustainability challenges. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
    A:
    - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies consume vast amounts of electrical energy, leading to a large carbon footprint and attracting criticism from regulators and environmental advocates.
    - **Background and current situation**: The Bitcoin network's annual electricity consumption is estimated at 138 TWh, which is comparable to the energy usage of entire countries. This results in significant carbon emissions, estimated at 39.8 Mt of CO2 equivalent, though 52.4% of mining now uses sustainable energy sources.
    - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal is to transition the blockchain industry to a sustainable energy model. A target could be to increase the sustainable energy mix for PoW mining to over 80% or to achieve net-zero emissions for major networks within a defined timeframe.
    - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include the geographic distribution of miners and local access to cheap renewable energy. Resources include the economic incentive for miners to use the cheapest power (often renewables) and the development of carbon-neutral mining operations and offset projects.
    - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders include PoW miners (decision-makers on energy source), blockchain projects (facing reputational risk), investors (concerned with ESG criteria), and regulators (considering policies on energy use).
    - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is a long-term, global issue. The environmental impact extends beyond electricity to carbon emissions, water use, and electronic waste, affecting the public perception and regulatory treatment of the entire industry.
    - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: The main historical solution has been the transition of some chains like Ethereum to low-energy Proof-of-Stake. For Bitcoin, the solution has been a gradual shift towards renewable energy sources and the development of carbon-offset initiatives for mining operations.
    - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: Bitcoin's energy consumption is 138 TWh/year with 52.4% from sustainable sources. Assumptions: High energy consumption creates regulatory and reputational risks. Uncertainties: The pace at which the global energy grid will decarbonize to mitigate mining's impact.

5.  Q: Digital asset platforms face heightened compliance expectations amid new global enforcement actions. Formulate a structured problem statement using the following [Input] fields.
    A:
    - **Brief description of the problem to be analyzed**: Cryptocurrency exchanges and intermediaries must rapidly enhance their Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and sanctions compliance programs to meet heightened expectations from a new, coordinated global regulatory crackdown.
    - **Background and current situation**: The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a cross-agency "Scam Center Strike Force" targeting "pig-butchering" schemes, treating them as a national security issue. This signals a whole-of-government approach, with regulators expecting much more from platforms in monitoring, due diligence, and cooperation.
    - **Goals and success criteria**: The goal for platforms is to avoid severe penalties and maintain operational licenses. A target is to implement systems that can identify and block transactions linked to sanctioned addresses or known scam typologies with a high degree of accuracy, and to respond to law enforcement requests within short timeframes (e.g., 24-48 hours).
    - **Key constraints and resources**: Constraints include privacy laws, the need for user onboarding simplicity, and the cross-border nature of threats. Resources include blockchain analytics tools from vendors like Chainalysis and TRM Labs, AI monitoring tools, and the ability to share intelligence across the industry.
    - **Stakeholders and roles**: Stakeholders are digital asset platforms (must implement compliance), regulators and law enforcement (enforcing rules), and users (subject to enhanced KYC and affected by frozen assets).
    - **Time scale and impact scope**: This is an immediate and pressing operational risk. The impact scope is global, affecting all platforms that serve U.S. customers or operate in jurisdictions cooperating with U.S. authorities. Failure could result in massive fines, loss of banking partnerships, and shutdowns.
    - **Historical attempts and existing solutions (if any)**: Many platforms previously had basic KYC/AML checks. The existing solution is a rapid upgrade to compliance systems, including integrating advanced analytics, implementing robust IP monitoring, and establishing procedures for proactive cooperation with law enforcement.
    - **Known facts, assumptions, and uncertainties**: Facts: A DOJ strike force is active and has already seized hundreds of millions of dollars. OFAC is sanctioning entities involved in scams. Assumptions: Compliance standards will continue to tighten. Uncertainties: The ultimate cost of compliance and which specific red flags will be most critical for regulators.
