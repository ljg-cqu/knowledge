### Detailed Analysis of Dedicated RWA Blockchains

The following blockchains are purpose-built to facilitate the tokenization and management of real-world assets, offering specialized features for regulatory compliance, scalability, and integration with traditional finance:

#### XRP Ledger (XRPL)
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public Layer 1 blockchain specifically engineered for the creation, transfer, and exchange of digital assets in compliance with global regulatory standards. It has demonstrated over a decade of reliability, processing more than \\( \$1 \\) trillion in value with over 12 years of uptime and zero security breaches, making it a trusted platform for institutions. The XRPL is designed to facilitate Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization at an institutional scale, aiming to bridge traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi). Transactions on the XRPL achieve finality within 3-5 seconds and incur minimal costs, often less than a cent, ensuring high-speed and cost-effective asset transfers. It is capable of handling up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), supporting enterprise-grade applications and large-scale tokenization projects. The XRPL incorporates institutional-grade functionality for tokenization, trading, escrow, and payments. Its native support for tokens allows for the issuance of both XRP and custom tokens representing RWAs, managed through integrated tokenization tools that provide flexibility and control for issuers. Built-in compliance features, such as account freezing and transaction finality, ensure adherence to global regulatory standards. The platform also embeds verifiable asset details and compliance markers directly into tokens, streamlining operations and ensuring transparency. The XRPL's Decentralized Exchange (DEX) unifies Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pools and on-chain order books at the protocol layer to eliminate fragmentation and enhance baseline liquidity, offering a transparent and efficient marketplace for tokenized assets. Interoperability is a key feature, supporting seamless cross-chain movement between other leading tokens and blockchains, which expands the utility and accessibility of tokenized RWAs. Notable adoption includes Archax's plans to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized real-world assets onto the XRPL, and OpenEden introducing tokenized US Treasury Bills on the ledger, with their RWA value on XRPL surging from \\( \$5 \\) million to over \\( \$118 \\) million in July 2025. Furthermore, Ripple's partnership with Zoniqx leverages XRPL's infrastructure for a \\( \$1 \\) billion tokenized fund by Aurum Equity Partners, focusing on global data center development with enhanced liquidity, compliance, and security.
