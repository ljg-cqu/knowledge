## Requirements

### 1. Coverage & Organization

- **MECE Approach:** Cover all technical areas (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- **Elements:** Technical (techniques, algorithms, algorithm complexity profiles, protocols, patterns, best practices, frameworks, formulas, libraries, hardware requirements and optimizations including energy and resource consumption), theoretical (theories, principles, axioms, laws, assumptions, models), practical (regulations, market dynamics, permission/consensus governance, upgrade planning/rollback strategies, risks, costs, use cases)
- **Context:** Historical evolution, legal/regulatory landscape, future trends; key events and statistical data
- **Codebases & Libraries:** Identify authoritative repositories, SDKs, tooling suites, and audits; capture language support, licensing, maturity, integration hooks, distributed consistency models, and performance/security benchmarks.
- **Inference Lists:** Provide bullet summaries for adoption signals, interoperability impacts, roadmap implications, and operational risks per topic cluster.
- **Open Questions & Research:** Surface unresolved problems, knowledge gaps, emergent risks, and prioritized investigation tracks per topic cluster.
- **Authoritative Literature:** Distill takeaways from white/yellow papers, peer-reviewed studies, theses, market investigations, regulatory reports, books/manuals, and vetted encyclopedic resources; link claims to practical implementation guidance.
- **Critical Thinking Artifacts:** Capture explicit assumption lists, validation checks, counterexamples/edge cases, alternatives considered, and actionable conclusions for each topic cluster.
- **Collaboration & Organizational Dynamics:** Address cross-functional communication, governance models, institutional constraints, change management, and cultural alignment within teams and partner organizations.
- **Governance & Trust Dimensions:** Assess permission models vs. decentralization levels, trust guarantees, privacy/transparency balances, design-pattern choices, system error-tolerance expectations, and reliability/high-availability strategies.
- **Perspectives:** Engineering (front-end, back-end, full-stack), architecture & infrastructure (including hardware design, deployment, and energy/resource consumption), database & data engineering, quality assurance/testing, product management, project/program management, requirements/business analysis, operations & DevOps, marketing & go-to-market
- **Philosophical & Macro Disciplines:** Integrate philosophy (necessity vs. contingency, ethics, epistemology), economics, finance, capital markets (stock/crypto/commodity exchanges, liquidity, valuation), psychology, sociology, anthropology, law, policy, military strategy, education systems, and historical analysis across topic clusters.
- **Difficulty:** Foundational (20%), Intermediate (40%), Advanced (40%), grouped by topic

### 2. Content Design

- **Target:** Senior/expert level with deep technical understanding and broad strategic perspective
- **Evaluation:** Technical (throughput/latency performance, security, scalability, maintainability, reliability/HA) and business (cost, efficiency, impact, market fit) dimensions
- **Trade-offs:** Address essential/non-trivial trade-offs with decision-making guidance, including permissioning vs. decentralization choices, trust/privacy balances, algorithmic complexity limits, and upgrade path risks with mitigation strategies
- **Governance & Assurance:** Examine how permission boundaries, stakeholder trust models, privacy/transparency requirements, error-tolerance envelopes, and distributed consistency guarantees influence architectural options.
- **Macro Narratives:** Relate answers to systemic dynamics (economic cycles, stock/crypto market behaviors, liquidity and valuation trends, regulatory shifts, geopolitical/security considerations, societal adoption patterns, organizational behavior, historical precedents, macroeconomic/industry economic models).
- **Collaboration & Communication:** Surface stakeholder alignment plans, cross-team workflows, and communication cadences that impact execution quality.
- **Organizational & Strategic Operations:** Highlight business model implications, institutional capabilities, change readiness, and long-term strategic positioning.
- **Questions:** Mix theoretical, practical, and scenario-based on real-world applications
- **Answers:** 150-300 words with technical details, technologies, and practical examples; explain key concepts/terminologies clearly using analogies, formulas, etc. as needed

### 3. Execution

- **Planning:** Think carefully, reflect on thinking, create comprehensive plan before generation
- **Format:** Markdown with proper headings and code blocks
- **Clarification:** Include at least one mermaid diagram and one table per Q&A for clarity; also use code snippets, tables, analogies, comparisons, formulas, and diverse mermaid diagram types (structural: architecture, class, C4, ERD, block; behavioral: sequence, state, flowchart, data flow; project: Gantt, Kanban, user journey; analytical: charts, graphs, timelines, etc.). Mermaid portability: prefer avoiding edge labels and quote node labels containing special characters (parentheses, slashes).
- **Research:** Latest info from authoritative sources (official docs, white/yellow papers, academic theses, market investigations, audits, standards, books/manuals, curated wikis/encyclopedias, codebases); cross-reference multiple sources
- **Citations:** Include APA 7th edition references for all sourced material, aligning with the output template section.
- **Quality:** Ensure essential/valuable Q&A with high-quality output; apply creative then critical thinking; evaluate from multiple angles per the template's **Multi-Angle Evaluation** checklist (pros, cons, risks, benefits, alternatives, stakeholder emotional/psychological impact, market sentiment); verify accuracy, completeness, relevance, and MECE compliance
- **Holistic Reasoning:** Harmonize technical depth with philosophical rigor and macro-level insight; trace implications across disciplines while maintaining MECE clarity.
- **Navigation:** Add a compact "Contents" section near the top. Link to major sections
   (Executive Summary; Coverage & Difficulty; Glossary; How to Use; Key Decision Criteria
   checklist and matrix; each topic area header) and to every question (Q1–Q25) using
   GitHub-compatible anchors (lowercase, hyphens; punctuation removed). Optional: add
   a small "Back to top" link at the end of each question.
