#### Q20: What is a significant risk associated with bugs in deployed smart contracts? {#q20-what-is-a-significant-risk-associated-with-bugs-in-deployed-smart-contracts}

**Language** N/A  
**Difficulty** Intermediate  
**Bloom** Understand

**Stem** What is a significant risk associated with bugs in deployed smart contracts?

**Options**
- A. The blockchain automatically corrects the bug.
- B. The contract may behave incorrectly or be exploited, as it is immutable once deployed.
- C. The consensus mechanism ignores the bug.
- D. The contract is automatically undeployed and reset.

**Answer** B

**Rationale**
Correct (B) Bugs in smart contracts can lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation because smart contracts are immutable and cannot be modified once deployed, making proper auditing critical.

**Distractor notes**
- A: Blockchains do not automatically correct bugs in smart contracts.
- C: The consensus mechanism ensures the execution of the contract as coded, including any bugs.
- D: Smart contracts are generally immutable and cannot be simply undeployed and reset once on-chain.

#### Q21: How do "rollups" contribute to blockchain scalability? {#q21-how-do-rollups-contribute-to-blockchain-scalability}

**Language** N/A  
**Difficulty** Advanced  
**Bloom** Understand

**Stem** How do "rollups" contribute to blockchain scalability?

**Options**
- A. By replacing mining with staking.
- B. By increasing the size of individual blocks on the main chain.
- C. By bundling multiple transactions into a single batch for submission to the main blockchain, reducing its load.
- D. By creating private blockchain networks.

**Answer** C

**Rationale**
Correct (C) Rollups are Layer 2 solutions that aggregate multiple transactions into a single batch for submission to the main blockchain, which reduces the load on the main chain and increases scalability.

**Distractor notes**
- A: Replacing mining with staking (e.g., Proof of Stake) is a different scalability approach, not directly related to rollups.
- B: Increasing block size is a Layer 1 scalability solution that has its own trade-offs, and it's distinct from how rollups operate.
- D: Rollups are designed to scale existing blockchains, typically public ones, not to create separate private networks.

#### Q22: Which of the following is a benefit of blockchain technology in supply chain management? {#q22-which-of-the-following-is-a-benefit-of-blockchain-technology-in-supply-chain-management}

**Language** N/A  
**Difficulty** Intermediate  
**Bloom** Understand

**Stem** Which of the following is a benefit of blockchain technology in supply chain management?

**Options**
- A. To replace all supply chain personnel.
- B. To encrypt supply chain data only for security.
- C. To improve transparency and traceability of goods.
- D. To create new cryptocurrencies for supply chain payments.

**Answer** C

**Rationale**
Correct (C) Blockchain enhances supply chain management by improving the transparency and traceability of goods, providing a tamper-proof record of movement, which reduces fraud and inefficiencies.

**Distractor notes**
- A: Blockchain automates processes but does not aim to replace all personnel.
- B: While security through encryption is a benefit, the primary impact in supply chains is improved transparency and traceability, not just encryption.
- D: While payments are involved, the core benefit highlighted is transparency and traceability, not just creating new currencies.

#### Q23: What concept is foundational to blockchain, helping to eliminate single points of failure? {#q23-what-concept-is-foundational-to-blockchain-helping-to-eliminate-single-points-of-failure}

**Language** N/A  
**Difficulty** Advanced  
**Bloom** Understand

**Stem** What concept is foundational to blockchain, helping to eliminate single points of failure?

**Options**
- A. Centralized database management.
- B. Decentralization.
- C. Proprietary algorithms.
- D. High-speed processors.

**Answer** B

**Rationale**
Correct (B) Decentralization is the main advantage in blockchain as it reduces security risks by eliminating a single point of failure and distributing data across a network of nodes.

**Distractor notes**
- A: Centralized systems inherently have single points of failure, which blockchain aims to avoid.
- C: Proprietary algorithms might introduce centralization or lack transparency, contrary to the goal of eliminating single points of failure.
- D: High-speed processors can improve performance but do not inherently address the architectural issue of single points of failure.

#### Q24: What is the philosophical implication of a blockchain architect needing to be "the person who draws the line" (划线的人)? {#q24-what-is-the-philosophical-implication-of-a-blockchain-architect-needing-to-be-the-person-who-draws-the-line-划线的人}

**Language** N/A  
**Difficulty** Advanced  
**Bloom** Apply

**Stem** What is the philosophical implication of a blockchain architect needing to be "the person who draws the line" (划线的人)?

**Options**
- A. The architect must strictly adhere to all initial requirements without compromise.
- B. The architect must be able to identify the most critical problems and make necessary trade-offs and decisions given limited resources and infinite demands.
- C. The architect should only focus on minor technical details.
- D. The architect is responsible for dictating all team members' tasks without discussion.

**Answer** B

**Rationale**
Correct (B) Tan Dai's insight emphasizes that an architect operates with limited resources (human, machine) against unlimited demands (timeline, stability), thus necessitating the ability to identify critical points, make trade-offs, and find the optimal solution.

**Distractor notes**
- A: Architecture fundamentally involves trade-offs and compromises, not strict adherence to all requirements, which are often unbounded.
- C: An architect needs to understand details but also grasp the macro picture and strategic implications.
- D: While leadership is required, the "drawing the line" concept focuses on critical decision-making and problem-solving rather than just task delegation.

#### Q25: What key element distinguishes a hard fork in blockchain governance? {#q25-what-key-element-distinguishes-a-hard-fork-in-blockchain-governance}

**Language** N/A
