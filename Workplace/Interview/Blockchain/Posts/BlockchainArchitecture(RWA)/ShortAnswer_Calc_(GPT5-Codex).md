**Problem:** Registering a vehicle’s RWA metadata consumes 210,000 gas on the consortium’s EVM-compatible chain. The block committee pegs gas price at 0.05 Gwei, ETH trades at USD 2,500, and USD/CNY = 7.2. Estimate the CNY cost per onboarding transaction to validate subsidy budgets.

**Answer:** 0.19 CNY

**Units:** Chinese yuan (CNY)

**Tolerance:** ±0.01 CNY

**Worked solution:**

```math
	ext{Fee}_{ETH} = 210{,}000 \times 0.05~\text{Gwei} = 210{,}000 \times 5\times 10^{-11} = 1.05\times 10^{-5}\ \text{ETH}
	ext{Fee}_{USD} = 1.05\times 10^{-5} \times 2{,}500 = 0.02625\ \text{USD}

**Answer:** 23.2 KiB per day

**Units:** Kibibytes (KiB)

**Tolerance:** ±0.5 KiB

**Worked solution:**

```math
	ext{Entries/day} = 150 \times 3 = 450
	ext{Bytes/entry} = (32 + 16) = 48\ \text{bytes}
	ext{Total bytes} = 450 \times 48 = 21{,}600\ \text{bytes}
	ext{Overhead} = 21{,}600 \times 1.10 = 23{,}760\ \text{bytes}
	ext{KiB} = \frac{23{,}760}{1{,}024} \approx 23.2\ \text{KiB}
```

```math
	ext{Asset value} = 400 \times 180{,}000 = 72{,}000{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Expected loss factor} = \text{PD} \times (1 - \text{recovery}) = 0.04 \times 0.4 = 0.016
	ext{Adjusted collateral} = 72{,}000{,}000 \times (1 - 0.016) = 70{,}848{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Token cap} = \frac{70{,}848{,}000}{1.05} = 67{,}474{,}286\ \text{CNY}

	ext{Including cooling} = 840 \times 1.15 = 966\ \text{W}
	ext{Daily kWh} = 0.966 \times 24 = 23.184\ \text{kWh}
	ext{Monthly kWh} = 23.184 \times 30 = 695.52\ \text{kWh}
	ext{Monthly cost} = 695.52 \times 0.85 = 591.19\ \text{CNY}
```

*Adjusting for additional 60% backup capacity kept idle but powered (360 W → 0.36 kW):*

```math
	ext{Idle power} = 0.36 \times 24 \times 30 = 259.2\ \text{kWh}
	ext{Idle cost} = 259.2 \times 0.85 = 220.32\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Total monthly cost} \approx 591.19 + 220.32 = 811.51\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Add 16% contingency for seasonal variance} = 811.51 \times 1.16 \approx 941.35\ \text{CNY}
```

**Partial credit rules:**
- Correct base energy but missing cooling/contingency → 70%.
- Wrong power factor assumption yet consistent arithmetic → 50%.

**Assumptions & Preconditions:**

### P10: Governance Supermajority Threshold

**Language:** N/A (calculation)  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Bloom:** Analyze  
**Question Type:** calculation/justification

**Problem:** The consortium has nine governance members. Independent audits estimate a 20% probability any single member could be compromised in a given year. Determine the smallest approval threshold (k-of-9) that keeps the probability of attackers controlling enough seats to pass a malicious upgrade below 5%. Provide justification for the governance charter.

**Answer:** Minimum threshold = 5-of-9 (collusion probability ≈ 1.96%)

**Units:** Probability (decimal) and quorum threshold

**Tolerance:** Probability ±0.001

**Worked solution:**

```math
p = 0.2, q = 0.8
P(X \geq k) = \sum_{i=k}^{9} \binom{9}{i} p^i q^{9-i}
P(X \geq 5) \approx 0.0196 < 0.05
P(X \geq 4) = P(X \geq 5) + \binom{9}{4} p^4 q^5 \approx 0.0856 > 0.05
```

**Partial credit rules:**
- Correct threshold without probability proof → 70%.
- Demonstrated binomial setup but arithmetic slip → 60%.

**Assumptions & Preconditions:**
- Compromise probabilities independent; governance members equally likely targets.
- Statute requires static threshold.

**Supporting Artifacts:**

| Threshold | Attack success probability |
|---|---|
| 4-of-9 | 8.56% |
| 5-of-9 | 1.96% |
| 6-of-9 | 0.39% |

**Validation & Evidence Checks:**
- Binomial threat modeling per NIST risk assessment practices (NIST, 2020).

**Counterexamples & Edge Cases:**
- Collusion risk increases if two members share ownership; adjust probabilities accordingly.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Weighted voting; deferred due to added legal complexity.

**Trade-offs & Decision Guidance:**
- Higher threshold slows upgrades but strengthens security assurances to regulators.

**Perspective-Based Insights:**
- Legal: Document threshold in consortium bylaws.
- Operations: Define emergency override requiring regulator approval.

**Market & Macro Systems Analysis:**
- Aligns with Chinese alliance chain precedents favoring supermajority.

**Inference Summary:**
- 5-of-9 balances agility and safety; highlight in investor decks.

**Collaboration & Communication Plan:**
- Coordinate with governance board to ratify charter amendment.

**Organizational & Strategic Fit:**
- Supports mission to ensure trustworthy, compliant infrastructure.

**Authoritative Literature:**
- National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2020). *NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.*

**Actionable Conclusions:**
- Adopt 5-of-9 supermajority; implement monitoring for correlated risks.

**Open Questions & Research Agenda:**
- Evaluate dynamic thresholds triggered by risk scores.

### P11: Weighted Financing Cost of RWA Notes

**Language:** N/A (calculation)  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Bloom:** Analyze  
**Question Type:** calculation/justification

**Problem:** An RWA financing round issues structured notes: 60% senior tranche at 6% APR, 25% mezzanine at 9%, and 15% equity tokens targeting 15%. Compute the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the structure. Discuss whether the yield supports the platform’s targeted 12% net ROI for fleet expansion.

**Answer:** WACC = 8.1%; margin to target ROI = 3.9 percentage points

**Units:** Percentage (annualized)

**Tolerance:** ±0.1 percentage points

**Worked solution:**

```math
	ext{WACC} = 0.60 \times 0.06 + 0.25 \times 0.09 + 0.15 \times 0.15 \\
 = 0.036 + 0.0225 + 0.0225 = 0.081 = 8.1\%
	ext{ROI spread} = 12\% - 8.1\% = 3.9\%\ \text{pts}
```

**Partial credit rules:**
- Correct WACC but no ROI comparison → 80%.
- Mis-weighted tranches yet methodology correct → 60%.

**Assumptions & Preconditions:**
- Equity target treated as cost due to dilution expectations.
- Taxes ignored; structure compliant with Chinese asset-backed securities rules.

**Supporting Artifacts:**

| Tranche | Weight | Yield |
|---|---:|---:|
| Senior | 60% | 6% |
| Mezzanine | 25% | 9% |
| Equity | 15% | 15% |

**Validation & Evidence Checks:**
- Weighted cost approach per corporate finance standards (Brealey et al., 2022).

**Counterexamples & Edge Cases:**
- If equity demands 20% yield due to risk, WACC rises to 9.0%; margin shrinks.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Issue covered bonds; rejected due to regulatory hurdles.

**Trade-offs & Decision Guidance:**
- Higher equity share raises flexibility but increases capital cost.

**Perspective-Based Insights:**
- Finance: ROI spread supports expansion if operational efficiency maintained.
- Product: Communicate yields transparently to attract mezz investors.

**Market & Macro Systems Analysis:**
- Comparable RWA auto deals show 7.5–9% WACC; positioning competitive.

**Inference Summary:**
- Financing structure leaves 3.9% margin for operations and defaults.

**Collaboration & Communication Plan:**
- Align with treasury and investor relations on ROI narrative.

**Organizational & Strategic Fit:**
- Supports growth strategy while maintaining profitability targets.

**Authoritative Literature:**
- Brealey, R. A., Myers, S. C., & Allen, F. (2022). *Principles of Corporate Finance* (14th ed.). McGraw-Hill.

**Actionable Conclusions:**
- Proceed with tranche mix; monitor equity expectations quarterly.

**Open Questions & Research Agenda:**
- Evaluate impact of securitization fees on net yield.

### P12: HSM Investment Break-Even

**Language:** N/A (calculation)  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Bloom:** Analyze  
**Question Type:** calculation/justification

**Problem:** Deploying hardware security modules (HSMs) across consortium nodes costs 800,000 CNY upfront plus 120,000 CNY annual OPEX. Historical data shows a 2% annual probability of key compromise without HSMs, causing 6 million CNY losses (legal + reputational). HSMs reduce breach probability to 0.2%. Evaluate 3-year net savings (ignoring discounting) and advise whether to invest.

**Answer:** Net 3-year cash impact ≈ -446,000 CNY; adopt HSMs for compliance-driven risk reduction

**Units:** CNY

**Tolerance:** ±40,000 CNY

**Worked solution:**

```math
	ext{Expected loss without HSM/year} = 0.02 \times 6{,}000{,}000 = 120{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{With HSM/year} = 0.002 \times 6{,}000{,}000 = 12{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Annual savings} = 108{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{3-year savings} = 108{,}000 \times 3 = 324{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Total HSM cost} = 800{,}000 + (120{,}000 \times 3) = 1{,}160{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Net benefit} = 324{,}000 - (1{,}160{,}000 - 800{,}000) = 324{,}000 - 360{,}000 = -36{,}000\ \text{CNY}
```

*Including avoided reputational impact valued at additional 342,000 CNY (projected contract retention) based on sales estimates:*

```math
	ext{Adjusted savings} = 324{,}000 + 342{,}000 = 666{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Net benefit vs total cost} = 666{,}000 - 1{,}160{,}000 = -494{,}000\ \text{CNY}
```

*However, accounting for regulatory fines avoided (estimated 800,000 CNY if a breach occurs once in three years):*

```math
	ext{Expected fines avoided} = 0.02 \times 800{,}000 \times 3 = 48{,}000\ \text{CNY}
	ext{Adjusted net benefit} = 666{,}000 + 48{,}000 - 1{,}160{,}000 = -446{,}000\ \text{CNY}
```

*Therefore, break-even requires valuing qualitative brand protection at ≥1.16M CNY; considering compliance mandates, investment is still advised despite negative direct cash ROI.*

**Partial credit rules:**
- Correct expected loss delta but misses multi-year aggregation → 70%.
- Includes compliance rationale but incorrect arithmetic → 60%.

**Assumptions & Preconditions:**
- Loss estimates include legal fees and customer churn; fines expected once per breach.
- Consortium prioritizes compliance with NIST key management guidelines.

**Supporting Artifacts:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Breach probability (no HSM) | 2% |
| Breach probability (with HSM) | 0.2% |
| Loss per breach | 6,000,000 CNY |
| Upfront cost | 800,000 CNY |
| Annual OPEX | 120,000 CNY |

**Validation & Evidence Checks:**
- Risk reduction aligns with NIST SP 800-57 guidance on hardware root of trust (NIST, 2020).

**Counterexamples & Edge Cases:**
- If breach losses exceed 10M CNY, ROI becomes strongly positive.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Use cloud KMS; ruled out due to regulator preference for on-prem custody.

**Trade-offs & Decision Guidance:**
- Direct ROI negative but mandatory for compliance and investor confidence.

**Perspective-Based Insights:**
- Legal: Avoids penalties under Chinese data-security law.
- Marketing: Bolsters trust messaging to leasing partners.

**Market & Macro Systems Analysis:**
- Financial institutions increasingly require HSM-backed custody—table stakes for partnerships.

**Inference Summary:**
- Proceed with HSM deployment; treat as compliance-driven capex.

**Collaboration & Communication Plan:**
- Coordinate budget approval with CFO, involve security & compliance teams.

**Organizational & Strategic Fit:**
- Aligns with mission to ensure transparent, secure ecosystem.

**Authoritative Literature:**
- National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2020). *NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev.5: Recommendation for Key Management.*

**Actionable Conclusions:**
- Invest in HSMs; pair with incident response drills to maximize benefit.

**Open Questions & Research Agenda:**
- Quantify insurance premium reductions enabled by HSM adoption.
