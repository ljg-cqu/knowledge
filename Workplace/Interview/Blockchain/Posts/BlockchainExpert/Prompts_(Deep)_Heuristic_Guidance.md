# Prompts (Deep) - Heuristic Guidance

## Scope

Provide question-only prompt lists for each Q&A covering creative, deep/critical, reflective, systems, design, strategic, lateral, ethical, scenario-planning, computational, meta-cognitive, dialectical, first-principles, and probabilistic thinking. Supply at least three questions per mode (five recommended) to encourage self-directed exploration.

## Question Modes

### Creative Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) open-ended questions to stimulate creative ideas and innovative approaches.

### Deep Thinking (Critical Thinking) Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions for analytical, critical, and reflective thinking, such as examining assumptions, biases, and implications.

### Reflective Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions for self-assessment, personal growth, and learning from experience.

### Systems Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions for understanding interconnections, holistic impacts, and systemic relationships.

### Design Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions for user-centered innovation, empathy, and iterative design.

### Strategic Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions for long-term vision, competitive advantage, and scenario planning.

### Lateral Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions that reframe constraints, explore analogies, or propose unconventional alternatives.

### Ethical Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions examining moral obligations, stakeholder ethics, and responsible conduct.

### Scenario Planning Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions probing future what-if situations, contingencies, and resilience strategies.

### Computational Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions about decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic reasoning.

### Meta-Cognitive Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions encouraging monitoring of reasoning quality, biases, and learning reflections.

### Dialectical Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions contrasting opposing viewpoints and synthesizing resolutions.

### First-Principles Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions that strip assumptions to fundamentals before reconstructing solutions.

### Probabilistic Thinking Prompts
- Provide ≥3 (recommend 5) questions assessing likelihoods, uncertainties, evidence strength, and risk distributions.
