1. Q: Statement: "The GG18/GG20 Paillier modulus issue only lets attackers slightly bias signatures; it never leads to full private key extraction, so we can schedule an upgrade in the distant future." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The statement fatally understates the risk. Public technical reports show that the "6ix1een"-style Paillier modulus vulnerability can allow **full private key extraction** from GG18/GG20-based wallets using as few as 16 signatures if moduli are not properly generated and checked. A correct plan is to (a) immediately audit all GG18/GG20 uses, (b) either upgrade to hardened protocols such as MPC-CMP / CGGMP21 with zero‑knowledge range proofs and proactive key refresh, or add the missing ZK checks, and (c) rotate affected keys on a strict timeline.

1. Q: Statement: "Our CI pipeline uses `tokio-tar`, but it only runs inside our build network, so the TARmageddon CVE-2025-62518 cannot lead to remote code execution and we don’t need to touch it." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: This assumes isolation eliminates supply-chain risk. The TARmageddon advisory explains that malicious archives can smuggle paths that overwrite configs or build artifacts even inside internal pipelines, enabling RCE or backdoored binaries. The fix described in the news briefings is to (a) inventory all usages of `tokio-tar` / `async-tar`, (b) migrate to the maintained `astral-tokio-tar` v0.5.6 where the CVE is patched, and (c) add CI checks to block re‑introduction of abandoned crates.

1. Q: Statement: "MiCA only regulates centralized exchanges and custodians that directly hold users’ private keys; MPC wallets that just keep one key share for the user are purely non-custodial and fall completely outside MiCA." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The summary misreads custody definitions. The MiCA and CLARITY‑style analyses in the briefings treat **holding even one key share as custody** when a provider can influence movement of client assets. MPC wallets with a 2-of-3 split where the provider owns one share can still be CASPs and must meet custody, segregation, and KYC/AML requirements. The corrected approach is to (a) map our MPC architecture to MiCA custody definitions, (b) decide between own CASP license, sublicensing, or non‑EU strategy, and (c) redesign key‑share policies and on/off‑chain ledgers to satisfy asset segregation rules.

1. Q: Statement: "Switching from GG20 to newer schemes like CGGMP21 or Trout mostly changes the math on paper; end‑user UX barely moves, so we shouldn’t spend engineering time on it." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: This ignores the quantified latency and security gains documented in the news briefings. CGGMP21 and Trout reduce online signing to one or two rounds and cut signing latency by ~40–60% or about 3x in some Rust benchmarks, while adding identifiable abort and stronger malicious‑security guarantees. For mobile MPC wallets, that difference is the line between 1.2s and ~700ms (or even sub‑200ms) p95 latency. A better decision is to treat protocol choice as user‑visible performance and safety work, plan a staged migration (R&D → canary → full rollout), and budget engineering time accordingly.

1. Q: Statement: "Because Fireblocks open‑sourced MPC‑CMP, the safest move is to refactor our entire signing service to CMP and flip 100% of production traffic at once—shadow traffic or canary routing will only slow us down." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: This reverses the risk logic. The TechOps briefings explicitly recommend **shadow or canary deployments** (for example, 30% traffic for a month) to benchmark latency and error rates before full cut‑over. Jumping directly to 100% traffic on a new cryptographic core risks outages and subtle bugs in keygen, preprocessing, or signing. The corrected plan is to (a) benchmark CMP in isolation, (b) route a limited canary fraction with tight SLOs and rollback, (c) only promote to full traffic once metrics match or beat the old path.

1. Q: Statement: "Given the $87M Solana wallet drains, the only realistic way to protect users is to drop Solana support entirely; transaction simulation and previews can’t materially change the risk." What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The Solana analysis shows the exploits abused **missing or opaque simulation**, and that 67% of victims used wallets without clear previews. The recommended mitigation is not to abandon Solana, but to (a) integrate robust simulation APIs, (b) show explicit asset‑level diffs for each instruction, and (c) enforce stricter UX for large transfers (e.g., mandatory expanded detail for >$1K). That preserves product roadmap value (ARR from Solana‑demanding clients) while materially reducing real‑world exploit risk.
