────────────────────────────
SECTION I: FOUNDATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & SYSTEMS DESIGN (15 Q&As)
────────────────────────────

1. Q: Explain the difference between a process and a thread.
   A: A process is an independent instance of a program with its own memory space and resources. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares the process's memory and resources.

2. Q: What is virtual memory, and why is it important?
   A: Virtual memory allows an operating system to use disk storage as an extension of physical RAM, enabling efficient memory management and multitasking by isolating processes.

3. Q: Describe the OSI model and its relevance.
   A: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a 7-layer abstraction for networking that standardizes how data travels from one device to another. It helps in troubleshooting, designing, and implementing network protocols.

4. Q: What are the differences between TCP and UDP?
   A: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) offers reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery over a connection, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, faster, and does not guarantee delivery or order.

5. Q: Explain the concept of hashing and its role in blockchain.
   A: Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256). In blockchain, hashing secures blocks and transactions by ensuring data integrity.

6. Q: What is cryptography, and how does it secure blockchain transactions?
   A: Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms to secure data. In blockchain, it secures transactions by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (e.g., using digital signatures).

7. Q: What are consensus mechanisms, and why are they critical in blockchain systems?
   A: Consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake) enable distributed networks to agree on a single state of the blockchain, ensuring trust and security in decentralized environments.

8. Q: Compare centralized and decentralized systems.
   A: Centralized systems have a single point of control, which can simplify management but create vulnerabilities. Decentralized systems distribute control among many nodes, enhancing resilience and transparency.

9. Q: Define immutability in the context of blockchain.
   A: Immutability means that once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be changed. This property ensures data integrity and trust in the ledger.

10. Q: What is a digital signature, and how does it ensure authenticity?
    A: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that verifies the sender’s identity and the integrity of the message. It uses a private key to sign and a public key for verification.

11. Q: What are common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs?
    A: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory. Linked lists store elements as nodes with pointers. Trees represent hierarchical data, while graphs depict relationships between nodes.

12. Q: Explain Big O notation and its significance.
    A: Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm’s performance (time/space complexity) as the input size increases, helping developers assess efficiency.

13. Q: Name several sorting algorithms and their time complexities.
    A: Bubble Sort (O(n²)), Merge Sort (O(n log n)), and Quick Sort (average O(n log n)) are common examples.

14. Q: What is the CAP theorem, and what implications does it have for distributed systems?
    A: The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can guarantee at most two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. This influences design decisions in distributed architectures.

15. Q: What are the key considerations when designing an efficient, scalable blockchain solution?
    A: Considerations include consensus protocols, data sharding, network topology, state synchronization, and efficient consensus to handle high throughput and latency.

19. Q: What is the difference between `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex`?
    A: `sync.Mutex` provides exclusive access (one writer), while `sync.RWMutex` allows multiple readers or one writer concurrently, which is useful when reads are frequent.

20. Q: How do you handle race conditions in Go?
    A: Use synchronization primitives like channels, mutexes, atomic operations, and the race detector (`go run -race`) for debugging.

21. Q: Describe how the `select` statement is used in concurrent Go programs.
    A: The `select` statement listens on multiple channels and executes the corresponding case when a value is received, similar to a switch for channels.

22. Q: What is a rate limiter, and how might you implement one in Go?
    A: A rate limiter restricts the number of operations over time. It can be implemented using tokens in a channel that are replenished at a fixed rate.

    A: `go mod` manages dependencies, versions, and reproducible builds in Go projects, ensuring consistent builds across environments.

31. Q: Describe Go’s approach to error handling.
    A: Go uses explicit error returns from functions. Instead of exceptions, errors are returned as values, encouraging clear handling of failure conditions.

32. Q: How does reflection work in Go?
    A: Reflection in Go allows inspection and modification of values at runtime. It’s useful for generic operations, but with potential performance overhead.

33. Q: What is the significance of the `defer` keyword in Go?
    A: `defer` postpones execution of a function until the surrounding function completes, useful for cleanup tasks such as closing files or releasing locks.

34. Q: How do you use the built-in testing framework in Go?
    A: Write tests in files ending in `_test.go` using the `testing` package, and use `go test` to run them, ensuring code correctness and regression prevention.

35. Q: What are some advanced concurrency patterns in Go?
    A: Patterns include worker pools, fan-in/fan-out, pipelines, and using context for cancellation. These patterns help manage complex concurrent workflows efficiently.

52. Q: Explain Rust’s ownership and borrowing system.
    A: The ownership system ensures memory safety by enforcing that each value has a single owner and that borrowing rules (mutable vs. immutable) prevent data races.

53. Q: What is a lifetime in Rust, and why is it important?
    A: Lifetimes are compile-time constructs that ensure references remain valid. They prevent dangling pointers by enforcing that no reference outlives the data it points to.

54. Q: How do traits in Rust work, and what benefits do they provide?
    A: Traits define a set of behaviors or methods that types can implement. They enable polymorphism, code reuse, and compile-time guarantees of behavior.

55. Q: How does Rust handle error handling?
    A: Rust uses the `Result` type and the `?` operator to propagate errors explicitly, favoring explicit error handling over exceptions.

56. Q: What is Cargo, and how does it benefit Rust development?
    A: Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. It manages dependencies, builds projects, and runs tests, streamlining development workflows.

57. Q: Compare Rust’s concurrency model with that of Go.
    A: Rust’s concurrency model enforces memory safety at compile time via ownership and borrowing, while Go uses lightweight goroutines and channels. Rust gives more control and safety at the cost of a steeper learning curve.
