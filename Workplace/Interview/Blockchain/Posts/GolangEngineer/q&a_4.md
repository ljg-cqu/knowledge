## 1️⃣ Go (Golang) – Core Language & Concurrency  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **G1** | What are the three ways to synchronize goroutine execution? | Knowledge of Go’s concurrency primitives. | 1️⃣ Channels 2️⃣ `sync.WaitGroup` 3️⃣ `sync.Mutex` / `sync.RWMutex` (or atomic ops). |
| **G2** | Explain the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels. | Understanding of back‑pressure & blocking semantics. | Unbuffered: send blocks until a receiver is ready. Buffered: send blocks only when the buffer is full; receive blocks when empty. |
| **G3** | What is the `select` statement used for? | Ability to multiplex multiple channel operations. | Waits on several channel ops, picks one that’s ready; can have a `default` case for non‑blocking. |
| **G4** | How does Go’s memory model guarantee visibility between goroutines? | Knowledge of data races, happens‑before relationship. | Writes become visible after a **synchronization event** (channel send/receive, lock unlock, atomic op, etc.). |
| **G5** | When would you use `sync/atomic` instead of a mutex? | Performance awareness. | For simple counters / flag checks where lock‑contention would be costly; atomic ops avoid kernel‑mode lock overhead but work only on single‑word values. |
| **G6** | Explain the “worker‑pool” pattern in Go and why it’s useful for a matching engine. | Ability to design high‑throughput systems. | Fixed number of goroutine workers read jobs from a buffered channel, limiting concurrency, preventing goroutine explosion, and controlling resource usage. |
| **G7** | What are `context.Context` and why is it important in a distributed system? | Proper cancellation / timeout propagation. | Carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and request‑scoped values across API boundaries – essential to stop work when a request is aborted. |
| **G8** | How does Go’s garbage collector work and how can you tune it for low‑latency services? | Understanding of GC impact on latency. | Concurrent, tri‑color mark‑and‑sweep collector. Tune via `GOGC` (heap‑growth target), `GODEBUG=gctrace=1`, reduce allocations (reuse objects, `sync.Pool`). |
| **G9** | What is a “goroutine leak” and how do you detect it? | Code‑quality awareness. | A goroutine blocks forever (e.g., waiting on a channel that never receives). Detect with `go test -race`, runtime/pprof goroutine profiles, or explicit logging of entry/exit. |
| **G10** | Explain the “pipeline” pattern and give a concrete example relevant to a trading engine. | Ability to compose streaming stages. | Each stage is a goroutine reading from an input channel, processing, then writing to an output channel. Example: `parse → validate → match → persist`. |
| **G11** | What are the trade‑offs between using channels vs. a shared data structure protected by a mutex? | Design reasoning. | Channels promote message‑passing, avoid explicit locks, easier to reason about. For ultra‑high‑frequency data structures (order books) a lock‑protected shared map/heap may be faster because of less copying. |
| **G12** | Give an example of how you would implement a rate‑limiter in Go. | Practical problem‑solving. | Token‑bucket using a `time.Ticker` that fills a channel of capacity *N*; each request does a non‑blocking receive. |
| **G13** | What is the purpose of `sync.Pool` and when should you use it? | Memory‑reuse knowledge. | Provides per‑CPU caches of temporary objects to reduce GC pressure. Use for short‑lived, frequently allocated objects (buffers, request structs). |
| **G14** | Explain Go’s `defer` semantics and its impact on performance. | Language detail. | `defer` schedules a function call to run after the surrounding function returns; the call is stacked. Overhead is small (~dozens of ns) but may be avoided in hot loops. |

## 2️⃣ Databases – MySQL & Redis  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **DB1** | Explain the ACID properties of a transaction. | Fundamentals. | **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability. |
| **DB2** | What isolation levels does InnoDB support and which one would you pick for an order‑matching engine? | Knowledge of trade‑offs. | READ‑UNCOMMITTED, READ‑COMMITTED, REPEATABLE‑READ (default), SERIALIZABLE. For matching you usually need **SERIALIZABLE** or **REPEATABLE‑READ** with explicit row‑level locking (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`). |
| **DB3** | How does InnoDB implement row‑level locking? | Internals. | Uses a B‑Tree index and a lock table. `UPDATE` / `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` acquire exclusive locks on the index records they touch; other transactions wait. |
| **DB4** | What is a “deadlock” in MySQL and how does the server resolve it? | Operational awareness. | Two (or more) transactions each hold locks the other needs → circular wait. InnoDB detects deadlock via a wait‑for graph and aborts the **victim** (usually the transaction with the lowest cost). |
| **DB5** | Explain the difference between `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` and `INSERT IGNORE`. | Upsert patterns. | `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` updates the existing row if a PK/unique conflict occurs. `INSERT IGNORE` silently discards the row on conflict (no error, no update). |
| **DB6** | When would you use a MySQL stored procedure vs. handling logic in Go? | Architecture decision. | Stored procedures reduce round‑trips for set‑based ops, but are harder to version‑control and test. Prefer Go for business logic; use SPs only for heavy data‑massaging that benefits from being close to the data. |
| **DB7** | How do you design a schema for an order‑book (limit orders) that supports fast matching? | Data‑modeling. | Table `orders` (id, user_id, side, price, qty, remaining, status, created_at). **Composite index** on `(side, price, created_at)` gives price‑time priority. Add a covering index on `(price, remaining)` for quick range scans. |
| **DB8** | What are the trade‑offs of using MySQL vs. a NoSQL store for caching order‑book snapshots? | System design. | MySQL gives strong consistency and SQL querying but higher latency. NoSQL (Redis) offers in‑memory speed and pub/sub, but only eventual consistency and limited query power. Use Redis for hot‑path reads, MySQL for persistence. |
| **DB9** | Explain Redis persistence options and which you would enable for a trading platform. | Reliability. | **RDB** snapshots (periodic) – good for backups but can lose recent writes. **AOF** (append‑only file) – logs every write; can be set to `appendfsync everysec` for near‑real‑time durability. For a trading platform enable **AOF** + periodic RDB. |
| **DB10** | How does Redis implement pub/sub and what are its limitations? | Messaging. | Publisher writes to a channel; all subscribers receive the message instantly. Limitations: no persistence, no guaranteed delivery, no ordering across multiple Redis nodes (needs clustering). |
| **DB11** | What is a Redis “sorted set” and how can it be used for an order‑book? | Data structure. | Sorted set maps *member → score* and keeps members sorted by score. Use price as the score, order‑id as the member; `ZRANGE` retrieves best bid/ask in O(log N). |
| **DB12** | How would you implement a distributed lock with Redis? | Coordination. | Use **Redlock** (multiple independent Redis nodes) or a single‑node lock: `SET key value NX PX ttl`. Store a unique token as the value and release only if the token matches (via a Lua script). |
| **DB13** | What is the purpose of `sync.Pool` in Go and why might you use it with Redis connections? | Resource reuse. | Caches objects for reuse, reducing GC pressure. You can keep a pool of `redis.Conn` objects so you don’t dial the server for every request. |
| **DB14** | Explain the “Read‑Write split” pattern with MySQL + Redis. | Architecture. | Writes go to MySQL (source of truth). After commit, the updated data is written to Redis (cache) either synchronously or via a background worker. Reads first check Redis; on miss they fallback to MySQL and repopulate the cache. |
| **DB15** | How would you detect and mitigate “cache stampede” in Redis? | Reliability. | Use **lock‑first** (`SETNX` lock), **request coalescing**, or **randomized TTL**. A common pattern is Go’s `singleflight` – only one request rebuilds the cache while others wait. |

## 3️⃣ Distributed System Design – High‑Concurrency Trading Engine  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **DS1** | Describe the end‑to‑end flow of a limit order from receipt to settlement. | Ability to map domain to system components. | 1️⃣ API gateway receives request → 2️⃣ Validation & auth (Go service). 3️⃣ Order placed on a persistent queue (Kafka/NATS). 4️⃣ Matching engine (in‑memory order book) consumes, matches, creates trades. 5️⃣ Trades are written to MySQL (ledger) and published to Redis (real‑time market data). 6️⃣ Settlement service debits/credits balances, writes to DB, emits events for downstream accounting. |
| **DS2** | How would you design a lock‑free order‑book data structure in Go? | Low‑latency design. | Use a **skip‑list** (or a concurrent B‑tree) where each price level is a node containing a lock‑free FIFO list of orders. Insert/remove via `atomic.CompareAndSwapPointer`. |
| **DS3** | What is the “C10K problem” and how does Go help solve it? | Scalability. | C10K = handling 10 000 concurrent connections. Go’s lightweight goroutines + netpoller let you spawn one goroutine per connection without exhausting OS threads. |
| **DS4** | Explain the difference between “vertical scaling” and “horizontal scaling”. | Architecture basics. | **Vertical** – add more CPU/RAM to a single node (limited ceiling). **Horizontal** – add more nodes behind a load balancer (near‑linear capacity increase, fault tolerance). |
| **DS5** | What CAP‑theorem trade‑offs would you consider for a distributed order‑book cache? | Distributed data reasoning. | **Consistency vs Availability** when a network partition occurs. For market‑data cache you favor **Availability** (serve quotes) with **eventual consistency**; for balances you need **strong consistency**. |
| **DS6** | How would you achieve exactly‑once processing of orders from a message queue? | Reliability. | Use **idempotent order IDs** with a unique DB constraint. Consume, attempt to insert; if conflict → already processed. Combine with the **transactional outbox** pattern (write state + event in same DB transaction). |
| **DS7** | What is a “CQRS” pattern and is it suitable for a trading platform? | Architectural style. | **Command‑Query Responsibility Segregation** separates write path (commands) from read path (queries). Very suitable: commands go through the matching engine; queries read from a read‑optimized view (Redis, Elasticsearch). |
| **DS8** | Explain the role of a “circuit breaker” and where you would place it in the stack. | Fault tolerance. | Prevents cascading failures by short‑circuiting calls after a threshold of errors. Place it around external services (price feeds, DB connections) using a library like `sony/gobreaker`. |
| **DS9** | How would you design a “hot‑key” mitigation strategy for a popular trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT)? | Load‑balancing. | 1️⃣ Shard the order book by price range or user ID. 2️⃣ Use consistent hashing for request routing. 3️⃣ Deploy multiple matching‑engine instances behind a front‑end that partitions orders. 4️⃣ Apply per‑user rate‑limiting. |
| **DS10** | What is “back‑pressure” and how is it implemented in Go? | Flow control. | Signals the producer to slow down when the consumer can’t keep up. In Go a **bounded buffered channel** provides automatic back‑pressure – `send` blocks when the buffer is full. |
| **DS11** | Describe the “outbox pattern” and why it’s useful for event‑driven architecture. | Reliability. | Writes state changes *and* events to the same DB transaction (outbox table). A separate poller reads the outbox and publishes to a message bus, guaranteeing that either both DB state and event are persisted or none. |
| **DS12** | What is a “sharding key” and how would you pick one for user balances? | Data partitioning. | Choose a key that distributes load evenly and is stable. For balances, **user_id** (or a hash of it) works because each user’s balance is independent. |
| **DS13** | Explain the difference between “stateful” and “stateless” services. Give an example from a trading system. | Service design. | Stateless services don’t keep client‑specific data between requests (e.g., API gateway that just validates signatures). Stateful services hold domain state (e.g., matching engine that keeps the in‑memory order book). |
| **DS14** | How would you monitor latency of order matching? | Observability. | Instrument entry/exit timestamps with OpenTelemetry; export a **histogram** metric to Prometheus; set alerts on 99th‑percentile exceeding a threshold; visualise in Grafana. |
| **DS15** | What are “idempotency keys” and where would you apply them? | API design. | A client‑generated unique token attached to a request. The server stores the key + result; repeated requests with the same key return the stored result. Critical for order placement where clients may retry after a timeout. |
| **DS16** | Explain the “two‑phase commit” and why you might avoid it in a high‑throughput system. | Transaction coordination. | 2PC prepares all participants, then commits. It blocks resources during the prepare phase, causing high latency and a single point of failure. In high‑throughput trading we prefer **eventual consistency** with idempotent writes. |
| **DS17** | How do you handle “cold start” of a new matching‑engine node? | Deployment. | Load balancer routes new orders to a standby node; the node loads the latest order‑book snapshot from persistent storage (MySQL + Redis) and starts processing. Use a **snapshot + delta log** to minimise sync time. |
| **DS18** | What is “linearizability” and is it required for a trade‑ledger? | Consistency model. | Linearizability = operations appear to occur atomically at some point between invocation and response. For a trade‑ledger (financial record) you need **strong (linearizable) consistency** to guarantee correct balances. |
| **DS19** | Why would you choose a micro‑service architecture vs. a monolith for this project? | System design rationale. | Micro‑services let you scale each bounded context (matching, settlement, market‑data) independently and isolate failures, but add operational complexity. A monolith may be acceptable for a small MVP; micro‑services are preferred for production‑grade, high‑scale platforms. |
| **DS20** | How would you implement a “graceful shutdown” of a matching engine? | Ops. | Stop accepting new orders, drain the in‑flight order channel, wait for all workers (`sync.WaitGroup`) to finish, persist final order‑book state, then exit. Handle OS `SIGTERM`. |

## 4️⃣ Blockchain & Smart Contracts (Solidity)  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **BC1** | What are the three main components of a blockchain? | Fundamentals. | 1️⃣ Data (blocks) 2️⃣ Consensus algorithm 3️⃣ P2P network. |
| **BC2** | Explain how a Merkle tree works and why it is useful. | Cryptography. | Binary tree where leaves are hashes of transactions; internal nodes hash concatenated children. Provides O(log n) proof of inclusion (Merkle proof) and tamper‑evidence. |
| **BC3** | What is the difference between UTXO and account‑based models? | Model knowledge. | **UTXO** (Bitcoin) – coins are unspent transaction outputs, enabling parallel verification. **Account‑based** (Ethereum) – global state map of balances, enabling smart contracts. |
| **BC4** | Describe the steps a transaction goes through from submission to finality on Ethereum. | End‑to‑end flow. | 1️⃣ Signed tx sent to node. 2️⃣ Node validates nonce, gas, signature. 3️⃣ Enters mempool. 4️⃣ Miner picks tx, executes in EVM (state changes). 5️⃣ Block sealed & broadcast. 6️⃣ After *N* confirmations (depends on chain) block is considered final. |
| **BC5** | What is gas and why is it needed? | Resource accounting. | Gas measures computational work. Users pay gas (converted to ETH) to prevent DoS, incentivise miners, and price‑differentiate operations. |
| **BC6** | Give an example of a re‑entrancy attack and how to mitigate it. | Security. | Attack: malicious contract’s fallback repeatedly calls back into vulnerable contract before state is updated (e.g., DAO). Mitigation: **checks‑effects‑interactions** pattern, `ReentrancyGuard` (mutex), or move fund transfers to the end of the function. |
| **BC7** | What is a fallback function and when is it invoked? | Solidity syntax. | Function without a name executed when a contract receives plain ether or when no other function matches the calldata. In Solidity ≥0.6 it’s split into `receive()` (plain ether) and `fallback()` (non‑matching calldata). |
| **BC8** | Explain the concept of delegatecall and a scenario where it is useful. | Advanced Solidity. | `delegatecall` runs code from another contract **in the caller’s context**, preserving storage, `msg.sender`, and `msg.value`. Used for **proxy / upgradable contracts** (EIP‑1967). |
| **BC9** | What are events and why are they important? | Logging. | Events are logs stored in the transaction receipt, cheap, indexed, and can be filtered off‑chain. Used to emit state changes (`Transfer` event) for UI and monitoring. |
| **BC10** | How do you prevent integer overflow/underflow in Solidity 0.8+? | Safety. | Solidity 0.8 introduced built‑in overflow checks that automatically revert on overflow/underflow. For older versions use OpenZeppelin’s `SafeMath`. |
| **BC11** | Write a minimal ERC‑20 token contract (≈15 lines). | Coding skill. | ```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract MyToken {
    string public name = "MyToken";
    string public symbol = "MTK";
    uint8  public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1e24; // 1 000 000 MTK
    mapping(address=>uint256) public balanceOf;
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    constructor() { balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply; }
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "insufficient");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
}
``` |
| **BC12** | What is EIP‑1559 and how does it affect gas pricing? | Recent upgrade. | Introduces a **base fee** (burned) that auto‑adjusts per block, plus an optional **tip** for miners. Users set `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. Improves fee predictability and reduces volatility. |
| **BC13** | Explain the concept of state channels and when you would use them. | Layer‑2 scaling. | Off‑chain bilateral channel where participants exchange signed messages updating balances. Only the final state is submitted on‑chain, drastically reducing on‑chain tx count and latency. Ideal for high‑frequency micro‑payments. |
| **BC14** | What is a Merkle proof and how is it used in cross‑chain verification? | Cross‑chain. | A proof contains sibling hashes needed to recompute the Merkle root from a leaf. A contract on Chain B can verify that a transaction existed on Chain A by checking the proof against the known root (posted by a relayer). |
| **BC15** | Define an HTLC (Hashed TimeLock Contract) and its role in atomic swaps. | Cross‑chain payments. | HTLC locks funds with a hash lock (`hash = keccak256(preimage)`) and a timeout. Counter‑party can claim funds by revealing the preimage before timeout, guaranteeing atomicity across chains. |
| **BC16** | What are oracles and how would you secure them? | External data. | Oracles bring off‑chain data on‑chain. Secure by using **decentralized aggregation** (e.g., Chainlink), signed data feeds, and multiple sources with fallback. |
| **BC17** | Explain the difference between public, private, and permissioned blockchains. | Landscape. | **Public** – anyone can read/write (e.g., Ethereum). **Private** – single organization controls network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric). **Permissioned** – consortium of known participants with controlled access (e.g., Quorum). |
| **BC18** | What is finality and how does it differ in PoW vs. BFT consensus? | Consensus. | Finality = point after which a block cannot be reverted. PoW gives **probabilistic** finality (more confirmations → higher confidence). BFT (e.g., Tendermint) provides **deterministic** finality after a known number of votes. |
| **BC19** | How would you implement a cross‑chain payment from Ethereum to a Substrate‑based chain? | System design. | 1️⃣ Lock funds on Ethereum with an HTLC contract. 2️⃣ Generate a secret & hash, send hash to Substrate. 3️⃣ On Substrate, create matching HTLC that can be redeemed with the secret. 4️⃣ Reveal secret on Substrate → claim on Ethereum before timeout. Use a relayer to monitor events. |
| **BC20** | What is the purpose of the EVM and can you run it outside of Ethereum? | Platform. | The EVM executes bytecode (compiled from Solidity) in a sandbox. It can be embedded elsewhere (e.g., Hyperledger Burrow, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche C‑Chain) because it’s a language‑agnostic virtual machine spec. |

## 5️⃣ Rust – Systems Programming  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **R1** | Explain Rust’s ownership model in three bullet points. | Memory safety. | 1️⃣ Each value has a single owner. 2️⃣ When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. 3️⃣ Ownership can be transferred (`move`) or borrowed (`&` immutable, `&mut` mutable) with compile‑time checks. |
| **R2** | What is the borrow checker and why is it important? | Safety guarantee. | Enforces borrowing rules at compile time, preventing data races and dangling references. |
| **R3** | Differentiate between `Arc<T>` and `Rc<T>`. When would you use each? | Concurrency. | `Rc<T>` = single‑threaded reference counting. `Arc<T>` = atomic reference counting, safe across threads. Use `Arc` for shared data among async tasks or threads; `Rc` for single‑threaded contexts. |
| **R4** | What is a trait and how does it compare to Go interfaces? | Abstraction. | Trait defines required methods (behaviour) and can provide default implementations. Like Go interfaces but can also contain associated types and constants. |
| **R5** | Explain the `async`/`await` model in Rust and its runtime requirements. | Async programming. | `async fn` returns a **future** that does nothing until polled. An executor (Tokio, async‑std) drives the future to completion. Unlike Go, async in Rust is zero‑cost – no hidden goroutine; you must spawn tasks onto the executor. |
| **R6** | Write a simple `tokio` TCP echo server. | Practical coding. | ```rust
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await?;
    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0u8; 1024];
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
                    Ok(0) => break,
                    Ok(n) => n,
                    Err(_) => break,
                };
                if socket.write_all(&buf[..n]).await.is_err() { break; }
            }
        });
    }
}
``` |
| **R7** | What is the purpose of `unsafe` in Rust? When is it acceptable? | Safety discipline. | `unsafe` disables some borrow‑checker guarantees, allowing raw pointer dereferencing, FFI, and mutable statics. Acceptable when you can manually guarantee memory safety (e.g., calling C libraries, implementing low‑level data structures). |
| **R8** | Explain how you would expose a Rust library to Go via cgo. | Interop. | Compile Rust as a C‑compatible static/dynamic lib (`#[no_mangle] extern "C"` functions). In Go, use `import "C"` and call the exported functions. Marshal data between Go and C (e.g., convert `C.char*` to `string`). |
| **R9** | What are zero‑cost abstractions? Give an example. | Performance philosophy. | Abstractions that compile away without runtime overhead. Example: `for x in vec.iter()` compiles to a simple pointer loop, same speed as hand‑written code. |
| **R10** | How does Rust’s `Result<T,E>` differ from Go’s `error` handling? | Error handling style. | `Result` is a type that **must** be handled (`match` or `?`). The compiler forces you to consider the error case. Go’s `error` is a convention; you can ignore it. |
| **R11** | What is a lifetime annotation and why is it needed? | Borrow checking. | Tells the compiler how long a reference is valid relative to other references. Needed when the compiler cannot infer the relationship (e.g., returning a reference derived from an argument). |
| **R12** | Give an example of a lock‑free data structure you could implement in Rust. | Advanced concurrency. | A **MPSC queue** using atomic `head`/`tail` pointers (`crossbeam::queue::SegQueue`). Rust’s ownership model makes lock‑free code safer because raw pointers are wrapped in `AtomicPtr`. |
| **R13** | What is Cargo and what are its primary commands? | Tooling. | Cargo is Rust’s build system & package manager. Primary commands: `cargo new`, `cargo build`, `cargo run`, `cargo test`, `cargo bench`, `cargo publish`. |
| **R14** | Explain the difference between `Box<T>` and `&T`. | Memory allocation. | `Box<T>` owns heap‑allocated data; the box itself lives on the stack. `&T` is a borrowed reference; it does **not** own the data. |
| **R15** | How would you profile a Rust service for CPU hotspots? | Performance analysis. | Use `cargo flamegraph` (via `perf`) or `perf record` + `perf report`. For async, `tokio-console` shows task latency. |
| **R16** | What are **features** in `Cargo.toml` and why are they useful? | Conditional compilation. | Features are optional compile‑time flags that enable/dis‑enable dependencies or code via `#[cfg(feature = "foo")]`. They let you build a binary with only needed components (e.g., optional `serde`). |
| **R17** | Describe the process of generating a Go client from a protobuf definition. | RPC. | `protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. service.proto` generates Go structs and gRPC server/client stubs. Use `grpc-go` for high‑performance RPC between micro‑services. |
| **R18** | What is the difference between `HashMap` and `BTreeMap`? When would you pick each? | Data structures. | `HashMap` → O(1) average lookup, unsorted. `BTreeMap` → O(log n) lookup, maintains order; useful for range queries (e.g., price‑ordered order book). |
| **R19** | How does Rust handle panic vs. unwinding? | Error model. | By default, `panic = "abort"` for binaries (process exits). `panic = "unwind"` enables stack unwinding (useful for libraries). In `no_std` environments you usually abort to avoid runtime overhead. |
| **R20** | Explain how you would safely share a mutable configuration object across async tasks. | Concurrency pattern. | Wrap config in `Arc<RwLock<Config>>`. Readers acquire `read().await` (or `read()` sync), writers acquire `write()`. In Tokio, use `tokio::sync::RwLock`. |

## 6️⃣ Cross‑Chain & Interoperability  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **X1** | What is an atomic swap and what cryptographic primitive makes it possible? | Cross‑chain fundamentals. | Atomic swap lets two parties exchange assets on different chains without a trusted third party. It uses **hash‑time‑locked contracts (HTLC)** – the hash preimage acts as a secret that both sides must reveal. |
| **X2** | Compare “trusted bridges” vs. “trustless bridges”. | Security awareness. | Trusted bridges rely on a set of custodial validators (e.g., Binance Bridge). Trustless bridges use decentralized verification (e.g., proof‑of‑relay, threshold signatures). Trustless is more secure but more complex. |
| **X3** | Explain the Inter‑Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and a scenario where you’d use it. | Modern cross‑chain tech. | IBC (Cosmos) defines a packet‑relay model: a source chain sends a packet, a relayer forwards it to the destination chain. Used to transfer tokens or send cross‑chain messages (e.g., governance proposals). |
| **X4** | What is a Merkle‑Patricia Trie and where is it used? | Data structure. | A trie where each node is stored as a Merkle hash; used by Ethereum to store the world state (accounts, storage). Enables efficient proofs of inclusion. |
| **X5** | How would you design a cross‑chain oracle that supplies price data to both Ethereum and a Substrate chain? | System integration. | 1️⃣ Off‑chain aggregator fetches price from multiple sources. 2️⃣ Signs the data with a threshold multi‑sig key. 3️⃣ Publishes the signed payload on both chains via separate contracts/modules. 4️⃣ Each chain verifies the signature set before accepting the price. |
| **X6** | What is “chain re‑org” and what are the implications for on‑chain contracts? | Consensus. | Re‑org = reorganization of blocks (fork) that discards recent blocks. Contracts must be written to tolerate reverts (e.g., avoid relying on `block.number` for critical logic). Use finality guarantees or wait for enough confirmations. |
| **X7** | Explain the concept of “state roots” in a blockchain. | Consensus. | The root hash of the state trie (or Merkle‑Patricia Trie) included in each block header. Allows light clients to verify state transitions by checking Merkle proofs against the root. |
| **X8** | How can you verify an EVM transaction on another chain that does not run the EVM? | Cross‑chain verification. | Use a **Merkle proof** of the transaction receipt (including logs) against the block’s state root, then verify the proof on the other chain (via a verifier contract). |
| **X9** | What are “threshold signatures” and why are they useful for cross‑chain bridges? | Cryptography. | Scheme where a private key is split among *n* participants; any *t* can produce a valid signature. Useful to decentralize bridge validator sets while preventing a single point of compromise. |
| **X10** | Describe a “relayer” in the context of IBC. | Architecture. | Off‑chain process that watches events on the source chain, packages them into IBC packets, and submits them to the destination chain. Must be reliable; often run by multiple operators for redundancy. |
| **X11** | How would you handle “double‑spend” attempts across two chains? | Security. | Use HTLC with timeouts; both sides lock funds before the secret is revealed. If one side tries to double‑spend, the timeout forces a revert on the other chain. |
| **X12** | What is a “cross‑chain atomic transaction” and how does it differ from a regular multi‑step transaction? | Conceptual. | Atomic transaction guarantees **all‑or‑nothing** across chains; a regular multi‑step transaction may be partially completed if a failure occurs on one chain. |
| **X13** | Explain “optimistic rollups” vs. “zk‑rollups”. Which is more suitable for cross‑chain asset transfers? | Layer‑2. | Optimistic rollups assume transactions are valid and allow challenges; zk‑rollups provide validity proofs on‑chain. For cross‑chain transfers, **zk‑rollups** give stronger fraud‑proof guarantees, though they are more complex. |
| **X14** | What is the purpose of “validator slashing” in proof‑of‑stake networks? | Incentive design. | Penalises misbehaving validators (double signing, downtime) by destroying a portion of their stake, aligning incentives to act honestly. |
| **X15** | Give an example of a cross‑chain dApp you could build using the skills in this role. | Creative thinking. | A decentralized exchange that matches orders on a single order‑book service (Go) and settles on multiple chains (Ethereum, BSC) via HTLC bridges, exposing a unified UI. |

## 7️⃣ Security & Best Practices  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **S1** | What are the top three OWASP risks for blockchain‑related web APIs? | Security awareness. | 1️⃣ Injection (SQL/NoSQL). 2️⃣ Broken authentication / insecure key handling. 3️⃣ Insufficient logging & monitoring (hard to detect fraud). |
| **S2** | How would you protect private keys in a Go service? | Credential handling. | Store encrypted in a KMS (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault). Load into memory only when needed, zero‑out after use. Never log or serialize. Use HSM for signing when possible. |
| **S3** | Explain the concept of “front‑running” and a mitigation strategy. | Blockchain‑specific attack. | Front‑running = observing a pending transaction and submitting a higher‑fee transaction to be executed first. Mitigate with commit‑reveal schemes, batching orders, or on‑chain deterministic ordering. |
| **S4** | What is a “replay attack” in the context of cross‑chain transactions? | Security. | Attacker re‑submits a previously signed transaction on another chain. Prevent by including a chain‑specific domain separator or nonce in the signed payload. |
| **S5** | How do you ensure “immutability” of audit logs? | Auditing. | Write logs to an append‑only store (e.g., S3 with Object‑Lock, immutable DB tables). Use cryptographic hash chaining: each entry stores `hash(prev_entry)`. |
| **S6** | What is the purpose of rate limiting on a blockchain node’s RPC endpoint? | DoS mitigation. | Prevents abusive clients from overwhelming the node, protecting bandwidth and CPU. Implement token‑bucket per IP or API‑key. |
| **S7** | Describe how you would perform a static analysis of Solidity contracts. | Tooling. | Use tools like **Slither**, **MythX**, or **Oyente** to detect re‑entrancy, uninitialized storage pointers, integer overflows before deployment. |
| **S8** | What is a “dead man’s switch” in smart contracts? | Safety. | Mechanism that automatically disables or transfers ownership if the owner does not perform a periodic “heartbeat” transaction. Useful for recovery if the key is lost. |
| **S9** | Explain the concept of a “gas stipend” and its implications for token transfer callbacks. | EVM nuance. | When a contract sends Ether via `transfer` or `send`, the callee receives only **2300 gas** – enough for logging but not for complex logic, preventing re‑entrancy. |
| **S10** | How would you secure inter‑service communication in a micro‑service architecture? | Ops. | Use **mutual TLS (mTLS)** for authentication, sign JWT tokens, enforce RBAC, encrypt data at rest, rotate keys regularly. |
| **S11** | What is the difference between “whitelist” and “blacklist” validation? When is each appropriate? | Input validation. | Whitelist = accept only known‑good patterns (e.g., regex for address). Blacklist = reject known‑bad patterns. Whitelist is safer for public APIs; blacklist can be used for internal sanitisation. |
| **S12** | How would you protect against SQL injection in Go? | Secure coding. | Use **prepared statements** (`db.ExecContext(ctx, "INSERT … VALUES (?, ?)", v1, v2)`) or an ORM that auto‑escapes. Never concatenate user input into query strings. |
| **S13** | What is “address‑reuse” and why is it a risk? | Crypto hygiene. | Re‑using the same private key across multiple chains or services increases exposure; a single compromise leaks all assets. Use separate keys per purpose. |
| **S14** | Explain “confidential transactions” and a scenario where they are useful. | Privacy. | Transactions where amounts are hidden using Pedersen commitments (e.g., Monero, MimbleWimble). Useful for private exchanges where order size should not be public. |
| **S15** | What is the “principle of least privilege” and how does it apply to a blockchain node operator? | Access control. | Give each user/process only the permissions required. Node operator should have read‑only access to blockchain data, not admin rights on the host unless needed. |

## 8️⃣ DevOps & Tooling  

| # | Question | What they test | Concise answer |
|---|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **O1** | How do you containerize a Go micro‑service? | Deployment. | Multi‑stage Dockerfile: `FROM golang:1.22 AS builder` → build static binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux`). Then `FROM scratch` (or `alpine`) and `COPY --from=builder /app/app .`. Result < 15 MB. |
| **O2** | What is the purpose of a `Makefile` in a Go project? | Build automation. | Provides shortcuts for common tasks (`make test`, `make lint`, `make build`). Keeps CI scripts simple and reproducible. |
| **O3** | Explain the difference between `docker run` and `docker compose up`. | Orchestration. | `docker run` starts a single container. `docker compose` defines multi‑container services (API, MySQL, Redis), handles networking, volumes, and start‑order. |
| **O4** | How would you set up continuous integration for a Go + Solidity repo? | CI/CD. | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI steps: 1️⃣ `go test -v ./...` 2️⃣ `golangci-lint` 3️⃣ Compile contracts with `solc` (or Foundry) 4️⃣ Run contract tests (`forge test` / `truffle test`) 5️⃣ Build Docker image, push to registry. |
| **O5** | What is “blue‑green deployment” and why might it be relevant for a trading platform? | Release strategy. | Deploy a new version alongside the old one, switch traffic via load‑balancer, monitor, then decommission the old version. Guarantees zero‑downtime, essential for 24/7 trading. |
| **O6** | Explain the role of Prometheus & Grafana in monitoring a high‑frequency trading system. | Observability. | Prometheus scrapes metrics (`/metrics`) from Go services (histograms, counters). Grafana visualises latency percentiles, error rates, queue lengths; alerts fire before SLAs are breached. |
| **O7** | How do you securely store secrets (DB passwords, API keys) for Go services running in Kubernetes? | Secrets management. | Use Kubernetes Secrets (encrypted at rest) or external vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Pull secrets at container start via init‑container or side‑car, avoid hard‑coding. |
| **O8** | What is “chaos engineering” and a simple experiment you could run on a trading engine? | Reliability. | Intentionally inject failures (kill a matching‑engine pod, add latency to Redis, drop network packets) to verify the system degrades gracefully and recovers. |
| **O9** | Describe the process of generating a Go client from a protobuf definition. | RPC. | `protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. service.proto` generates Go structs and gRPC server/client stubs. Use `grpc-go` for high‑performance RPC between micro‑services. |
| **O10** | What is a “service mesh” (e.g., Istio) and what benefits does it bring to a micro‑service trading platform? | Networking. | Provides transparent mTLS, traffic routing, retries, circuit‑breaking, and observability without code changes. Helpful for per‑service security & resiliency. |
