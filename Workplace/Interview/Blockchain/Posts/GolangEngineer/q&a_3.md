**I. Foundational Computer Science & Data Structures (15 Questions)**

1. **Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.** A stack is LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), while a queue is FIFO (First-In, First-Out).
2. **What is a hash table, and how does it work?** A hash table uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, providing efficient lookup.
3. **Describe different types of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort). What are their time complexities?** Bubble Sort (O(n^2)), Merge Sort (O(n log n)), Quick Sort (O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst).
4. **What is the difference between a linked list and an array?** Linked lists dynamically allocate memory, while arrays have a fixed size. Linked lists offer efficient insertions/deletions, arrays offer faster access.

7. **What is the difference between a binary search tree and a balanced binary search tree?** Balanced BSTs (e.g., AVL, Red-Black) maintain a logarithmic height, preventing worst-case O(n) searches.
8. **What are graphs, and how are they represented (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)?** Graphs represent relationships between entities. Adjacency matrix uses a 2D array, adjacency list uses linked lists.

32. **How do you use Go's built-in testing framework?** Use the `testing` package and write test functions.
33. **Explain the concept of reflection in Go.** Reflection allows you to inspect and manipulate types at runtime.
34. **How do you handle timeouts in Go?** Use the `time` package and `time.After`.
35. **What are the best practices for writing concurrent Go code?** Keep goroutines small, avoid shared mutable state, and use channels for communication.

36. **What are the core components of a blockchain?** Blocks, transactions, hash functions, consensus mechanisms, and a distributed network.
37. **Explain the difference between public, private, and consortium blockchains.** Public: open to anyone. Private: permissioned, controlled by a single organization. Consortium: permissioned, controlled by multiple organizations.
38. **What are the different consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS, PBFT)?** PoW: Proof of Work, PoS: Proof of Stake, DPoS: Delegated Proof of Stake, PBFT: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
39. **How does a Merkle tree work, and why is it used in blockchain?** Merkle trees efficiently verify data integrity.
