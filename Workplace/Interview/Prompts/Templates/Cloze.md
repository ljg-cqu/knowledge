Framework for generating high-quality fill-in-the-blank assessments with proper structure, citations, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

---

# Part I: Specifications

Define quality requirements, standards, and constraints.

## Specifications

### Scope and Structure

- **Scope**: 24–40 items for senior/expert level
- **Format**: Unambiguous blanks (___); array of acceptable answers
- **Difficulty Distribution**: Maintain 20/40/40 balance (Foundational/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Normalization**: Case-insensitive, trim whitespace, strip punctuation; specify numeric tolerances
- **Grading**: Acceptance lists with tolerances; document borderline answers, partial credit
- **Conflict Handling**: For contested terminology, acceptance lists include valid variants from different schools/regions

### Citation Standards

- **Languages**: ~60% EN, ~30% ZH, ~10% other (tag each: [EN], [ZH], etc.)
- **Source Types**: (1) Official docs (language specs, vendor docs, RFCs); (2) Standards/peer-reviewed (ISO, IEEE, academic journals, conference papers); (3) Audits/reports (security audits, industry analyses, regulatory guidance); (4) Vetted code (production repos with stable releases)
- **Format**: APA 7th with language tags
- **Distribution**: Codebase/libraries (repos, maturity, benchmarks); Literature/Reports
- **Inline Citation**: Use [Ref: ID] in rationales when referencing factual claims, definitions, and technical specifications. Narrative/connective sentences may remain uncited.

### Reference Minimum Requirements

| Reference Section | Floor Count | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glossary, Terminology & Acronyms | ≥10 entries | Core concepts, domain-specific jargon, localized terminology |
| Codebase & Library References | ≥5 entries | Primary stack components, SDKs, supporting tooling |
| Authoritative Literature & Reports | ≥6 entries | Standards, peer-reviewed work, regulatory/industry analyses |
| APA Style Source Citations | ≥12 total | Language mix (~60% EN / ~30% ZH / ~10% other) |

> **Exception handling:** If a section cannot meet the floor count, explicitly state the shortfall, provide rationale, and outline a plan to source additional materials.

### Quality Gates

- Recency: ≥50% of citations from the last 3 years; for fast-moving domains (AI, security), target ≥70% from the last 2 years.
- Source diversity: Include at least 3 source types (official docs, standards/peer-reviewed, audits/reports); no single source >25% of total citations.
- Evidence coverage: ≥70% of items include ≥1 inline citation in rationale; ≥30% include ≥2 citations tied to distinct claims.
- Codebase maturity: Each codebase/library entry includes license, last commit ≤12 months, latest stable release, and security audit status (if available).
- Deduplication: Canonicalize and avoid duplicate entries; prefer persistent links (DOIs, standards bodies, archived URLs).
- Link validity: Validate that links resolve (or provide archived link) at time of delivery.
- Cross-reference binding: Use reference IDs and link item rationales to specific items in the Reference Sections.

> Scaling guidance: For sets >50 items or regulated domains, increase floor counts by ~1.5× (round up) instead of unlimited growth. Prioritize meeting the Quality Gates first.

### Pre-Submission Validation

Execute ALL steps below. Present results in a validation report table. Fix any failures and re-run validation until all checks pass.

**Step 1 – Count Audit**
- Count: Glossary entries, Codebase entries, Literature entries, APA citations, Items (total + by difficulty level)
- Report: `Glossary: X (target ≥10) | Codebase: Y (≥5) | Literature: Z (≥6) | APA: W (≥12) | Items: N total (F foundational, I intermediate, A advanced)`
- Pass if: All counts meet minimums AND difficulty ratio ≈20/40/40

**Step 2 – Citation Coverage Scan**
- For EACH item rationale: Count inline `[Ref: ...]` occurrences
- Report: `X of Y items have ≥1 citation (Z%); W of Y have ≥2 citations (V%)`
- Pass if: ≥70% have ≥1 citation AND ≥30% have ≥2 citations

**Step 3 – Language Distribution Check**
- Count citations with `[EN]`, `[ZH]`, and other language tags
- Report: `EN: X (Y%) | ZH: A (B%) | Other: C (D%)`
- Pass if: EN ≈50-70%, ZH ≈20-40%, Other ≈5-15%

**Step 4 – Recency Verification**
- Extract publication year from EACH citation
- Report: `X of Y citations (Z%) from 2022-2025 (last 3 years)`
- Pass if: ≥50% from last 3 years (≥70% for AI/security domains)

**Step 5 – Source Type Diversity**
- Classify EACH citation: (1) Official docs, (2) Standards/peer-reviewed, (3) Audits/reports, (4) Vetted code
- Report: `Type 1: X | Type 2: Y | Type 3: Z | Type 4: W | Types present: N | Max single source: M citations (P%)`
- Pass if: ≥3 types present AND no single source >25%

**Step 6 – Link Validation**
- Test EACH URL or verify archived link exists
- Report: `Tested X links: Y accessible, Z broken` (list broken URLs)
- Pass if: All links accessible OR archived alternatives provided

**Step 7 – Cross-Reference Integrity**
- For EACH `[Ref: ID]` in rationales: Verify ID exists in Reference Sections (G#→Glossary, C#→Codebase, L#→Literature, A#→APA)
- Report: `Found X inline refs; Y resolve correctly, Z broken` (list broken refs)
- Pass if: All refs resolve (Z=0)

**Step 8 – Answer Completeness**
- For EACH item: Verify acceptable answers list is non-empty and unambiguous
- Report: `X of Y items have complete answer lists; Z incomplete` (list issues)
- Pass if: All items have complete answers (Z=0)

**Step 9 – Blank Unambiguity**
- Review EACH statement for blank placement clarity
- Report: `X of Y items have unambiguous blanks; Z ambiguous` (list issues)
- Pass if: All blanks unambiguous (Z=0)

**Step 10 – Normalization Rules**
- For EACH item: Verify normalization rules (case, whitespace, punctuation, numeric tolerances) specified
- Report: `X of Y items have normalization rules; Z missing` (list issues)
- Pass if: All items have rules (Z=0)

**Step 11 – Conflict Handling Compliance**
- Identify items with contested terminology (terms with multiple valid variants across schools/regions)
- For EACH: Verify acceptance lists include ≥2 valid variants
- Report: `X applicable items; Y comply (Z%)`
- Pass if: ≥80% comply OR rationale provided

**Validation Report Template:**
```
| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Floors | G:X C:Y L:Z A:W I:N (F/I/A) | PASS/FAIL |
| Citation coverage | X% ≥1, Y% ≥2 | PASS/FAIL |
| Language dist | EN:X% ZH:Y% Other:Z% | PASS/FAIL |
| Recency | X% last 3yr | PASS/FAIL |
| Source diversity | N types, max P% | PASS/FAIL |
| Links | Y/X accessible | PASS/FAIL |
| Cross-refs | Y/X resolved | PASS/FAIL |
| Answer lists | Y/X complete | PASS/FAIL |
| Blank clarity | Y/X unambiguous | PASS/FAIL |
| Normalization | Y/X specified | PASS/FAIL |
```

> **MANDATORY:** If ANY check shows FAIL, stop, fix issues, regenerate affected sections, and re-run full validation. Only proceed to submission when ALL checks show PASS.

### Step 2: Reference Collection
1. Gather ≥10 glossary terms, ≥5 codebase/libraries, ≥6 literature sources, ≥12 APA citations
2. For EACH source: Tag language ([EN], [ZH], etc.), note publication year, classify source type (1-4)
3. Assign Reference IDs: G1-Gn (Glossary), C1-Cn (Codebase), L1-Ln (Literature), A1-An (APA)
4. **Inline Check**: Count sources (≥10/5/6/12?), language split (≈60/30/10?), recency (≥50% last 3yr?), diversity (≥3 types?) before proceeding

### Step 3: Item Generation
1. For EACH item: Write statement with unambiguous blank, assign difficulty
2. In EACH rationale: Include ≥1 inline `[Ref: ID]` after factual claims, definitions, technical specifications
3. For EACH item: Define acceptable answers array and normalization rules
4. **Inline Check**: After every 6 items, verify: blanks unambiguous, ≥1 citation per rationale, complete answer lists, normalization rules specified

### Step 4: Grading Framework
1. For EACH item: Document common incorrect answers and borderline cases
2. Specify tolerances and partial credit rules
3. **Inline Check**: All items have grading guidance? Normalization rules comprehensive?

### Step 5: Reference Section Compilation
1. Populate Glossary, Codebase, Literature, APA sections with collected sources
2. Include all required information (must-include fields per format)
3. Ensure Reference IDs match inline citations
4. **Inline Check**: Every [Ref: ID] in rationales resolves to an entry? All sources have required fields?

### Step 6: Pre-Submission Validation
