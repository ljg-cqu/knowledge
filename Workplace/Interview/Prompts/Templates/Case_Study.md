## APA Style Source Citations

- **References:** List all sources cited in the answers, grouped by source language with the targeted distribution (~60% English, ~30% Chinese, ~10% other languages). If credible non-English sources are not available, document the gap and default to high-quality English sources.
- **Format:** Follow APA 7th edition (author, year, title, source, DOI/URL when available) and include language tags (e.g., `[EN]`, `[ZH]`, `[JP]`).
- **Verification:** Ensure each reference is credible, jurisdiction-appropriate, and directly supports the content; highlight regulatory or legal sources when applicable.
