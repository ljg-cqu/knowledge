## Glossary, Terminology & Acronyms

[Key programming terms, algorithms, data structures with language tags]

---

## Codebase & Library References

- [Aggregate repositories, SDKs, audits, or tooling suites cited across the deep-dive bank. Include stack, modules, maturity, licensing, integration hooks, performance/security benchmarks, distributed consistency guarantees, reliability/HA posture, and language support.]

---

## Authoritative Literature & Reports

- [Summarize standards, white/yellow papers, peer-reviewed literature, regulatory reports, and other vetted references referenced across question clusters, with notes on core findings, credibility, and language/jurisdiction.]

---

## APA Style Source Citations

- **References:** List all sources cited in the answers, grouped by source language with the targeted distribution (~60% English, ~30% Chinese, ~10% other languages). If credible non-English sources are not available, document the gap and default to high-quality English sources.
- **Format:** Follow APA 7th edition (author, year, title, source, DOI/URL when available) and include language tags (e.g., `[EN]`, `[ZH]`, `[JP]`).
- **Verification:** Ensure each reference is credible, jurisdiction-appropriate, and directly supports the content; highlight regulatory or legal sources when applicable.
