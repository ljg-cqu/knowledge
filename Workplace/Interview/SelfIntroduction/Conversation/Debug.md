Correct statement: "Tech Stack: Rust, Solana, AWS Bedrock Claude, Node.js, Kafka, IPFS".

1. Q: Jigao's GitHub username for the uniIOTX project is Trisome-Bedrock. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The GitHub username is incorrect. The resume states his username for uniIOTX was "Zealy-Rockx", while "Trisome-Bedrock" was used for the uniBTC project. This error would make it impossible to verify his contributions to the correct project. Correct statement: "GitHub username: Zealy-Rockx for uniIOTX, Trisome-Bedrock for uniBTC".

1. Q: The LABS platform was built on Ethereum Layer 2, achieving low gas fees through rollup technology. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The blockchain platform is incorrect. LABS was "based on Polkadot / Substrate" and achieved "zero Gas fee transactions" through Substrate's EVM compatibility, not Ethereum L2 or rollups. This fundamentally misrepresents the technical architecture choice. Correct statement: "Built on Substrate (Polkadot ecosystem), achieved zero Gas fee transactions".

1. Q: Jigao earned his Master's degree from Chongqing University in Computer Science in 2015. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The major is incorrect. His Master's degree was in "Mechanics", not Computer Science. While he later transitioned to software development, misrepresenting his academic background is factually wrong and affects evaluation of his formal CS training. Correct statement: "Master's Degree in Mechanics from Chongqing University (2012.09-2015.06)".

1. Q: The WillCity project used a centralized database approach to solve transaction ordering issues on Ethereum. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The solution approach is misrepresented. The resume indicates he "Developed several key components: nonce tracker, client wrapper, gRPC communication layer" and "Solved Ethereum transaction consistency issues". The solution involved proper nonce management and transaction tracking, not centralizing data off-chain. Correct statement: "Developed nonce tracker and gRPC components to solve Ethereum transaction consistency issues".

1. Q: At Exsonol Technology, Jigao managed a Filecoin cluster of approximately 200 nodes. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The cluster size is significantly understated. The resume specifies "Optimized 800-node Filecoin / Lotus storage cluster". Stating 200 nodes instead of 800 understates the scale of infrastructure management by 75%. Correct statement: "Optimized 800-node Filecoin / Lotus storage cluster".

1. Q: For the uniETH project, Jigao was responsible for writing the initial smart contracts and deploying them to mainnet. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The role is overstated. His actual contribution was "Designed uniETH cross-chain transaction system, reviewed contract security" and "Integrated EigenLayer Restaking functionality, optimized upgrade adaptations". He focused on cross-chain architecture and integration, not writing the initial contracts. Correct statement: "Designed cross-chain transaction system and integrated EigenLayer Restaking functionality".

1. Q: Jigao has extensive experience with Hardhat and Truffle testing frameworks for smart contract development. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The testing frameworks are incorrect. The resume explicitly mentions "Proficient with Foundry, Brownie testing frameworks", not Hardhat or Truffle.

1. Q: The uniBTC protocol achieved top ranking among BTC restaking protocols with over $10 million TVL. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The TVL amount is inflated. The resume states "TVL reached $4 million, ranking in the top three of similar protocols". Claiming $10 million instead of $4 million is a 150% inflation, and "top ranking" vs "top three" are different claims. Correct statement: "TVL reached $4 million, ranking in the top three of similar protocols".

1. Q: Before blockchain, Jigao worked as a software engineer at China Construction developing internal management systems. What is wrong and how to fix it?
   A: The role and work are mischaracterized.
