1. Q: If someone states that Jigao Luo has 5+ years of experience in the blockchain industry, what factual error is present and how should it be corrected?
   A: This statement understates his experience duration by two years. According to his resume, blockchain-related work commenced in August 2018, which establishes a timeline of 7+ years by 2025, not 5+. This discrepancy diminishes the representation of his professional seniority. The accurate statement should read: "7+ years of experience in the blockchain industry."

1. Q: What inaccuracies exist in the claim that the uniBTC project was deployed on 8+ blockchain networks with a TVL of $2 million?
   A: Both metrics are incorrect. The resume documents that uniBTC was deployed across 12+ blockchain networks with a TVL reaching $4 million. Specifically, the network deployment is understated by 33%, while the TVL is understated by 50%. These errors significantly misrepresent both the technical breadth and the financial scale of the project. The correct statement is: "Deployed on 12+ blockchain networks with TVL of $4 million."

1. Q: If an introduction claims that at Beijing 21Vianet, Jigao built a technical team of 8 members for the ABFPaaS real-time incentive system, what is incorrect about this description?
   A: The team size specification is inaccurate. The resume explicitly indicates that he built a 12-person technical team, not 8 members. This 33% understatement diminishes both his team management scope and the project scale. The accurate description should state: "Built and led a 12-person technical team."

1. Q: What is the factual error in stating that Jigao contributed to the Bedrock-DAO project by writing the core smart contracts from scratch?
   A: This statement fundamentally misrepresents his role. His actual contribution focused on security auditing rather than initial development. Specifically, he conducted code review and testing, submitted multiple bug fixes and optimization suggestions, and reviewed code to fix 20+ security vulnerabilities. He did not write the core contracts from scratch but specialized in auditing and security improvements. The correct statement is: "Reviewed code, fixed 20+ security vulnerabilities and performance issues."

1. Q: What inaccuracies are present in the claim that the Lido-on-Avalanche MPC system was successfully deployed to the Avalanche mainnet and is currently processing millions in TVL?
   A: The deployment environment is incorrect. The resume specifies that the system was deployed on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, not the mainnet. Additionally, there is no mention of TVL metrics for this project. Claiming mainnet deployment and TVL figures misrepresents the project's actual production status. The accurate statement should be: "System successfully deployed on Avalanche Fuji testnet, recognized by Lido official team."

1. Q: If someone describes that for the Filecoin optimization project, Jigao modified the PreCommit proof algorithm to parallel execution, improving performance by 50%, what errors exist in this description?
   A: Both the algorithm name and the performance metric are incorrect. The resume documents that he modified the WindowPoST proof algorithm to parallel execution, achieving a 33% performance improvement, not PreCommit with 50% improvement. This error misrepresents both the technical specifics and the achievement metrics. The correct statement is: "Modified WindowPoST proof algorithm to parallel execution, performance improved by 33%."

1. Q: What is factually incorrect about stating that Jigao worked at Chengdu Artest Technology from 2022.04 to 2025.10 as a Senior Backend Developer?
   A: The end date contains a one-year error. The resume shows his tenure as 2022.04 to 2024.10, not extending into 2025. This creates a timeline discrepancy that affects the understanding of his current availability and recent work history. The accurate statement is: "2022.04-2024.10."

1. Q: What fundamental errors exist in describing the AIW3 Backend project as being built using Python, Ethereum, and ChatGPT API for the AI agent system?
   A: The entire technology stack is misrepresented. The actual stack consisted of Rust, Solana, AWS Bedrock Claude, Node.js, Kafka, and IPFS. This error misidentifies the blockchain ecosystem (Ethereum versus Solana), the primary programming language (Python versus Rust), and the AI service provider (ChatGPT versus AWS Bedrock Claude). These are not minor variations but represent fundamentally different technology choices. The correct statement is: "Tech Stack: Rust, Solana, AWS Bedrock Claude, Node.js, Kafka, IPFS."

1. Q: What is incorrect about identifying Trisome-Bedrock as Jigao's GitHub username for the uniIOTX project?
   A: The GitHub username attribution is reversed between projects. The resume indicates that his username for uniIOTX was Zealy-Rockx, while Trisome-Bedrock was used for the uniBTC project. This error would prevent proper verification of his contributions to each respective project. The accurate statement is: "GitHub username: Zealy-Rockx for uniIOTX, Trisome-Bedrock for uniBTC."

1. Q: What technical inaccuracies exist in the claim that the LABS platform was built on Ethereum Layer 2, achieving low gas fees through rollup technology?
   A: The blockchain platform and mechanism are incorrect. LABS was based on Polkadot/Substrate and achieved zero gas fee transactions through Substrate's EVM compatibility, not through Ethereum Layer 2 or rollup technology. This fundamentally misrepresents the architectural foundation and the technical approach to transaction cost optimization. The correct statement is: "Built on Substrate (Polkadot ecosystem), achieved zero gas fee transactions."

1. Q: What is the factual error in stating that Jigao earned his Master's degree from Chongqing University in Computer Science in 2015?
   A: The academic major is incorrect. His Master's degree was in Mechanics, not Computer Science. While he subsequently transitioned to software development, misrepresenting his formal academic background is factually inaccurate and affects the evaluation of his formal computer science training. The correct statement is: "Master's Degree in Mechanics from Chongqing University (2012.09-2015.06)."

1. Q: What is misrepresented in the claim that the WillCity project used a centralized database approach to solve transaction ordering issues on Ethereum?
   A: The technical solution is mischaracterized. The resume indicates that he developed several key components including a nonce tracker, client wrapper, and gRPC communication layer to solve Ethereum transaction consistency issues. The solution involved proper nonce management and transaction tracking within the distributed system, not centralizing data off-chain. The correct statement is: "Developed nonce tracker and gRPC components to solve Ethereum transaction consistency issues."

1. Q: What numerical inaccuracy exists in stating that at Exsonol Technology, Jigao managed a Filecoin cluster of approximately 200 nodes?
   A: The cluster size is significantly understated by 75%. The resume specifies that he optimized an 800-node Filecoin/Lotus storage cluster. Stating 200 nodes instead of 800 substantially misrepresents the scale of infrastructure management involved. The correct statement is: "Optimized 800-node Filecoin / Lotus storage cluster."

1. Q: What is overstated in claiming that for the uniETH project, Jigao was responsible for writing the initial smart contracts and deploying them to mainnet?
   A: The role description overstates his direct contract development involvement. His actual contributions were designing the uniETH cross-chain transaction system, reviewing contract security, integrating EigenLayer Restaking functionality, and optimizing upgrade adaptations. He focused on system architecture and integration rather than writing the initial contract implementations. The correct statement is: "Designed cross-chain transaction system and integrated EigenLayer Restaking functionality."

1. Q: What is incorrect about claiming that Jigao has extensive experience with Hardhat and Truffle testing frameworks for smart contract development?
   A: The testing frameworks are misidentified. The resume explicitly mentions proficiency with Foundry and Brownie testing frameworks, not Hardhat or Truffle. While all are legitimate Ethereum development tools, this error misrepresents his actual toolchain experience and technical background. The correct statement is: "Proficient with Foundry, Brownie testing frameworks."

1. Q: What factual errors exist in stating that the uniBTC protocol achieved top ranking among BTC restaking protocols with over $10 million TVL?
   A: Both the ranking and the TVL figure are inflated. The resume states that TVL reached $4 million with a ranking in the top three of similar protocols. Claiming $10 million instead of $4 million represents a 150% inflation, while "top ranking" versus "top three" are materially different achievement levels. The correct statement is: "TVL reached $4 million, ranking in the top three of similar protocols."

1. Q: What is mischaracterized in the claim that before blockchain, Jigao worked as a software engineer at China Construction developing internal management systems?
   A: Both the role and the work nature are misrepresented. He worked as a Technical Department Engineer/Project Technical Lead responsible for construction organization design on physical construction projects, specifically the Chongqing T3 Terminal and Hengfeng Guiyang Center. This was civil engineering work, not software development. This error obscures his professional transition from civil engineering to blockchain technology. The correct statement is: "Worked as construction engineer responsible for construction organization design on major projects."

1. Q: What integration components are incorrectly stated in the claim that the ABFPaaS system integrated with WeChat enterprise platform, Ant Alliance Chain, and Oracle database?
   A: The integration components are partially incorrect. The resume documents integration with Ant Alliance Chain, e-signature platform, and enterprise ERP, with PostgreSQL as the database system, not WeChat or Oracle. This error misrepresents the actual system architecture and technology choices. The correct statement is: "Integrated Ant Alliance Chain, e-signature platform, and enterprise ERP with PostgreSQL database."

1. Q: What is incomplete about describing that Jigao developed the SwaGin framework as an open-source Gin extension supporting RESTful APIs?
   A: The description omits the specific functionality that constitutes the framework's primary value. The resume mentions Gin framework OpenAPI support specifically, not merely RESTful API capability. OpenAPI (Swagger) support represents a more specific and valuable feature than general RESTful API functionality. The correct statement is: "Developed Gin framework OpenAPI extensions (SwaGin)."

1. Q: What is too narrow about the claim that for the AIW3 project, Jigao provided recommendations comparing Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum for high TPS requirements?
   A: The scope of his technology evaluation is understated. The resume indicates that he provided technology selection recommendations across three categories: high TPS chains, DEX specialized chains, and RWA specialized chains. He evaluated broader blockchain categories beyond comparing specific Layer 2 solutions. The correct statement is: "Provided technology selection for high TPS chains, DEX specialized chains, and RWA specialized chains."
