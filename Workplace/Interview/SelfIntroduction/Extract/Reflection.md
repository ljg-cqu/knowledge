   A: Suggests public work creates verifiable credibility signals; indicates open source serves as both portfolio and learning mechanism; reflects that blockchain culture values transparency and code auditability; shows strategic use of visibility for career advancement.

1. Q: The MPC multi-party computation system (Project ⑤) addresses key splitting and multi-signature for asset security. How does designing cryptographic trust systems challenge assumptions about centralized versus distributed control?
   A: Questions single point of failure models in key management; suggests trust can be algorithmically distributed without human intermediaries; challenges assumption that security requires centralization; indicates cryptographic protocols can replace organizational hierarchies.

1. Q: The resume shows experience coordinating international teams (Singapore, US, Europe) and authoring English technical documents. What does this international dimension reveal about the geographic nature of blockchain development versus traditional software roles?
   A: Challenges the colocation assumption in software teams; suggests blockchain projects are inherently global due to decentralized ethos; indicates English proficiency is not optional for senior roles; reflects that talent pools and capital cross borders more fluidly.

1. Q: The integration of AI trading strategy management (AWS Bedrock Claude) into the AIW3 project represents blockchain-AI convergence. How does this combination shift your mental model of where blockchain value creation is heading?
   A: Questions whether blockchain remains a standalone domain; suggests AI agents may become primary users of decentralized systems; indicates smart contracts could serve as execution layer for AI decision-making; reflects convergence toward autonomous financial systems.

1. Q: The resume emphasizes solving non-functional challenges (nonce conflicts, transaction consistency, cross-chain communication) rather than just feature development. What does this focus reveal about the maturity curve of blockchain technology?
   A: Suggests the field is moving from "does it work" to "does it work reliably at scale"; indicates production systems require addressing edge cases and failure modes; reflects that user-facing features depend on solving distributed systems fundamentals; shows maturity requires systems engineering discipline.

1. Q: The technical breadth spans consensus algorithms, distributed storage (IPFS/Filecoin), DeFi protocols, and cryptographic primitives. How does this range challenge assumptions about specialization depth required for senior technical roles?
   A: Questions whether T-shaped skills (one deep specialty) suffice at senior levels; suggests blockchain architects need π-shaped skills (multiple deep areas); indicates cross-domain synthesis creates more value than single-domain mastery; reflects that system complexity demands polymath capabilities.

1. Q: The resume includes management experience (building 12-person team, cross-national coordination) alongside deep technical work. What does this combination suggest about the false dichotomy between technical and management career tracks?
   A: Challenges the assumption that technical depth and management breadth are mutually exclusive; suggests senior roles require both architectural vision and team coordination; indicates effective technical leadership depends on maintaining hands-on credibility; reflects that blockchain projects demand hybrid technical-organizational skills.

1. Q: The progression from optimizing existing systems (Filecoin cluster, Project ②) to designing new protocols (uniBTC, Project ⑨) shows an evolution from efficiency to innovation. How does this trajectory inform your understanding of skill development stages?
   A: Suggests mastery begins with understanding existing systems deeply; indicates optimization work builds intuition for design trade-offs; reflects that innovation requires first internalizing why current solutions exist; shows progression from "make it better" to "create something new" requires foundation in existing architectures.

1. Q: The resume demonstrates experience across both public blockchains (Ethereum, Solana) and consortium chains (Ant Alliance Chain). What does navigating these different trust models reveal about the assumptions underlying blockchain design philosophies?
   A: Questions the binary of "permissionless good, permissioned bad"; suggests different contexts require different trust assumptions; indicates understanding both models provides design flexibility; reflects that blockchain is a spectrum of decentralization trade-offs rather than ideological absolutes.

1. Q: The education background (Master's in Mechanics from Chongqing University, courses in numerical analysis and discrete mathematics) precedes blockchain specialization by years. How does this foundation challenge assumptions about the value of "non-directly-applicable" education?
   A: Suggests mathematical maturity transfers across domains; indicates computational thinking from physical modeling applies to blockchain algorithms; challenges the vocational training model favoring immediate applicability; reflects that abstract problem-solving skills compound over career spans.
