# Self Introduction - Job Interview
*Last Updated: 2025-11-24 | Status: Final | Owner: Jigao Luo (Zealy)*

## Introduction

### Purpose
Professional self-introduction for senior blockchain engineer/architect position interviews

### Scope
Covers professional background, technical expertise, leadership experience, and key achievements

### Target Audience
Hiring managers and technical interviewers for blockchain/Web3 senior positions

## Self Introduction Versions

### Version 1: Ultra-Brief (30-60 seconds)
**Use when**: Initial greeting, recruiter screening, or when asked to "briefly introduce yourself"

Good morning/afternoon. My name is Jigao Luo, professionally known as Zealy. I hold a master's degree from Chongqing University and began my career in construction engineering before transitioning to blockchain development in 2018. Over the past 7 years, I have worked across the full blockchain stack—from optimizing distributed storage clusters with hundreds of nodes, to developing DeFi protocols managing multi-million dollar TVL, and recently integrating AI with blockchain systems. I have held roles from blockchain developer to technical architect and team lead, working with companies across Singapore, the United States, and China. I am currently seeking senior technical positions where I can apply my experience in distributed systems, smart contract development, and technical leadership.

### Version 2: Standard (1-2 minutes)
**Use when**: Formal interview start, panel interviews, or when given time to "tell us about yourself"

Good morning/afternoon. My name is Jigao Luo—I am known as Zealy in the blockchain community. I am a senior blockchain engineer with 7+ years of specialized experience in distributed systems and DeFi protocols, working primarily with Golang, Solidity, and Rust.

My blockchain journey started in 2018 after completing my master's degree at Chongqing University. Since then, I have progressed from infrastructure work optimizing Filecoin storage clusters, to full-stack blockchain development on Polkadot and Ethereum, to leading smart contract development for production DeFi protocols.

My most significant recent work includes leading the development of uniBTC, a multi-chain BTC Restaking protocol that achieved $4 million TVL and deployment across 12+ networks, ranking among the top 3 similar protocols. I also developed the complete smart contract suite for uniIOTX liquid staking on IoTeX, and designed an MPC system for Lido-on-Avalanche that was recognized by their official team.

Beyond technical work, I established and led a 12-person engineering team at 21Vianet, and have extensive experience coordinating international teams across Singapore, the United States, and Europe. I am also an active open-source contributor—my work is on GitHub under usernames Zealy-Rockx and Trisome-Bedrock.

I am excited about opportunities to work on challenging distributed systems problems, contribute to secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure, and mentor engineering teams.

## Interview Tips for Myself

### Opening Strong
- Lead with current expertise: "7+ years in blockchain with focus on DeFi protocols and distributed systems"
- Mention most impressive metric: "$4 million TVL" or "12+ blockchain networks"
- Establish credibility: "Open source contributor with production code on GitHub"

### Handling Technical Questions
- Use STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Reference specific projects with metrics
- Demonstrate problem-solving process, not just solutions
- Be honest about challenges and what you learned

### Addressing Potential Concerns
- **Career Change from Construction**: "Foundation in complex system design and project management translated well to blockchain architecture"
- **Multiple Job Changes**: "Each move represented significant technical growth and increasing responsibility"
- **Recent Gap**: "Strategic consulting work and continued open-source contributions"

### Questions to Ask Interviewer
1. What are the biggest technical challenges the team is currently facing?
2. How does the team approach security audits and code reviews?
3. What does the multi-chain or cross-chain strategy look like?
4. How is the engineering team structured, and what would my role be in technical decision-making?
5. What opportunities exist for technical leadership and mentorship?

## Closing Statement

"I am excited about this opportunity because it aligns perfectly with my experience in building secure, scalable blockchain systems and my passion for solving complex distributed systems challenges. I believe my combination of hands-on technical expertise, proven track record in delivering high-stakes DeFi protocols, and experience leading international teams makes me well-suited for this senior position. I am eager to contribute to your team's success and continue growing in this rapidly evolving space."

## Next Steps

### Practice Delivery
- **Ultra-Brief Version**: Practice until smooth at 30-60 seconds
- **Standard Version**: Practice until smooth at 90-120 seconds  
- Record yourself and verify pacing—avoid rushing
- Practice transitions if interrupted or asked to elaborate

### Content Preparation
