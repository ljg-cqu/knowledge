Implemented using Aragon framework with Dune Analytics for transparency, it enables token holders to participate in protocol parameter adjustments, treasury management, and strategic decisions. During development, I identified and resolved over 20 security vulnerabilities and performance issues, ensuring the governance layer maintains the same security standards as the financial protocols it governs. The DAO manages protocol fees, staking parameters, and integration approvals for new blockchain networks, creating a community-driven development model.
   
   Q: What technical challenges did you address in the ETH and IOTX liquid staking implementations?
   A: Both implementations required solving distinct technical challenges. For uniETH, the primary challenge was integrating with multiple restaking platforms—EigenLayer and Symbiotic—while maintaining unified liquidity for derivative tokens. This required careful smart contract design to handle different validator selection mechanisms and reward distribution models. For uniIOTX on IoTeX, the challenge involved adapting liquid staking primitives to a less mature DeFi ecosystem with different staking mechanics. Both projects used Brownie for comprehensive Python-based testing and implemented extensive security measures including formal verification of critical functions and multi-signature controls for administrative operations.

The large language model's capabilities enable users to interact with sophisticated trading logic through conversational interfaces rather than requiring deep technical knowledge. Integration occurs through RESTful APIs, with Node.js services orchestrating requests between the Solana blockchain and the AI service.
   
   Q: Why was IPFS selected for storage rather than traditional databases?
   A: IPFS was selected for three strategic reasons. First, decentralization—storing trading strategy metadata and historical data on IPFS ensures no single point of failure and aligns with Web3 principles of data sovereignty. Second, immutability—content addressing guarantees that historical trading data cannot be retroactively modified, providing audit trails and transparency. Third, cost efficiency—IPFS reduces storage costs compared to on-chain storage while maintaining accessibility. Traditional databases remain in use for temporary operational data, but permanent records are committed to IPFS with content hashes recorded on-chain for verification.
