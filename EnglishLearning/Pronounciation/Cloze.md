## Item Bank

### Topic 1: Vowel Systems

#### Item 1: GOAT vowel in General American

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: In General American English, the GOAT vowel (as in "go", "home") is typically realized as a diphthong ___, moving from a mid-back position toward a high-back position.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/oʊ/", "oʊ"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore surrounding slashes / /)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Learner writes the correct IPA symbol `oʊ` with or without slashes ("/oʊ/" or "oʊ").
- Partial: Learner writes a clear description such as "a diphthong from mid-back to high-back" without the IPA symbol.
- Incorrect: Monophthong only (e.g., "/oː/"), wrong diphthong (e.g., "/əʊ/"), or unrelated vowel.
- Borderline: Spelling-based answers like "oa" or "o" that show orthographic knowledge but no phonetic awareness.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Many learners assume the GOAT vowel is a simple /o/; explicitly contrast diphthong vs monophthong [Ref: G1].
- Accent Variants: AmE typically uses /oʊ/; many BrE varieties use /əʊ/ [Ref: L1].
- Regional: Some regional AmE accents may show slight monophthongization; treat these as acceptable variants in listening, but keep /oʊ/ as the target for this item.
- Contested: Minor phonetic variation in starting point (closer to [ɔ] vs [o]) is not tested here [Ref: A1].
- Pedagogical: Use minimal pairs like "go" vs hypothetical *"gaw" and vowel charts to reinforce the diphthong trajectory.

**Rationale**: The GOAT vowel in General American is a mid-back closing diphthong /oʊ/, which distinguishes it from more monophthongal realizations in some British varieties and from other back vowels in the system [Ref: G1] [Ref: L1] [Ref: A1].

---

#### Item 2: BATH vowel in Received Pronunciation

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: In Received Pronunciation (RP), words like "bath", "grass", and "dance" typically use the long open back vowel ___, contrasting with /æ/ in General American.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/ɑː/", "ɑː"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore surrounding slashes / /)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Correct IPA symbol "ɑː" with or without slashes.
- Partial: Writes a description like "a long open back vowel" without the symbol.
- Incorrect: Writes "/æ/", "/ɒ/", or other non-target vowels.
- Borderline: Writes only "long a" or "ah"; teacher may award partial credit if explanation is added.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Learners often overgeneralize /æ/ from AmE to BrE; highlight lexical set differences [Ref: G2].
- Accent Variants: Northern English accents may not have the TRAP-BATH split and may use /æ/ instead of /ɑː/ [Ref: L2].
- Regional: This item targets Southern British RP/GB norms; mark that it does not apply to all British accents.
- Contested: Some ongoing sound change in younger speakers can affect quality but not the basic split [Ref: A2].
- Pedagogical: Use minimal pairs and regional maps (North vs South of England) to avoid treating RP as the only "correct" model.

**Rationale**: The TRAP-BATH split in Southern British English assigns the PALM vowel /ɑː/ to words like "bath" and "dance", in contrast with General American, which typically uses /æ/ for these items [Ref: G2] [Ref: L2] [Ref: A2].

### Topic 2: Consonants

#### Item 3: T-flapping in American English

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: In General American English, intervocalic /t/ in words like "water" and "better" is often realized as the alveolar flap ___ when the following syllable is unstressed.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["[ɾ]", "ɾ"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore brackets and slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes the correct IPA symbol `ɾ` with or without brackets.
- Partial: Writes a description like "alveolar flap" or "flap sound".
- Incorrect: Writes /t/, /d/, or any non-flap symbol.
- Borderline: Writes a vague answer like "soft t" without further explanation.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Many learners think Americans "change t to d"; clarify that both /t/ and /d/ neutralize to [ɾ] in this context [Ref: G5].
- Accent Variants: Flapping is common in AmE, possible but less systematic in some BrE varieties [Ref: L5].
- Regional: Some careful or formal styles may retain [t] instead of [ɾ].
- Contested: Exact environments for flapping can vary by dialect; this item focuses on the core intervocalic pattern.
- Pedagogical: Use waveforms/spectrograms from corpora to contrast [t], [d], and [ɾ].

**Rationale**: T-flapping is a characteristic allophonic process in American English where intervocalic /t/ (and often /d/) before an unstressed syllable is realized as the alveolar tap [ɾ], contributing to the "butter"–"budder" similarity [Ref: G5] [Ref: L5] [Ref: A5].

---

#### Item 4: TH-stopping in Indian English

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Statement**: In many varieties of Indian English, the voiceless dental fricative /θ/ is frequently realized as the dental stop ___ in words like "think" and "thin".

**Acceptable Answers**: ["[t̪]", "t̪"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore brackets and slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Correct symbol `t̪` with or without brackets.
- Partial: Gives a description like "dental t" or "dental stop".
- Incorrect: Writes plain /t/ with no dental diacritic, or uses /s/ or /f/.
- Borderline: Provides the voiced dental stop [d̪]; acceptable in a discussion of the pattern but not for this specific item.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Avoid labeling this as "wrong"; present it as a systematic transfer from L1 phonology [Ref: G7].
- Accent Variants: Indian English shows both /θ/→[t̪] and /ð/→[d̪]; this item isolates the voiceless case [Ref: L6].
- Regional: Not all Indian English speakers show TH-stopping; exposure and education matter.
- Contested: Intelligibility vs nativeness debates should be framed in terms of communicative effectiveness, not "defect" [Ref: A7] [Ref: A8].
- Pedagogical: Use minimal pairs and articulatory diagrams to show tongue placement differences.

**Rationale**: Because most major Indian languages lack dental fricatives, speakers often substitute dental stops, so /θ/ in English is realized as [t̪] in many Indian English accents [Ref: G7] [Ref: L6] [Ref: A7] [Ref: A8].

---

### Topic 3: Word Stress

#### Item 5: Compound noun stress

**Difficulty**: Foundational

**Statement**: In English compound nouns like "BLACKboard" and "GREENhouse", primary stress typically falls on the ___ element of the compound.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["first", "initial"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "first" or an equivalent term like "initial".
- Partial: Writes "left" or "beginning" but clearly refers to the first element.
- Incorrect: Writes "second" or "last".
- Borderline: Gives examples without answering the question explicitly.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Learners often apply sentence-level stress logic to compounds; emphasize lexical vs phrasal stress [Ref: G11].
- Accent Variants: Some compounds allow variable stress (e.g., "ice cream"); this item targets the default pattern.
- Regional: Minor regional differences do not change the basic rule.
- Contested: When ambiguity exists (N+N phrase vs compound), treat both patterns as valid if context is unclear [Ref: L9].
- Pedagogical: Practice with minimal pairs like "BLACK bird" vs "black BIRD".

**Rationale**: English compound nouns typically place primary stress on the first element, which distinguishes them from free phrases where stress is more evenly distributed or final [Ref: G11] [Ref: L9] [Ref: A12].

---

#### Item 6: Stress-shifting suffixes

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Statement**: Adding the derivational suffix ___ (e.g., "photoGRAPHic") usually causes primary stress to shift to the syllable immediately before the suffix.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["-ic", "ic"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (treat "ic" and "-ic" as equivalent)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "-ic" or "ic".
- Partial: Names another stress-attracting suffix (e.g., "-ity", "-tion") but not the one in the example.
- Incorrect: Writes non stress-shifting suffixes like "-ness" or "-ly".
- Borderline: Describes the pattern in words without giving a concrete suffix.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Stress rules are probabilistic; avoid presenting them as exceptionless [Ref: G12].
- Accent Variants: GA and RP broadly agree on the stress-attracting nature of -ic, though some lexical items differ.
- Regional: Some multiword expressions may override the basic suffix rule.
- Contested: Lexicalized exceptions (e.g., "arabÍc") should be mentioned but not tested at this level [Ref: L9].
- Pedagogical: Group stress-shifting suffixes (-ic, -ity, -tion) and practice with word families.

**Rationale**: Suffixes like -ic are stress-attracting, systematically shifting primary stress to the preceding syllable in many derived forms (PHOtograph → photoGRAPHic), reflecting English morphophonological regularities [Ref: G12] [Ref: L9] [Ref: A13].

---

### Topic 4: Connected Speech

#### Item 7: Nasal place assimilation

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: In connected speech, the word-final /n/ in "ten boys" often assimilates to the following bilabial consonant, so the phrase is realized with the bilabial nasal ___ in the cluster.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["[m]", "m"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore brackets)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes `m` (with or without brackets).
- Partial: Describes "bilabial nasal" without giving the symbol.
- Incorrect: Writes `n` or `ŋ`.
- Borderline: Writes "mm" or another orthographic approximation.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Learners may think assimilation is "lazy"; present it as a natural coarticulatory process [Ref: G15].
- Accent Variants: Present in many accents; careful speech may retain [n].
- Regional: Rate and extent of assimilation vary by style and speech rate.
- Contested: The exact phonological representation (underlying vs surface) is theoretical and not tested here [Ref: L5].
- Pedagogical: Use waveform/spectrogram evidence to show place changes.

**Rationale**: Nasal place assimilation changes the alveolar nasal /n/ to [m] before bilabials, reducing articulatory effort in sequences like "ten boys" → [tem bɔɪz] [Ref: G15] [Ref: L5] [Ref: A17].

---

#### Item 8: Coalescent assimilation (would you)

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Statement**: In casual speech, the sequence /d/ + /j/ in "would you" often coalesces into the single affricate ___, producing [wʊdʒu].

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/dʒ/", "dʒ"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore surrounding slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes `dʒ` with or without slashes.
- Partial: Describes "dj becomes a j-sound" without IPA.
- Incorrect: Writes /tʃ/ or /ʒ/.
- Borderline: Writes "j" alone; this could refer to the glide /j/, so only partial credit.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Avoid framing this as "sloppy"; it is a systematic process in fluent speech [Ref: G18].
- Accent Variants: Common in BrE and AmE; careful speech may retain [d j].
- Regional: Some accents may show different degrees of coalescence.
- Contested: Phonological analyses differ on whether this is assimilation or phonemic change [Ref: L10].
- Pedagogical: Practice with other sequences like "did you" and "don't you".

**Rationale**: Coalescent assimilation fuses /d/ + /j/ into /dʒ/ in sequences like "would you", creating affricates from stop+palatal glide clusters [Ref: G18] [Ref: L10] [Ref: A20].

---

### Topic 5: Intonation & Rhythm

#### Item 9: Stress-timed rhythm

**Difficulty**: Foundational

**Statement**: English is often described as a ___-timed language, in contrast with syllable-timed languages like French and Spanish.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["stress", "stress-timed"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (treat "stress timed" and "stress-timed" as equivalent)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "stress" or "stress-timed".
- Partial: Writes "accent-timed" or similar but clearly refers to stressed syllables.
- Incorrect: Writes "syllable" or "mora".
- Borderline: Writes only examples without naming the rhythm type.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Present stress-timing vs syllable-timing as a continuum, not a strict binary [Ref: G19].
- Accent Variants: Some varieties of English (e.g., Indian English) are less clearly stress-timed.
- Regional: Rhythm can change in L2 English depending on L1 background.
- Contested: Recent research questions pure isochrony; clarify that this is a useful pedagogical simplification [Ref: L11] [Ref: A21] [Ref: A22].
- Pedagogical: Use clapping/drumming exercises to feel stressed syllable spacing.

**Rationale**: English is broadly classified as stress-timed, meaning intervals between stressed syllables tend to be more regular than individual syllable durations, though empirical work shows considerable variation [Ref: G19] [Ref: L11] [Ref: A21] [Ref: A22].

---

#### Item 10: Nuclear stress placement

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: In a neutral intonation pattern, nuclear stress in English usually falls on the last ___ word in the intonation phrase.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["content", "lexical"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "content" or "lexical".
- Partial: Writes "important" or "main" word but does not specify content vs function.
- Incorrect: Writes "function".
- Borderline: Gives an example but no explicit answer.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Learners may overgeneralize this rule and ignore information structure [Ref: G20].
- Accent Variants: Rule is widely shared across standard accents.
- Regional: Small variation in phrasing does not change the underlying principle.
- Contested: Focus and contrast can move nuclear stress earlier; make clear this item is about unmarked patterns [Ref: L12].
- Pedagogical: Use short dialogues to compare default vs contrastive stress.

**Rationale**: The nuclear stress rule places the main pitch accent on the rightmost content word in an intonation phrase under neutral information structure conditions [Ref: G20] [Ref: L12] [Ref: A23].

---

### Topic 6: American vs British

#### Item 11: NURSE vowel in AmE vs BrE

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Statement**: The NURSE vowel (as in "bird", "word", "hurt") is typically realized as the rhotic vowel ___ in General American and as the non-rhotic [ɜː] in RP.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/ɝ/", "ɝ"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes `ɝ` with or without slashes.
- Partial: Writes "/ɜːr/" or describes "r-colored mid-central vowel".
- Incorrect: Writes /ɜː/ without rhoticity or uses /ər/ only.
- Borderline: Writes "er"; partial credit if accompanied by an articulatory description.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Avoid judging rhotic vs non-rhotic as "better"; present as systematic differences [Ref: G23].
- Accent Variants: Some BrE accents show partial rhoticity; some AmE varieties reduce rhoticity.
- Regional: Scottish English behaves differently and is not fully captured by this contrast.
- Contested: For teaching, many materials use /ɜːr/ for AmE; clarify symbol choices [Ref: L1].
- Pedagogical: Use listening discrimination between rhotic and non-rhotic NURSE vowels.

**Rationale**: The NURSE lexical set highlights a core difference between rhotic AmE (r-colored vowel /ɝ/) and non-rhotic RP (mid-central vowel /ɜː/ without post-vocalic /r/) [Ref: G23] [Ref: L1] [Ref: A1] [Ref: A6].

---

#### Item 12: Yod-dropping in American English

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: Compared with British English, American English more extensively drops the palatal glide ___ after alveolar consonants in words like "tune", "dune", and "news".

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/j/", "j"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes `j` with or without slashes.
- Partial: Writes "y-sound" or "/juː/" and clearly identifies the glide.
- Incorrect: Writes other consonants such as /w/.
- Borderline: Gives only examples without naming the segment.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Many think British English always keeps /j/; in fact, yod-dropping is increasing there too [Ref: G25].
- Accent Variants: Some AmE varieties retain /j/ after certain consonants; the pattern is not uniform [Ref: L4].
- Regional: Yod-dropping interacts with lexical and social factors.
- Contested: Spelling vs sound confusion ("new" vs "knew") should be handled carefully [Ref: A4] [Ref: A28].
- Pedagogical: Use minimal pairs and IPA transcriptions to illustrate presence/absence of /j/.

**Rationale**: American English shows more extensive dropping of the palatal glide /j/ after alveolars ("tune"→/tuːn/), whereas conservative RP typically retains it ("tune"→/tjuːn/) [Ref: G25] [Ref: L4] [Ref: A4] [Ref: A28].

### Topic 7: Indian English & Other Accents

#### Item 13: Retroflex stop in Indian English

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Statement**: A characteristic consonant of Indian English is the voiceless retroflex stop, written in IPA as ___, produced with the tongue tip curled back toward the hard palate.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["/ʈ/", "ʈ"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (ignore slashes)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes `ʈ` with or without slashes.
- Partial: Describes "retroflex t" without the IPA symbol.
- Incorrect: Writes plain /t/ or other stops.
- Borderline: Writes `ɖ` (voiced retroflex); partial credit with explanation.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Present retroflexes as part of many Indian languages, not as "errors" [Ref: G27].
- Accent Variants: Degree of retroflexion varies across speakers and regions.
- Regional: Not all Indian English speakers use strong retroflexes in English.
- Contested: Exact phonemic status of retroflex vs alveolar contrasts in English is debated [Ref: L6].
- Pedagogical: Use articulatory diagrams and minimal pairs where relevant.

**Rationale**: Indian English commonly features retroflex stops like /ʈ/, reflecting the transfer of phonemic retroflexes from languages such as Hindi and Tamil into English [Ref: G27] [Ref: L6] [Ref: A7] [Ref: A29].

---

#### Item 14: Rhythm in Indian English

**Difficulty**: Foundational

**Statement**: Because Indian English typically shows less vowel reduction in unstressed syllables than British or American English, its rhythm is often described as more ___-timed.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["syllable", "syllable-timed"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic (treat "syllable timed" and "syllable-timed" as equivalent)
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "syllable" or "syllable-timed".
- Partial: Writes "more even" or similar phrase that implies syllable timing.
- Incorrect: Writes "stress".
- Borderline: Gives examples without naming the rhythm type.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Avoid stereotyping Indian English as "flat"; pitch range can be large [Ref: L13].
- Accent Variants: Educated Indian English may vary depending on exposure.
- Regional: Different Indian L1s contribute different rhythmic patterns [Ref: A24].
- Contested: Rhythm classification is approximate; use it as a teaching heuristic [Ref: A30].
- Pedagogical: Compare recordings of Indian vs British English sentences with the same content.

**Rationale**: Indian English often exhibits features associated with syllable-timing, such as reduced vowel centralization in unstressed syllables, reflecting influence from syllable-timed L1s [Ref: G19] [Ref: L13] [Ref: A24] [Ref: A30].

### Topic 8: Problematic Sounds

#### Item 15: /l/–/r/ distinction for Japanese learners

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: Japanese learners often struggle with English /l/–/r/ minimal pairs because Japanese has a single ___ liquid phoneme, typically transcribed /ɾ/, that falls between English /l/ and /r/ in articulation.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["liquid", "tap"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "liquid" or "tap".
- Partial: Writes "sound" but adds a clear description like "between l and r".
- Incorrect: Writes "vowel" or unrelated term.
- Borderline: Gives only examples ("light/right") without the category name.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Emphasize perception difficulties, not just production [Ref: G30].
- Accent Variants: Some learners may acquire near-native contrasts with training [Ref: L17].
- Regional: Differences exist among Japanese dialects and individuals.
- Contested: Degree of difficulty varies; avoid overgeneralizing [Ref: A34] [Ref: A35].
- Pedagogical: Use explicit perception training plus articulatory feedback.

**Rationale**: Japanese has a single alveolar tap /ɾ/ instead of separate /l/ and /r/ phonemes, leading to both perceptual and production challenges for English /l/–/r/ contrasts [Ref: G30] [Ref: L17] [Ref: A34] [Ref: A35].

---

#### Item 16: TRAP vs DRESS minimal pairs

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Statement**: Learners whose L1 lacks the low front vowel /æ/ often confuse minimal pairs like "bad" /bæd/ and "bed" /bɛd/ because both vowels are ___ front vowels and close in acoustic space.

**Acceptable Answers**: ["unrounded", "front"]

**Normalization**:
- Case: insensitive
- Whitespace: trim, normalize
- Punctuation: strip non-semantic
- Numeric: N/A
- Units: N/A

**Grading**:
- Full: Writes "front" or "unrounded".
- Partial: Writes "similar" or "open" plus a clearly correct explanation.
- Incorrect: Writes "back" or "rounded".
- Borderline: Only gives examples without specifying the shared property.

**Fairness**:
- Learner Misconceptions: Many learners think English has only one /e/-like vowel; highlight TRAP vs DRESS distinction [Ref: G31].
- Accent Variants: Some dialects slightly shift these vowels but keep them contrastive.
- Regional: Use acoustic diagrams to show F1/F2 differences rather than relying on spelling [Ref: L18].
- Contested: Descriptions differ (low vs near-low); focus on functional contrast.
- Pedagogical: Work with focused minimal-pair drills and feedback.

**Rationale**: The TRAP /æ/ and DRESS /ɛ/ vowels are both front and unrounded, making them acoustically similar for learners whose L1 lacks a comparable low front vowel, which leads to confusion in perception and production [Ref: G31] [Ref: L18] [Ref: A36].
