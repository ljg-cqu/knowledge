## Scenario Bank (Scenarios 1–3)

### Cluster 1: Vowels – /ɪ/ vs /iː/ (KIT vs FLEECE)

#### Scenario 1: "ship" vs "sheep" for Mandarin L1 learners
**Difficulty**: Foundational | **Focus**: Vowel quality and length (/ɪ/ vs /iː/) | **Profile**: Mandarin L1, B1–B2, GA target

**Context**

Mandarin does not contrast tense–lax pairs like English /ɪ/ (KIT) vs /iː/ (FLEECE). Learners often produce a single high front vowel close to [i] for both, causing minimal pairs like "ship" /ʃɪp/ and "sheep" /ʃiːp/ to merge and creating misunderstandings in listening and speaking tasks `[Ref: G1, G4, A6]`.

In both GA and RP, /iː/ is typically longer and has a lower F1 and slightly lower F2 than /ɪ/; /ɪ/ is lower and more central `[Ref: G4, A8]`. High-frequency exam vocabulary ("leave/live", "cheap/chip", "least/list") depends on this contrast. Many Mandarin speakers perceive the difference but do not consistently produce it, especially in unstressed syllables or fast speech. This scenario targets perception, IPA awareness, and controlled production using minimal pairs and vowel charts, then moves towards sentence-level practice with recording and visual feedback `[Ref: T1, T5]`.

**Task 1: IPA Discrimination (20 pts)**

Listen to 12 words (audio) and label them as KIT /ɪ/ or FLEECE /iː/: *fit, feel, leave, live, list, least, pitch, peach, reach, rich, fill, feel*.

- **Expected**: 12/12 correct; clear awareness that vowels differ in both quality and length, not just loudness. Learners can point to two distinct areas on a simple vowel chart `[Ref: G3, A6]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): 12 correct + chart explanation | Partial (14): 10–11 correct | Minimal (8): 8–9 correct | Zero: ≤7 correct.

**Task 2: Minimal Pairs & Spelling Patterns (20 pts)**

Group the following pairs and write IPA (GA or RP): *ship/sheep, live/leave, pitch/peach, list/least, rich/reach*.

- **Expected**:
  - ship /ʃɪp/ – sheep /ʃiːp/
  - live /lɪv/ – leave /liːv/
  - pitch /pɪtʃ/ – peach /piːtʃ/
  - list /lɪst/ – least /liːst/
  - rich /rɪtʃ/ – reach /riːtʃ/
  - Noticing: many FLEECE words use **ee, ea, e+silent e**, but spelling is not fully reliable `[Ref: T1, L1]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): all IPA correct + at least one accurate observation about spelling vs sound | Partial (14): 3–4 pairs correct | Minimal (8): 2 correct | Zero: ≤1.

**Task 3: Production & Self-Monitoring (20 pts)**

Design a short practice routine using your own name and daily context.

- **Expected**:
  1. 5 minimal pairs (ship/sheep, live/leave, rich/reach, list/least, pitch/peach) spoken in isolation.
  2. Short sentences: "The ship will leave at six" vs "The sheep will leave at six".
  3. Recording with a phone; learner marks perceived differences and checks with vowel chart or Praat formant plot (F1 higher for /ɪ/, F2 higher and closer to /iː/) `[Ref: T5, A6]`.
  4. Weekly goal: 5 minutes/day for 2 weeks.
- **Grading**: Full (20): clear routine + self-assessment step | Partial (14): routine but no self-check | Minimal (8): list of words only | Zero: vague answer.

**Common Omissions**: Focusing only on length and ignoring quality; treating /ɪ/ as /i/; forgetting that in unstressed syllables both vowels often reduce to /ɪ/ or /ə/.

### Cluster 2: Consonants – /l/ vs /ɹ/ (Laterals vs Rhotics)

#### Scenario 2: Japanese L1 engineer working in a GA environment
**Difficulty**: Intermediate | **Focus**: /l/ vs /ɹ/ contrast | **Profile**: Japanese L1, B2, GA target (North American team)

**Context**

Japanese has a single liquid phoneme usually realized between [ɾ] and [l]. Learners often substitute this sound for both English /l/ and /ɹ/, creating confusion in minimal pairs such as "light" vs "right", "glass" vs "grass" `[Ref: G1, G2]`. In GA, /l/ is a lateral approximant with tongue contact at the alveolar ridge, while /ɹ/ is a postalveolar approximant with no central contact and tongue retraction/curving `[Ref: A8]`. In RP, /ɹ/ never appears in syllable-final position (non-rhotic), but in GA it does `[Ref: G6, A2]`.

This learner works in software development and frequently attends stand-ups where task names like "release", "rollback", and "logs" must be pronounced clearly. Mispronunciations sometimes cause clarification sequences that slow meetings and create minor embarrassment.

**Task 1: Minimal Pair Sorting (20 pts)**

Sort the following into /l/–/ɹ/ minimal pairs and write IPA: *light, right, glass, grass, play, pray, fly, fry, collect, correct*.

- **Expected**:
  - /laɪt/–/ɹaɪt/, /ɡlæs/–/ɡɹæs/, /pleɪ/–/pɹeɪ/, /flaɪ/–/fɹaɪ/, /kəˈlekt/–/kəˈɹekt/ (GA)
  - Awareness that /ɹ/ has no tongue contact at the alveolar ridge and is produced slightly further back `[Ref: G3, A8]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): all pairs + correct IPA | Partial (14): 3–4 pairs or minor IPA errors | Minimal (8): 2 pairs | Zero: ≤1.

**Task 2: Articulation Description (20 pts)**

Describe in 4–6 sentences how your tongue and lips move differently for /l/ and /ɹ/ in GA. Include at least one self-monitoring cue.

- **Expected**:
  - /l/: tongue tip touches alveolar ridge, air flows around sides, clearer at word beginnings.
  - /ɹ/: tongue never fully touches the ridge; either bunched or retroflex, lips may round slightly; central airflow `[Ref: A8, L2]`.
  - One cue, e.g., "If my tongue touches the ridge, I should feel /l/, not /ɹ/."
- **Grading**: Full (20): accurate and contrastive description + cue | Partial (14): mostly accurate but not contrastive | Minimal (8): vague, partly wrong | Zero: misleading.

**Task 3: Communication Practice (20 pts)**

Create three sentences from your work context where /l/–/ɹ/ contrast matters (e.g., "rollback the release log"). Practise in this order: slow reading, normal speed, then in a short stand-up simulation with a colleague or recording.

- **Expected**:
  - 3 realistic sentences; deliberate slow practice; at least one plan for feedback (colleague or recording).
- **Grading**: Full (20): 3 sentences + two-speed practice + feedback plan | Partial (14): 2 sentences or missing plan | Minimal (8): 1 sentence | Zero: none.

**Common Omissions**: Using tapping /ɾ/ for everything; ignoring GA vs RP rhoticity; practising words in isolation only, not in phrases.

### Cluster 3: Connected Speech & Stress – Weak Forms and Rhythm

#### Scenario 3: Spanish L1 learner preparing for IELTS speaking
**Difficulty**: Advanced | **Focus**: Weak forms, stress-timing, linking | **Profile**: Spanish L1, B2–C1, aiming 7.0+ on IELTS speaking, GA/RP both acceptable

**Context**

Spanish is more syllable-timed, with relatively even syllable length. English (GA/RP) is stress-timed: content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) carry stress, while function words (articles, prepositions, auxiliaries) are often reduced to weak forms /ə, ɪ, əv, tə/ `[Ref: G8, G12, A4]`. This learner sounds "robotic" in mock speaking tests: pronounces each word clearly but with little reduction or linking. Examiners report that the speech is clear but not natural and sometimes too slow.

**Task 1: Strong vs Weak Forms (20 pts)**

Mark stressed content words and choose weak vs strong forms in the sentence:

> *I can go to the meeting if you want to, but I don't have to.*

- **Expected**:
  - Stress on *I, go, meeting, want, don't, have*.
  - Weak forms: *can* /kən/, *to* /tə/, *the* /ðə/, *if* often reduced in connected speech, *have to* /ˈhæf tə/ `[Ref: G12, A3]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): correct stress and weak forms | Partial (14): most correct | Minimal (8): some awareness | Zero: all strong forms.

**Task 2: Linking & Chunking (20 pts)**

Rewrite the sentence into tone units with linking marks (→) and record yourself twice: slow and natural speed.

- **Expected**:
  - Example: *I can go* → *to the meeting* → *if you want to* → *but I don't have to*.
  - Linking: /goʊ tə ðə/; *want to* → /ˈwɒnə/ or /ˈwɑːnə/ in informal GA `[Ref: G10, G11]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): sensible chunking + at least 2–3 linking points | Partial (14): chunking only | Minimal (8): partial | Zero: unchanged.

**Task 3: Intelligibility vs Naturalness Reflection (20 pts)**

Write a short reflection (80–120 words) on when you should prioritise clarity (strong forms, careful speech) vs natural rhythm (more weak forms, linking) – for example, in exams, meetings, or presentations.

- **Expected**: Recognises that intelligibility is primary; weak forms should not reduce clarity; GA/RP norms are guides, not rules `[Ref: L2, A7]`.
- **Grading**: Full (20): balanced view with 2–3 concrete situations | Partial (14): opinionated but unbalanced | Minimal (8): very general | Zero: off-topic.

**Common Omissions**: Over-correction (reducing every function word); assuming fast speech is always better; ignoring listener background.

## Pedagogical Synthesis

### High-Impact Features Across Scenarios `[Ref: L1, L2]`

1. **Segmental Vowels (/ɪ/ vs /iː/)**: Small quality/length differences can carry heavy lexical load (ship/sheep). Visualising vowels on a chart and checking formants in Praat helps learners avoid relying only on spelling.
2. **Liquid Consonants (/l/ vs /ɹ/)**: For many L1s with a single liquid, explicit contrastive articulation (tongue contact vs no contact) is more effective than general "repeat-after-me" drills.
3. **Weak Forms & Rhythm**: Teaching learners to identify content vs function words and decide when to reduce (and when not to) connects pronunciation practice with discourse and pragmatics.

### L1 Transfer Patterns

| L1       | Typical Issues                    | Priority                | Recommended Focus            |
|----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Mandarin | KIT/FLEECE, final consonants     | High (lexical contrast) | Vowel chart, minimal pairs   |
| Japanese | /l/–/ɹ/ contrast, syllable-timing| High (workplace terms)  | Articulation, work sentences |
| Spanish  | Stress-timing, weak forms        | Medium–High (fluency)   | Chunking, rhythm, weak forms |

### Teaching Sequence (Adapted)

1. **Perception first**: Minimal pairs and noticing tasks before demanding native-like production.
2. **Explicit instruction**: Articulatory descriptions and IPA, linked to L1 comparisons.
3. **Controlled practice**: From isolated sounds to words, phrases, and short sentences.
4. **Communicative practice**: Role-plays (stand-ups, meetings, exams) for each scenario.
5. **Self-monitoring**: Regular recording, optional Praat analysis, peer feedback, and simple intelligibility checks.
