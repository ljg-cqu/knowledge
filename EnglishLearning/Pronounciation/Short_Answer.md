 ## Problems
 
 ### Vowels
 
 #### P1: FLEECE vs KIT - "sheep" vs "ship"
 **Difficulty**: F | **Type**: IPA/Minimal Pair
 **Accents**: GA, RP, Indian
 
 **Problem**: Contrast the vowels in "sheep" and "ship" in GA, RP, and educated Indian English. Give phonemic IPA for each word and one reliable perceptual cue learners can use. [Ref: G4] [Ref: L2]
 **Given**: Sentence: "The sheep is near the ship." Target accents: General American (GA), contemporary RP, educated urban Indian English.
 **Assumptions**: Careful citation-style speech; no strong regional coloring; educated speakers. [Ref: L1]
 
 **Answer**: GA/RP: "sheep" /ʃiːp/, "ship" /ʃɪp/; Indian English: typically similar contrast, sometimes with slightly shorter /iː/. | **Tolerance**: Any answer that clearly distinguishes /iː/ vs /ɪ/ and keeps the minimal-pair contrast.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Identify lexical sets: FLEECE /iː/ vs KIT /ɪ/ and assign each word. [Ref: G4]
 2. Describe quality: /iː/ is higher and tenser with longer duration; /ɪ/ is lower and laxer.
 3. Explain that Indian English often shortens /iː/, so duration is a weaker cue and quality (height) matters more. [Ref: L5]
 4. Suggest minimal-pair drills and spectrogram inspection focusing on F1 (height) and length.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some Northern English accents centralize KIT, increasing distance from FLEECE.
 **Acoustics**: FLEECE has lower F1 and often slightly higher F2 than KIT, plus longer duration. [Ref: L8]
 **L1 Interference**: Learners from languages with a single high front vowel (e.g., Spanish, Korean) may map both English vowels to one category.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Teachers can exaggerate length differences (clear but slightly unnatural) or focus on subtle quality differences (more authentic but harder to hear at first); learners should avoid generalizing extreme lengthening to all contexts.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correct IPA in at least one accent plus a clear height/length cue; partial credit if contrast is described but symbols are approximate. | **Common Errors**: Using the same symbol for both words or ignoring accent labels.

 #### P2: TRAP vs BATH - "bath" in GA vs RP
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Accent/IPA
 **Accents**: GA, RP, Australian
 
 **Problem**: Give phonemic IPA for "bath" in GA, RP, and General Australian English and briefly explain how the TRAP–BATH split affects learner expectations. [Ref: G2] [Ref: L1]
 **Given**: Phrase: "Take a bath." Target accents as above.
 **Assumptions**: Citation form; no strong regional London or Northern American varieties.
 
 **Answer**: GA: /bæθ/; RP: /bɑːθ/; General Australian: often /baːθ/ with fronted PALM. | **Tolerance**: Accept /ɑː/ vs /aː/ variation if lexical-set difference is explained.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Classify "bath" as TRAP in GA but BATH/PALM in RP/Aus; summarize the TRAP–BATH split. [Ref: G2]
 2. Describe tongue position: /æ/ is low front; /ɑː/ or /aː/ is low back/central, often longer.
 3. Explain that dictionaries often mark both variants, so learners must choose a model rather than mixing at random. [Ref: L3]
 4. Recommend building lexical lists of BATH words to avoid word-by-word guessing.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Northern England accents typically use /æ/ (no split), so learners may hear multiple patterns even within the UK.
 **Acoustics**: BATH/PALM has lower F2 than TRAP and often greater duration. [Ref: L8]
 **L1 Interference**: Learners with only one low vowel may treat both as identical and miss the sociolinguistic signal.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Teaching GA first simplifies the system; teaching RP/Aus gives broader passive understanding but increases lexical load.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correct IPA in at least two accents plus an explanation of lexical sets; partial credit if only "American vs British" difference is mentioned. | **Common Errors**: Assuming all non-American English uses /ɑː/ in all TRAP words.
 
 ---
 
 #### P3: GOAT Vowel - "home" in GA vs RP
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: IPA/Accent
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Transcribe "home" in GA and RP using IPA and explain one main difference in the GOAT diphthong onset. [Ref: G1] [Ref: L4]
 **Given**: Sentence: "She stayed home." Target accents: GA and contemporary RP.
 **Assumptions**: Standard GA and General British; no strong regional monophthongization.
 
 **Answer**: GA: /hoʊm/; RP: /həʊm/. | **Tolerance**: Slight differences in starting quality (e.g., [o] vs [ə]) are acceptable if diphthongal movement is noted.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Identify GOAT lexical set and standard transcriptions. [Ref: G1]
 2. Describe GA onset as a mid-back [o] and RP onset as more centralized [ə]. [Ref: L4]
 3. Note that both move toward a higher closer offglide [ʊ].
 4. Suggest learners compare minimal pairs like "goat" vs "got" in both accents.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some Northern English and Scottish accents use monophthongs (e.g., [oː]).
 **Acoustics**: Diphthongs show clear formant movement (F1, F2) rather than a flat trajectory. [Ref: L8]
 **L1 Interference**: Monophthong-only vowel systems may lead learners to under-realize the glide.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: A more monophthongal [oː] can sound less regionally marked but reduces contrast with LOT in some dialects.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correct IPA in both accents plus one articulatory or acoustic difference; partial credit if only one accent is handled. | **Common Errors**: Using /oʊ/ for RP or /əʊ/ for GA without comment.
 
 ---
 
 ### Consonants
 
 #### P4: T-Flapping - "better" in GA vs RP
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Connected/Consonant
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Transcribe "better" in GA and RP in connected speech and describe when /t/ becomes an alveolar flap [ɾ] in GA. [Ref: G5] [Ref: L5]
 **Given**: Phrase: "It’s better now." Focus on intervocalic /t/.
 **Assumptions**: Casual but clear speech; no strong regional variation.
 
 **Answer**: GA: [ˈbɛɾər] or [ˈbɛɾɚ]; RP: [ˈbetə]. | **Tolerance**: Accept underlying /ˈbɛtər/ with explanation that [ɾ] is an allophone in GA.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. State the GA rule: /t, d/ → [ɾ] between vowels when the following syllable is unstressed. [Ref: G5]
 2. Show that RP usually keeps [t], though some speakers also flap in informal styles. [Ref: L5]
 3. Emphasize that flapping is style-dependent and does not change underlying phonemes.
 4. Suggest slow–fast repetition drills so learners can feel the articulatory change from stop to tap.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some British and Australian varieties use [ɾ] in similar environments.
 **Acoustics**: Flaps have very short contact and little aspiration, unlike [tʰ]. [Ref: L8]
 **L1 Interference**: Learners may mis-hear [ɾ] as /d/ and mis-spell words.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Teaching flapping improves naturalness but may initially obscure spelling–sound mapping.
 **Grading**: Full credit for giving both allophone environment and accent difference; partial credit if flapping is mentioned but not conditioned. | **Common Errors**: Claiming GA "has no /t/" in words like "better".
 
 ---
 
 #### P5: TH-Stopping - "think" and "this" in Indian English
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Consonant/Accent
 **Accents**: GA, RP, Indian
 
 **Problem**: Compare the pronunciation of "think" and "this" in GA, RP, and educated Indian English. Give IPA and describe TH-stopping. [Ref: G7] [Ref: L6]
 **Given**: Utterance: "I think this works." Target accents above.
 **Assumptions**: Educated urban Indian English; no extreme regional accents.
 
 **Answer**: GA/RP: "think" /θɪŋk/, "this" /ðɪs/; many Indian English varieties: [t̪ɪŋk], [d̪ɪs]. | **Tolerance**: Accept [s]/[z] substitutions if clearly labeled as non-target variants.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Define dental fricatives /θ, ð/ and note their absence in most Indian languages. [Ref: G7]
 2. Describe TH-stopping: systematic substitution with dental plosives [t̪, d̪] in many Indian English accents. [Ref: L6]
 3. Explain that this rarely impairs intelligibility locally but may matter in international exams.
 4. Suggest articulatory drills using a mirror to show tongue placement between the teeth vs behind them.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some Indian English speakers approximate [θ, ð] more closely, especially after training.
 **Acoustics**: Fricatives show continuous noise; stops have a clear burst and silence.
 **L1 Interference**: Strong transfer from L1 dental stop systems leads to consistent [t̪, d̪].
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: For some learners, aiming for slightly laminal [θ] may be more realistic than perfect interdental articulation.
 **Grading**: Full credit for accurate IPA in at least two accents and clear description of the process; partial credit if only "t instead of th" is mentioned. | **Common Errors**: Treating TH-stopping as random "mispronunciation" instead of a rule-governed pattern.

 ### Suprasegmentals
 
 #### P6: Compound Noun Stress - "blackboard" vs "black board"
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Stress
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Show how stress distinguishes "blackboard" (compound noun) from "black board" (adjective + noun) and give IPA for both in GA or RP. [Ref: G11] [Ref: L9]
 **Given**: Sentences: "Write it on the blackboard." vs "Paint the black board." 
 **Assumptions**: Neutral, non-contrastive contexts.
 
 **Answer**: Compound: /ˈblækbɔːd/; phrase: /blæk ˈbɔːd/ (similar in GA/RP, with small vowel differences). | **Tolerance**: Accept /ɔr/ vs /ɔː/ for GA as long as stress placement is correct.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. State compound stress rule: English compound nouns usually take main stress on the first element. [Ref: G11]
 2. Contrast with phrases, where the second element often carries main stress.
 3. Show how stress misplacement can change interpretation or create processing delay.
 4. Recommend that learners mark stress for new compound vocabulary in notebooks.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some compounds are variable (e.g., "ice cream"), so dictionaries and corpora should be consulted.
 **Acoustics**: Stressed syllables show higher pitch, greater intensity, and longer duration.
 **L1 Interference**: Speakers of syllable-timed languages may distribute stress more evenly, weakening the contrast.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Over-emphasizing stress can sound unnatural but helps learners notice patterns early.
 **Grading**: Full credit for IPA with correct stress and a clear explanation; partial credit if only the rule is stated without examples. | **Common Errors**: Assuming stress is free or purely stylistic.
 
 ---
 
 #### P7: Verb–Noun Stress Alternation - "record"
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Stress/Morphology
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Provide IPA for "record" as a noun and as a verb in GA or RP and explain how stress signals grammatical category. [Ref: G11] [Ref: L9]
 **Given**: Sentences: "I bought the record." vs "Please record this." 
 **Assumptions**: Neutral intonation; no extra contrastive focus.
 
 **Answer**: Noun: /ˈrekɔːd/; verb: /rɪˈkɔːd/ (RP-like values). | **Tolerance**: Accept GA vowels (e.g., /ˈrɛkɔːrd/) if stress positions are correct.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Describe the productive pattern where many two-syllable noun/verb pairs differ mainly by stress position. [Ref: L9]
 2. Explain that stress shift may trigger vowel reduction in the now-unstressed syllable.
 3. Show how listeners use stress to disambiguate category quickly.
 4. Suggest building personal lists of such pairs (REcord/reCORD, INcrease/inCREASE).
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some dialects reduce the difference in fast speech.
 **Acoustics**: Primary stress correlates with greater amplitude and clearer vowel quality.
 **L1 Interference**: Languages without stress-based category marking may lead learners to rely only on syntax.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Rule-based teaching is helpful, but memorizing high-frequency pairs is essential.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correct IPA for both forms and a clear category explanation; partial credit if only one form is treated. | **Common Errors**: Claiming stress is "optional" here.
 
 ---
 
 ### Connected Speech
 
 #### P8: Weak Forms - "can" and "to"
 **Difficulty**: F | **Type**: Connected Speech/Function Words
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Give strong and weak forms of "can" and "to" in GA or RP and explain when weak forms are used. [Ref: G16] [Ref: L5]
 **Given**: Sentences: "I can do it" (neutral) vs "Yes, I CAN" (contrastive); "Go to school" (neutral).
 **Assumptions**: Conversational speech among peers.
 
 **Answer**: "can" strong /kæn/, weak /kən/; "to" strong /tuː/, weak /tə/ or /tʊ/. | **Tolerance**: Accept accent-specific variants (e.g., /tɘ/) if reduction and stress conditions are correct.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Define weak forms as reduced unstressed variants of function words. [Ref: G16]
 2. Explain that weak forms occur when the word is not in focus, while strong forms appear under emphasis, contrast, or isolation. [Ref: L5]
 3. Show that using only strong forms makes English sound overly careful and disrupts stress timing.
 4. Recommend that learners mark nuclear stress first, then decide which function words should be weak.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Indian English often lacks weak forms, preserving full vowels. [Ref: L6]
 **Acoustics**: Weak forms show shorter duration, central vowels, and lower intensity.
 **L1 Interference**: Syllable-timed L1s encourage full vowels everywhere.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Focusing on perception first helps learners recognize weak forms before trying to produce them consistently.
 **Grading**: Full credit for one strong + one weak form per word plus usage rule; partial credit if only strong forms are listed. | **Common Errors**: Thinking weak forms are "lazy" rather than systematic.
 
 ---
 
 #### P9: Linking vs Intrusive /r/ - "far away" and "law and order"
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Connected Speech/Accent
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Explain the difference between linking-r and intrusive-r using "far away" and "law and order" in non-rhotic RP, and provide IPA examples. [Ref: G14] [Ref: L10]
 **Given**: Phrases as above.
 **Assumptions**: Non-rhotic RP; GA used only as a contrast.
 
 **Answer**: RP: "far away" [fɑːr əˈweɪ] with linking /r/ (spelt <r>); "law and order" [lɔːr ən ˈɔːdə] with intrusive /r/ (no <r> in spelling). GA pronounces /r/ in both due to rhoticity. | **Tolerance**: Minor vowel differences accepted.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Define linking-r as pronunciation of etymological /r/ only before vowels in non-rhotic accents. [Ref: G14]
 2. Define intrusive-r as inserted /r/ between vowels where no historical /r/ exists, often after /ə, ɑː, ɔː/. [Ref: L10]
 3. Contrast with rhotic GA where /r/ is pronounced wherever written and intrusive-r is rare.
 4. Advise learners targeting RP to master when /r/ surfaces, but learners targeting GA can mostly follow spelling.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Some formal RP speakers avoid intrusive-r; casual speech uses it widely.
 **Acoustics**: /r/ introduces characteristic F3-lowering transitions between vowels.
 **L1 Interference**: Learners from non-rhotic L1s may over-insert /r/; others may underuse it.
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: For most EFL learners, copying GA rhoticity is simpler; understanding RP patterns remains important for listening.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correctly distinguishing linking vs intrusive /r/ with examples; partial credit if only one is described. | **Common Errors**: Saying RP "never pronounces final /r/".

 ### Problematic Sounds
 
 #### P10: /l/ vs /r/ for Japanese Learners - "light" vs "right"
 **Difficulty**: I | **Type**: Problematic Sounds/Minimal Pair
 **Accents**: GA, RP
 
 **Problem**: Using the minimal pair "light" vs "right", give IPA and describe why Japanese learners often confuse these sounds. [Ref: G30] [Ref: L17]
 **Given**: Words in isolation and in short phrases: "turn on the light" vs "turn right".
 **Assumptions**: Standard GA or RP.
 
 **Answer**: GA-like: /laɪt/ vs /raɪt/. | **Tolerance**: Accept [ɹ] for /r/ and both GA/RP vowel qualities.
 
 **Solution**:
 1. Define English /l/ (lateral approximant) vs /r/ (rhotic approximant). [Ref: G30]
 2. Explain that Japanese has a single liquid /ɾ/ (alveolar tap) that occupies the space between English /l/ and /r/, so learners map both English phonemes onto one L1 category. [Ref: L17]
 3. Describe that perception problems arise first; production improves when new categories are formed.
 4. Suggest perception training with synthetic continua between [la] and [ra], plus mirror work showing tongue sides vs central airflow.
 
 **Regional Variants**: Dark /l/ in coda position increases acoustic distance from /r/.
 **Acoustics**: /l/ shows lateral anti-resonances and often lower F2 (especially in dark /l/), while /r/ shows strong F3 lowering.
 **L1 Interference**: Japanese learners may produce an intermediate sound for both, which native listeners may categorize inconsistently. [Ref: A34]
 **Alternatives & Trade-offs**: Focusing on perception yields more stable long-term gains than forcing early production contrast.
 **Grading**: Full credit for correct IPA plus explanation involving Japanese /ɾ/; partial credit if only an articulatory description is given. | **Common Errors**: Saying "Japanese has no /r/" without mentioning the existing liquid.
