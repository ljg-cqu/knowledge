# English Prepositions with Distributed Systems Examples

A comprehensive guide to English prepositions with example sentences focused on distributed systems concepts including consensus, replication, partitioning, fault tolerance, and consistency.

## Simple Prepositions

### A

**About**
- *Concerning, regarding*
  - The distributed systems engineer provided information about consensus algorithm selection.
  - The developer shared details about replication strategy optimization techniques.
  - The systems team discussed concerns about partition tolerance and data consistency.

**Above**
- *Higher than, over*
  - The system availability remained above the five nines reliability target.
  - The replication throughput scaled above anticipated data volume requirements.
  - The consensus latency stayed above acceptable distributed coordination thresholds.

**Across**
- *From one side to the other*
  - The distributed data replicates across multiple geographic regions.
  - The consensus protocol operates across geographically distributed nodes.
  - The system partitioning spans across different availability zones.

**After**
- *Following in time*
  - The distributed commit occurs after all nodes reach consensus agreement.
  - The replication synchronization happens after detecting data changes.
  - The partition recovery begins after network connectivity restoration.

**Against**
- *In opposition to*
  - The distributed system protects against Byzantine failure scenarios.
  - The consensus algorithm guards against split-brain conditions.
  - The replication strategy defends against data corruption events.

**Along**
- *In company with, beside*
  - The distributed development progresses along with fault tolerance requirements.
  - The consensus implementation follows along established protocol specifications.
  - The replication design operates along eventual consistency principles.

**Among**
- *In the middle of (three or more)*
  - The leader election selects coordinators among all available nodes.
  - The distributed load balancer routes requests among multiple server instances.
  - The engineer chose the best approach among several partitioning strategies.

**Around**
- *Surrounding, approximately*
  - The distributed architecture is designed around CAP theorem constraints.
  - The consensus completion time averaged around 100 milliseconds per round.
  - The replication strategy revolves around maintaining data availability.

**At**
- *Specific location or time*
  - The distributed coordination occurs at the consensus protocol layer.
  - The replication processing happens at the storage engine level.
  - The partition detection takes place at the network monitoring interface.

This comprehensive guide covers major English prepositions with distributed systems-focused examples, helping learners understand preposition usage within the context of consensus protocols, data replication, system partitioning, and fault-tolerant architectures.
