# All English Prepositions with Examples - OpenZeppelin

**Comprehensive Reference Guide**

Updated: December 2024

## Introduction

English prepositions are words that connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other elements within a sentence, indicating relationships of direction, location, time, or other abstract connections. They function as "connector words" that link various parts of a sentence, making its meaning clear. For instance, "I went *to* the OpenZeppelin security patterns workshop" shows "to" connecting the location "workshop" to the action of going. There are approximately 150 prepositions in English, and three of the most commonly used words—"of," "to," and "in"—are prepositions. Prepositions are considered a 'closed class' of words, meaning new words are rarely added to this group over time.

**Note**: Each meaning entry below includes exactly three example sentences to demonstrate proper usage in different contexts, specifically related to OpenZeppelin smart contract library and security patterns.
