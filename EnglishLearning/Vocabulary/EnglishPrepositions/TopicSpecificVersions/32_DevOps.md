# All English Prepositions with Examples - DevOps

**Comprehensive Reference Guide**

Updated: December 2024

## Introduction

English prepositions are words that connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other elements within a sentence, indicating relationships of direction, location, time, or other abstract connections. They function as "connector words" that link various parts of a sentence, making its meaning clear. For instance, "I went *to* the DevOps conference" shows "to" connecting the location "conference" to the action of going. There are approximately 150 prepositions in English, and three of the most commonly used words—"of," "to," and "in"—are prepositions. Prepositions are considered a 'closed class' of words, meaning new words are rarely added to this group over time.

**Note**: Each meaning entry below includes exactly three example sentences to demonstrate proper usage in different contexts, specifically related to DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and infrastructure management.

### Categories of English Prepositions

Prepositions are generally categorized by their structure, encompassing single-word forms, multi-word phrases, and even certain verbal forms that function as prepositions.
