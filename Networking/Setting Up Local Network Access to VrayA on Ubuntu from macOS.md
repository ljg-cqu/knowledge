# Setting Up Local Network Access to V2rayA on Ubuntu from macOS

This manual provides a comprehensive guide on accessing the V2rayA service running on an Ubuntu machine from a macOS device over a local network. It covers methods for direct access, routed connections through SSH tunneling, firewall configurations, command-line proxy environment variables, and how to set system-level proxy settings that can accommodate both approaches.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- Ubuntu machine with V2rayA listening on:
  - 20170 (SOCKS5)
  - 20171 (HTTP)
  - 20172 (HTTP with rule)
- macOS device on the same network

---

## Step 1: Get Ubuntu IP Address

```bash
hostname -I
```
Example output: `10.1.1.131 10.1.1.242`

---

## Step 2: Check the Firewall Status

Open Terminal on Ubuntu.  
Check if UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is active:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

## Step 3: Configure UFW Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow 20170/tcp  # SOCKS5
sudo ufw allow 20171/tcp  # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 20172/tcp  # HTTP with rule
```

---

## Step 4: Open Terminal on macOS

Launch the Terminal application from your macOS.

---

## Step 5: Create SSH Tunnels to Access V2rayA (Optional)

You can choose to set up SSH tunnels to route traffic securely. Use the IP address obtained in Step 1.

**A. SOCKS5 Proxy Connection**

In the first terminal window/tab, run:

```bash
ssh -D 20170 zealy@10.1.1.131
```

**B. HTTP Proxy Connection**

In a second terminal window/tab, run:

```bash
ssh -L 20171:localhost:20171 zealy@10.1.1.131
```

**C. HTTP (with Rule) Proxy Connection**

In a third terminal window/tab, run:

```bash
ssh -L 20172:localhost:20172 zealy@10.1.1.131
```

Enter your password for the `zealy` account when prompted for each SSH connection.

---

## Step 6: Configure Proxy Settings in macOS Applications (if using SSH Tunneling)

If you are using the SSH tunnels, configure your web browser or application to use the proxies. Use `localhost` for settings, as traffic will be routed through the SSH tunnels.

**A. For SOCKS5 Proxy**

- Type: SOCKS5
- Host: localhost
- Port: 20170

**B. For HTTP Proxy**

- Type: HTTP
- Host: localhost
- Port: 20171

**C. For HTTP (with Rule) Proxy**

- Type: HTTP
- Host: localhost
- Port: 20172

---

## Step 7: Direct Access to V2rayA (Without SSH Tunneling)

If you prefer to access V2rayA services directly without using SSH tunneling, follow these steps:

- Open a Web Browser or Application on macOS.
- Use the Ubuntu machineâ€™s IP address directly in the URL:

  - For HTTP Proxy:  
    URL: `http://10.1.1.131:20171`
  - For HTTP (with Rule) Proxy:  
    URL: `http://10.1.1.131:20172`

- For Command-Line Access in Terminal on macOS:  
  You can also access the HTTP service directly using curl. This is useful for testing or for command-line tools.

  ```bash
  curl http://10.1.1.131:20171
  ```

---

## Step 8: System-Level Proxy Settings on macOS

To enable a system-wide proxy that accommodates both SSH tunneling and direct connections, follow these steps:

1. Open **System Preferences**
   - Click on the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen.
   - Select System Preferences.
2. Access **Network Settings**
   - In System Preferences, click on Network.
   - Select the active network connection (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet) from the left pane.
3. Configure **Proxies**
   - Click the **Advanced** button in the lower right.
   - In the **Proxies** tab, you can set up the proxies. Check the boxes for the types of proxy you want to use:
     - **SOCKS Proxy:**  
       For SOCKS5, check SOCKS Proxy.  
       Set Server to `localhost` and Port to `20170`.
     - **HTTP and HTTPS Proxies:**  
       Check Web Proxy (HTTP) and Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS).  
       Set the Server to `localhost` and Port to `20171` for both.
   - Click OK, then Apply to save the settings.

**Notes on System-Level Proxy**

- **HTTP and HTTPS:** When configured, all applications will route their traffic through the specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy via the local SSH tunnel if active. If not using SSH tunneling, it will connect directly to the Ubuntu machine's IP.
- **SOCKS5:** Similarly, with the SOCKS proxy set to `localhost:20170`, you can route traffic through the SSH tunnel or establish direct connections if needed.

---

## Step 9: Set Proxy Environment Variables (for Terminal Applications)

If you want command-line applications on macOS to use the proxy settings, export the following environment variables:

**A. Open Terminal**

**B. Set Proxy Variables**

Run the following commands:

For HTTP and HTTPS Proxy:
```bash
export http_proxy='http://localhost:20171'
export https_proxy='http://localhost:20171'
```

For SOCKS Proxy:
```bash
export all_proxy='socks5://localhost:20170'
```

**C. Verify Proxy Settings (Optional)**

To ensure the environment variables are set correctly, run:
```bash
echo $http_proxy
echo $https_proxy
echo $all_proxy
```

---

## Step 10: Test Your Connection

- **Using SSH Tunneling:** Open your web browser or application configured with the appropriate proxies and check if you can access the desired service.
- **Direct Access:** Attempt to access V2rayA via the URLs specified in Step 7 or using the curl command directly in Terminal.
- **Using System-Level Proxy:** Open any application (like Safari) and try to access the internet to test the proxy configuration.

---

## Unsetting Proxy Variables

If you need to unset the proxy settings, you can do so by running:
```bash
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
unset all_proxy
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH Connection Issues:** Ensure you have the correct IP address and that the SSH service is running on Ubuntu.
- **Firewall Configuration:** Confirm that the necessary ports are allowed in the firewall if accessing directly.
- **Network Issues:** Ensure both your macOS and Ubuntu devices are on the same local network.

**Temporarily Disabling UFW**

If you need to troubleshoot firewall issues:
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```
*Caution: Remember to re-enable the firewall after testing:*
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

---

## Conclusion

You should now be equipped to access the V2rayA service on your Ubuntu machine from your macOS device using both direct connections and SSH tunneling with proxy settings. Additionally, you can configure system-level proxy settings that support both tunneling through SSH and direct network connections.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to seek further assistance.
