   - **Situation 1**: Training new team member one-on-one → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual—"Right, so it's a structured doc..."—builds rapport
   - **Situation 2**: Presenting to project stakeholders in meeting → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-formal—"It's a structured document that captures..."—professional without being stiff

   - **Situation 1**: Team member asks about project risk → **Appropriate Variant**: Casual—"Good question"—acknowledges without slowing momentum
   - **Situation 2**: Client challenges your methodology → **Appropriate Variant**: Formal—"That's an excellent question that merits consideration"—buys time respectfully

   - **Situation 2**: Manager outlines project plan → **Appropriate Variant**: Semi-formal—"That makes sense"—confirms understanding

   - *Cultural Context*: American culture accepts enthusiastic affirmation; European business prefers measured agreement
