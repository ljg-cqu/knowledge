### Phase 6: Rest/Recovery

**Q7: Sleep schedule decision: (A) 7hr sleep + 1hr morning routine (energy 85%, health baseline), (B) 8hr sleep + rushed morning (energy 95%, stress +15%), (C) 6hr sleep + extended evening (productivity -20%, health risk +30% long-term [Ref: A13]). Work performance requires 90% cognitive capacity. Health research: <7hr sleep → cardiovascular risk +25% [Ref: A1]. Assess health, performance, and strategic value?**

**Difficulty**: I | **Phase**: Rest/Recovery | **Value Types**: Health/Wellbeing, Productivity/Performance, Strategic (Long-term Health) | **Stakeholders**: Self, Family, Employer, Healthcare | **Decision Criticality**: Creates Risk (health deterioration +30% if <7hr chronic, performance impact -20%), Quantified Impact (cognitive performance ±20%, $2,400/yr healthcare cost differential [Ref: A13])

**Key Insight**: Sleep duration represents foundational investment with asymmetric risk profile—downside (chronic <7hr) creates compounding health costs ($2,400/yr) and performance degradation (-20%), while upside (8hr) provides cognitive resilience (+10%) and long-term disease prevention worth $50K+ over 20yr [Ref: A13].

**Answer** (~150 words):
Apply **Sleep ROI Framework** [Ref: L6] + **Cognitive Performance Model** [Ref: G17]. **Multi-value**: Health [G1]: 8hr sleep → +10% immune function, -25% cardiovascular risk [Ref: A1], -$2,400/yr healthcare costs vs. 6hr; 7hr = baseline; 6hr = +30% chronic disease risk (20yr), +$50K cumulative costs; Performance [G9]: 8hr → 95% cognitive capacity, 7hr → 85%, 6hr → 65% [Ref: A14]; Strategic [G5]: Sleep quality compounds—cognitive reserve supports career longevity +15yr [Ref: A13], burnout prevention worth $100K+ career value. **Stakeholders**: Self: energy vs. time; Family: evening availability; Employer: daily performance reliability (requires ≥90% capacity); Healthcare: preventive vs. reactive costs. **Trade-offs**: (A) 7hr: moderate all; (B) 8hr: optimal health/morning rush; (C) 6hr: evening time/health+performance loss. **Decision Criteria**: Choose (B) 8hr sleep as baseline (non-negotiable); compress morning routine to 45min via [T1] habit optimization. Avoid (C) except rare exceptions (<5% nights). **Metrics**: Sleep duration (tracked via [T7]), cognitive performance score, morning stress level, annual health costs. **Limitations**: Individual sleep needs vary ±30min; sleep quality matters (deep sleep % [T7]).

**Artifact**:

| Sleep Duration | Total Sleep | Morning Routine | Cognitive Capacity | Daily Energy | Health Risk (20yr) | Healthcare Cost (Annual) | Career Longevity | Strategic Value (20yr) |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| A. 7hr sleep | 7hr | 1hr structured | 85% | 85% (adequate) | Baseline | $800/yr baseline | Baseline | $0 |
| B. 8hr sleep | 8hr | 45min rushed | 95% | 95% (optimal) | -25% cardiovascular | $600/yr (-$200) | +15yr productive | +$75K (health+career) |
| C. 6hr sleep | 6hr | 1hr + 1hr evening | 65% | 70% (fatigue) | +30% chronic disease | $3,200/yr (+$2,400) | -10yr (burnout) | -$150K (health+career) |

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Option B (8hr sleep) as non-negotiable foundation—compress morning routine via habit optimization [T1]: clothes/meal prep night before, 20min exercise (vs. 30min), streamlined grooming. Calculate bedtime: 10:30 PM for 6:30 AM wake = 8hr. Use sleep tracker [T7] to optimize quality (target: ≥25% deep sleep). Reserve 6hr nights for exceptional circumstances only (<5%). Track: sleep duration/quality (weekly), cognitive performance (self-assessment daily), annual health checkup markers. **Investment**: $50/yr sleep tracker + $200/yr optimization (blackout curtains, white noise) = 10x ROI via health savings + performance gains.
