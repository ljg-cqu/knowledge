   **Colleague:** Hmm. [pause] That's 29x growth in four years.
   
   **Analyst:** Exactly. Exponential scaling for model training.
   
   **Colleague:** Makes sense, but that's aggressive capex.

1. Q: The EU Digital Omnibus might affect our AI Act compliance timeline. What's the potential delay and new deadline?
   A: **Regulatory Lead:** Could delay high-risk AI system rules by up to 16 months.
