*Description: This workflow illustrates how blockchain technology integrates into supplier risk management. During onboarding, supplier credentials and crucial data (financials, certifications, ESG information) are hashed and recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger. Smart contracts automatically verify this data against predefined compliance rules and generate a risk score. Procurement teams and risk analysts monitor real-time alerts and dashboards, informed by continuous data from IoT sensors and external feeds. Automated smart contracts also trigger payments upon verified conditions. The immutable ledger provides a clear audit trail for regulators, leading to benefits such as reduced fraud, faster onboarding, enhanced transparency, improved compliance, and proactive risk mitigation.*
