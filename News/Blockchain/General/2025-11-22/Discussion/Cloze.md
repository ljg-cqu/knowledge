## Security Considerations

1. Q: Cross-chain bridges and security—
   A: **Security A:** Top exploit vector. Over $2B lost in 2024.
   
   **Security B:** Wait, just in bridges?

**Cross-Chain Bridge Security:**
- **Risk Classification**: Top exploit vector
- **2024 Losses**: >$2 billion (bridges only)
- **Status**: High-risk, serious vulnerability

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: Cross-chain bridges represent the highest exploit risk in crypto infrastructure, with over $2B lost in 2024 alone. Exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough audits before deployment.
