| [**CodeGraphGPT**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11532) | Automates fuzz driver generation for software testing. | Constructs a knowledge graph of code repositories where nodes represent entities like functions or files, and edges capture relationships. | Automates fuzzing process, significantly reduces manual effort, and improves code coverage. | Research Project |
| [**CodexGraph**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03910) | Bridges LLMs with code repositories using graph database interfaces for precise code context retrieval and navigation. | Integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories, leveraging structural properties and graph query language. | Enables precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation for LLM agents. | Research Project |
| [**GraphCoder**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3691620.3695054) | Enhances repository-level code completion by leveraging code context graphs. | Captures context through code context graphs (CCG) consisting of control-flow, data- and control-dependence between code statements. | Achieves higher exact match (EM) on average while using less time and space compared to baseline methods. | Research Project |
| [**Sourcegraph Cody**](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) | AI coding assistant for code understanding, writing, and fixing. | Uses a code graph for accurate navigation, modeling entities and relationships for bug fixing, refactoring, and multi-repo insights. | Enterprise-grade security and scalability, saves significant developer time. | Freemium + Enterprise |
| [**CodeGPT**](https://codegpt.co) | AI agent platform for software development. | Employs knowledge graphs for codebase understanding, dependency analysis, and cross-repo navigation. | Strong for large-scale changes and onboarding, secure (SOC2 certified), supports multiple LLMs. | Freemium + Pro/Enterprise |
| [**Cognee**](https://www.cognee.ai/) | Knowledge graph tool for codebases. | Creates a multi-granular knowledge graph for Python code, capturing call graphs, imports, versions, and ownership. | Open-source core, excels in architectural explanations. | Open-Source + Enterprise |
| [**LocAgent**](https://github.com/gersteinlab/LocAgent) | Code localization using graph traversal and multi-hop LLM reasoning. | Uses a directed code graph for multi-hop reasoning and graph traversal. | Open source, cost-effective, and excellent for advanced engineering tasks. | Open-Source |
| [**CodeSee**](https://www.codesee.io) | Continuous code graph and flow visualizations. | Provides visual code maps, data flow, and cross-repo dependency management. | Holistic, cross-repo, dynamic dependency mapping for large teams. | Paid |
| [**Codeium**](https://codeium.com) | AI-powered code completion and search. | Offers dependency/structure graphs and natural language querying of the codebase. | Fast autocomplete, intelligent codebase search, and a generous free tier. | Free + Paid |

## Recommendations
