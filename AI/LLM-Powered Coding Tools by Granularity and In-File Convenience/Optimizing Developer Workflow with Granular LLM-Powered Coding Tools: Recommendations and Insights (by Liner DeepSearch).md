Find all LLM-powered coding tools that excel at different levels of granularity, especially those that provide a convenient way to generate, explain, and refactor code at the code-line or code-block level, either by comment, select-and-ask, or other convenient methods. Here is some context concerning my issues. I know there are many coding copilots; some excel at handling code from the codebase/whole project level, some are capable of handling multiple files simultaneously, and some can handle one code file perfectly. However, all these methods become inconvenient when I work within a code file context and want to generate, explain, and refactor code directly from within the file. This is because I need to explicitly specify the code location to handle, which causes an extra step and friction in the coding flow and user experience. I know Aider, the programming pair for programmers, supports using comments to directly edit code within a file. That's excellent. I need you to list all these copilots and classify them according to their support for different granularity. You should concisely clarify how they achieve that, appending corresponding official websites. Draw a SWOT analysis for each Copilot and a competitive analysis in a table.

### I. Understanding Granularity in LLM-Powered Coding Tools

The emergence of large language models has fundamentally reshaped how developers write code, introducing AI assistance that can generate and analyze code. Granularity in this context refers to the scope at which an AI coding tool can operate and provide assistance. This ranges from entire codebases and multi-file projects down to individual code blocks and single lines. Historically, developers spent considerable time manually poring over documentation and debugging code. However, modern AI tools now significantly accelerate this process by completing code, translating between languages, and auto-generating documentation.

The importance of fine-grained control stems from the desire to minimize friction in the coding workflow. When developers work within a code file and need to generate, explain, or refactor code, explicit specification of code location or extensive context switching can be inconvenient and time-consuming. Tools that support code-line or code-block level interaction, either through comment-driven commands, selection-based queries, or inline prompts, allow for a more seamless and intuitive experience. This direct interaction within the file context helps maintain developer focus and flow, boosting productivity and reducing cognitive load.
