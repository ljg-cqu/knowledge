# LLM-Powered Coding Tools: Enhancing Granularity in Code Generation, Explanation, and Refactoring

## Introduction/Overview

In the evolving landscape of software development as of August 2025, LLM-powered coding tools have become indispensable for developers seeking to streamline workflows. These tools leverage large language models to assist with code generation, explanation, and refactoring across various levels of granularity—from entire projects to specific lines or blocks. The key challenge addressed here is reducing friction in coding flows, particularly within a single file, where traditional tools often require explicit specification of code locations. Tools like Aider pioneered convenient methods such as comment-based editing, while others incorporate select-and-ask, inline suggestions, or natural language interactions. This report identifies leading tools, classifies them by granularity support, details their mechanisms, provides SWOT analyses, and includes a competitive comparison. Best use cases, recommendations, and a summary guide developers in selecting tools that minimize extra steps and enhance user experience.

## List of Tools and Classification by Granularity

Tools are classified based on their support for different granularity levels: 
- **Project Level**: Handles entire codebases, including navigation and edits across repositories.
- **Multi-File Level**: Edits and coordinates changes across multiple files.
- **File Level**: Focuses on single-file operations like completions and refactoring.
- **Line/Block Level**: Provides convenient, low-friction interactions (e.g., via comments, select-and-ask, inline suggestions) for generating, explaining, or refactoring specific code segments.

Each tool's mechanisms for achieving granularity are concisely described, along with official websites.

1. **Aider**  
   - **Classification**: Strong at project, multi-file, file, and line/block levels.  
   - **Mechanisms**: Uses terminal-based pair programming with LLMs; developers issue commands (e.g., /edit or /add) to modify specific lines or blocks via natural language descriptions. Supports in-file comments for direct edits, reducing friction by allowing changes without leaving the file context. Generation and refactoring occur through interactive LLM sessions; explanations via chat queries.

2. **GitHub Copilot**  
   - **Classification**: Excels at all levels, with robust project and multi-file support via agent mode.  
   - **Mechanisms**: Inline ghost text for line/block completions; select-and-ask via inline chat or agent mode for explanations and refactoring. Comments guide suggestions; agent mode automates multi-step edits (e.g., generating diffs for blocks). Next edit suggestions predict and apply changes at line level without manual specification.
